Robustness Analysis

Our main results are all based on a two-year bandwidth around the age thresholds with linear age
controls. Focusing on the model pooling both thresholds, Table A-4 shows the sensitivity of our
results when we allow for more flexibility in the estimation, focusing on five outcome variables.
Columns (2) and (3) show the estimated effects when the bandwidth is reduced to 1 year and 0.5
years. While the sample size drops dramatically and the standard errors increase correspondingly,
the point estimates all become larger in absolute terms, pointing to worse match outcomes than in
the baseline estimates. This pattern is very similar when we control for age with quadratic or cubic
polynomials on both sides of the cutoff (columns 3 and 4), where the point estimates are similar
to the linear specification with 0.5 years of bandwidth. Using the Calonico et al. (forthcoming)
optimal bandwidth algorithm - column (5) - we obtain optimal bandwidths between 0.6 to 0.7 and
again slightly more negative wage effecs.
In section 2 in the paper, we reported that we found a slight increase in density just to right
of the two age thresholds. Furthermore, we found a small increase in the fraction of female UI
recipients at the threshold. Here, we provide several methods to investigate whether this increase
will affect our results. Column (6) of Table A-4 shows the results from estimating the marginal
effect of potential benefit durations on employment outcomes using our RD design pooling both
thresholds, when we exclude all observations within one month of the age threshold. Overall,
while excluding the observations close to the cutoff reduces statistical power somewhat, it does
not affect our overall conclusions. Column (7) of Table A-4 shows another method robustness
check to limit the effect of selective waiting before claiming UI, where we limit the sample to
individuals who claim UI within two weeks of losing their job. These effects are quite similar to
our baseline results.
In Section 4, we had said that part of the effect on reemployment wages at the exhaustion points
month 12 and month 18 are likely to be due to a change in sample composition. In particular, there
is a rise in the fraction of women to the right of the RD cutoffs, and a rise in the fraction of women
exiting at the exhaustion points. To address this point, we have replicated our main RD analysis and
our analysis of reemployment wages by gender. While women’s nonemployment durations clearly
respond more strongly to UI extensions (Schmieder, von Wachter, and Bender 2012a), there is no
precisely estimated difference in the effect on reemployment wages by gender. As a result, the
implied IV estimate of the effect of nonemployment durations on wages is somewhat smaller for
women, and approximately the same for men. Hence, our main findings are robust for the small
degree of selection of women into nonemployment and UI exhaustion we find.
Another potential concern is that our main analysis focuses on workers with comparatively
high labor force attachment for whom nonemployment spells might be particularly costly. As

2

discussed in Section 2, we can replicate our IV strategy for any worker eligible for UI. For this
broader sample, Table ?? shows we obtain a somewhat larger estimate of −1.2% for the age 42
cutoff, and −1.5% when we pool both cutoffs, where only the latter is statistically significant from
our main sample.1 Thus, our findings are not driven by the particular sample we use, and hold for
a broad sample of middle aged workers in Germany. We also considered the effect of UI durations
and nonemployment durations on wages for other subgroups, but statistical precision was low and
hence did not pursue this further.2

Model Details

2.1

Optimal Reservation Wage and Search Intensity Paths

In the following we omit individual i subscripts from the model parameters to simplify notations.
Employment is an absorbing state, i.e. once employed a worker does not get laid off or move to
better jobs. Since workers discount the future at the common subjective discount rate ρ, the value
of being employed V e satisfies:
1
V e (w∗ ) = w∗ .
ρ
The Bellman equation for an unemployed worker is given as:


V (t) = bt + max −ψ(λt ) + (1 − λt )

Since V e (w∗ ) is increasing in w∗ , the optimal search behavior of the worker is described by
a reservation wage φt , so that all wage offers w∗ ≥ φt are accepted. This allows for writing the
Bellman equation as:

V (t) = bt + max −ψ(λt ) +

Suppose that the environment becomes stationary for some t ≥ T . In particular UI benefits and
the wage offer distribution become constant after T : bt = b, Ft (w∗ ) = FT (w∗ ). This implies that the
optimal search strategy is a constant: reservation wage φT . Using the fact that V u (t) = V u (t + 1) in
1 The

difference in the size of the IV estimate is mainly driven by a smaller effect of UI extensions on nonemployment durations, which is to be expected since the average rise of potential UI durations is smaller for this group.
2 For example, while lower educated workers had substantially larger responses in employment duration, the effect
of UI durations on wage changes appeared only slightly larger for the lower educated, implying a smaller (but not
precisely estimated) causal effect of nonemployment durations on wages.

intensity are given by the follwowing system of equations:

φT

An optimal search strategy in this model is described by a reservation wage φt and search
intensity λt in each period. In the appendix we show that the optimal reservation wage and search
intensity paths are described by the following pair of difference equations, where the reservation
wage and search intensity in period t − 1 can be derived from the reservatoin wage in period t.
In the nonstationary environment, t < T , we use the fact that: ρ1 φt = V u (t + 1). Therefore
knowledge about the reservation wage φt and the optimal search intensity λt in period t will allow
us to find the reservation wage in period t − 1 using this equation:
ˆ

∞

(1 + ρ)φt−1 = (1 + ρ)ρ (bt−1 − ψ(λt )) + φt + λt

w∗ − φt dFt (w∗ )

Once we have found the reservation wage φt−1 in period t − 1 we can directly solve for the optimal
search intensity in the same period:
ˆ

(1 + ρ)ρψ (λt−1 ) −

w∗ − φt−1 dFt (w∗ ) = 0

φt−1

In our empirical application we consider a system where UI benefits are at a constant level b up
to the maximum potential duration of receiving UI benefits P. After benefit exhaustion, indivduals
receive a second tier of payments indefinitely. We therefore have that bt = b for all t ≤ P and bt = b
for all t > P. Consider how the reservation wage path and the search intensity path is affected by a
change in potential UI durations P. Using the first order conditions we get that:

If there is at least a small chance that individuals might not find a job until UI exhaustion at
t = P, then increasing P will increase the value of remaining unemployed for all t ≤ P, so that
u
dVt+1
dP > 0. Therefore increasing P will increase the reservation wage φt and lower search intensity

Therefore if the extension in UI benefits affects the value of being unemployed in period t, then
it will lower the probability of leaving unemployment in that period.

Derivation of Equation (7) in main text

The expected reemployment wage of individual i conditional on t is given as:
´∞
wei (t, P) = E[w(ti , P, ζi , u)|ti , ζi ] =

φt

w∗ dFt (w∗ )

1 − Ft (φt )

Individual unemployment duration ti = t(P, ζi , ε) is equal to the first period when a job offer
arrives with a wage above the reservation wage. Thus ε is a vector of indicators signifying whether
for each period there is a job offer with a wage above the reservation wage: ε = {I[ job_o f f ert ] ×
I[w∗ ≥ φt ]} for t = 0, 1, ... Note that the realized ε does not contain information about the value
realized of realized wage offers conditional on being above the reservation wage.
We denote the distribution of ε for an individual with parameters ζi as dH(ε; ζi ) and therefore
´
the expected unemployment duration of an individual is: tie (P, ζi ) = t(P, ζi , ε)dH(ε; ζi )
The expected reemployment wage of individual i (not conditioning on unemployment duration)
wei (P) = E[wei (t, P)|ζi ] can be obtained by integrating over H(t; ζi ):
ˆ
wei (P) = E[w(ti , P, ζi , u)|ζi ] =

wei (t, P) dH(ε; ζi )

The expected reemployment wage in population conditional on t, we (t, P) = E[wei (t, P)|t] is
obtained by integrating over the distribution of ζi :
ˆ
e

w (t, P) = E[w(ti , P, ζi , u)|t] =

wei (t, P) dG(ζi )

The expected unconditional reemployment wage we (P) = E[wei (t, P)] = E[wei (P)] = E[we (t, P)]
can then be obtained by integrating over durations t and parameters ζi
ˆ ˆ

Now we have that:

we (P + h) − we (P) = E [wei (t(P + h), P + h) − wei (t(P), P)]
= E [wei (t(P + h), P + h) − wei (t(P + h), P) + wei (t(P + h), P) − wei (t(P), P)]
= E [wei (t(P + h), P + h) − wei (t(P + h), P)] + E [wei (t(P + h), P) − wei (t(P), P)]

to an increase in the reemployment wage conditional on time t (wei (t, P)) and on the reservation
dV u
wage φit , and thus dPit ). However, if the reservation wage is not or on only weakly binding,
then the reemployment wage will only change little while the ratio will decline, leading to a low
covariance. This reinforces the result that the IV estimate is likely an upper bound of the (negative)
effect on nonemployment duration on reemployment wages as long as reservation wages do not
have a strong effect on reemployment wages. A numerically small negative covariance would tend
to imply our calculated bounds are too wide.

Empirical Implementation
Upward Bias in Wage Regression

Consider first the case in which the effect of potential UI durations on wages is the same at all
nonemployment durations, and which the effect of nonemployment durations on wages is linear.
We are interested in an estimate of the coefficient δ in the linear model
w∗i = α + δPi + θti + ui
where w=wage, P=potential UI durations, t=actual nonemployment durations. This is a linear
version of equation (9) in the main text, where we have dropped the low-order polynomial in age
for simplicity. Instead, we assume directly that we have that cov(P, u) = 0 and E[u] = 0. Moreover,
we know that cov(P,t) 6= 0 and suspect thatcov(t, u) 6= 0. In matrix notation, the OLS coefficient
for δ from the short regression is
P0 Mt w (Mt P)0 Mt w
=
,
δˆ = 0
P Mt P
P0 Mt P
where Mx ≡ 1 − Px = 1 − x(x0 x)−1 x0 is the orthogonal projector onto the space orthogonal to x, and
Px is the orthogonal projector onto the space of x.
The numerator of the expression for the OLS estimator for δ is what is important. Since we
have Mt w = δMt P + Mt u, we have that
(Mt P)0 Mt w = δP0 Mt P + P0 Mt u,
where the omitted variable bias term can be rewritten as P0 Mt u = P0 u−P0 Pt u = −P0 Pt u = −(Pt P)0 Pt u,
where we used the fact that cov(P, u) = E[Pu] ≈ P0 u/N = 0 given that E[u] = 0. As a result we get
P0 Mt w
−P0 Pt u
δˆ = 0
= δ+ 0
P Mt P
P Mt P

9

Since P is uncorrelated with u, the second term in this expression can only be zero if there is
no endogeneity, i.e., if cov(u,t) = 0. (This is the intution behind the test for endogeneity by
Davidson and McKinnon, which tests the null hypothesis that the coefficient on the instrument
when directly included in the ’structural’ regression is zero, where δ would be equal to zero in a
standard IV setting). This implies that if nonemployment durations are endogenous, we cannot
directly estimate the average shift of the reemployment wage path from our data.
However, it turns out that with reasonable assumptions we can bound the true δ. To see this,
note that P0 Pt u = (P0t)(t 0t)−1 (t 0 u). The first product is simply the sum of nonemployment durations for those above the age cutoff, and hence strictly greater zero. The middle term is also
strictly greater zero. In contrast, we have that cov(u,t) = E(ut) = t 0 u/N. Hence, under the reasonable assumption that t 0 u ≤ 0, i.e., on average workers with lower earnings potential have longer
nonemployment spells, we obtain that that δˆ is an upper bound for the true δ. Since from the theory,

Notes: Standard errors clustered on day relative to cutoff level (* P<.05, ** P<.01)).
The sample are individuals who started receiving unemployment insurance between 1987 and 1999 within 2 years from the age
thresholds. Each coefficient is from a separate regression discontinuity model with the dependent variable given in the column
heading. The first panel shows the increase at the discontinuity at the age 42 threshold (where potential UI durations increase from
12 to 18 months). The second panel shows the increase at the age 44 threshold (where potential UI durations increase from 18 to 22
months). The third panel pools both thresholds. The models control for linear splines in age with different slopes on each side of the
cutoff.

calculated using the Calonico et al. algorithm.
The sample are individuals who started receiving unemployment insurance between 1987 and 1999. Each panel shows the increase at the age
threshold of the dependent variable (given in the panel title) rescaled by the average increase in potential UI durations at the thresholds. The
columns refer to different estimating the RD model with different bandwidths and controlling for different polynomials in age.

Notes: The table shows the implied slope of the mean wage offer distribution if the effect of potential UI durations
on reemployment wages conditional on nonemployment durations is not equal to zero dE[w|t]/dP. Rows show the
dVu/dt
implied slope for different values of dE[w|t]/dP and columns for different values of dVu/dP
. The preferred point
Estimate for dE[w|t]/dP is 0.015% (from last column and bottom panel of Table 10).
The upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for dE[w|t]/dP is 0.095%.
