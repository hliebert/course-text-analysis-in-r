Summary. The paper assesses the heterogeneity of treatment effects arising from variation in
the duration of training. We use German administrative data that have the extraordinary feature
that the amount of treatment varies continuously from 10 days to 395 days (i.e. 13 months). This
feature allows us to estimate a continuous dose–response function that relates each value of
the dose, i.e. days of training, to the individual post-treatment probability of employment (the
response). The dose–response function is estimated after adjusting for covariate imbalance
by using the generalized propensity score, which is a recently developed method for covariate
adjustment under continuous treatment regimes. Our data have the advantage that we can consider both the actual and the planned durations of training as treatment variables: if only actual
durations are observed, treatment effect estimates may be biased because of endogenous
exits. Our results indicate an increasing dose–response function for treatments of up to 120
days, which then flattens out, i.e. longer training programmes do not seem to add an additional
treatment effect.

Introduction

Over recent years there has been an increasing amount of research on the effectiveness of labour
market training programmes in many countries. Training programmes represent the ‘classic’
type of so-called active labour market programmes, owing to their objective of enhancing participants’ employment prospects by increasing their human capital. Whereas the evidence on
early training programmes in the 1970s and 1980s showed relatively optimistic results, the
more recent research from the 1990s and 2000s—generally based on much better data and

advanced econometric methods—points to the result that training programmes seem to be
modestly effective at best (Heckman et al., 1999; Kluve, 2010). Adding to this general ﬁnding,
one recent line of research shows that positive treatment effects may only materialize in the long
run, and that programme effectiveness can show a considerable dynamic ranging from often
severe short-term locking-in effects to long-term gains in employment prospects (e.g. Lechner
et al. (2011)).
In the previous training literature, the focus is typically on binary treatment effects and there
is no differentiation of training programmes by their duration. The provision of training, however, can be quite heterogeneous both in terms of content of training and in terms of duration
of training. In this paper we contribute to the literature on training programmes by focusing on
the heterogeneity of treatment effects that may arise from variation in the duration of treatment.
We implement this analysis on the basis of data on training programmes in Germany. The key
feature of the data is the fact that the duration of treatment varies almost continuously from
approximately 1 week up to approximately 13 months. We focus on programmes in which no
speciﬁc vocational degree is acquired as part of the requirements of the programme—this is the
majority of training programmes in Germany. Participants in these programmes learn speciﬁc
skills that are required for a certain vocation, like computer-aided design for technicians, or
receive qualiﬁcations that are of general vocational use, like general computer skills. In this
paper we compare the effect of being trained within the same type of programme, but with
different durations, on the subsequent probability of employment.
The evaluation question that corresponds to the continuous administering of training is how
effective (relative to each other) are training programmes with different durations? This assessment of the heterogeneity of treatment effects along the duration dimension essentially amounts
to estimating a dose–response function as proposed in Hirano and Imbens (2004). In this paper
we therefore estimate the response—i.e. the probability of employment—that corresponds to
speciﬁc values of continuous doses—i.e. training of a particular length.
In a setting in which doses are not administered under experimental conditions, estimation
of a dose–response function is possible by using the generalized propensity score (GPS). The
GPS for continuous treatments is a straightforward extension of the well-established and widely
used propensity score methodology for binary treatments (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983) and
multivalued treatments (Imbens, 2000; Lechner, 2001). The GPS methodology is developed in
Hirano and Imbens (2004) and Imai and van Dyk (2004). Similarly to the binary and multivalued
treatment propensity score methods it is assumed that—conditional on observable characteristics—the level of treatment received can be considered as random. Hirano and Imbens (2004)
showed that the GPS has a balancing property that is similar to the balancing property of the
‘classic’ propensity score. This implies that individuals within the same strata of the GPS should
be identical in terms of their observable characteristics, independent of their level of treatment.
Compared with propensity score methods for multivalued treatments, the GPS has the advantage that we do not have to discretize the continuously distributed duration of training and thus
can make use of more comprehensive information. To our knowledge, our paper along with
parallel work by Flores et al. (2011) constitute the ﬁrst applications of the GPS in the context
of evaluating active labour market programmes.
In implementing the GPS approach, our data have the advantage that we can consider both
the actual and the planned durations of training as treatment variables: if only actual durations
are observed, treatment effect estimates may be biased because of endogenous exits. This could
be the case, for instance, if observed durations are shorter than the initially planned durations,
because people exit from the programme early if they ﬁnd a job. The bias could also point the
other way, if a substantial fraction of programme participants drop out early. We investigate

these issues by taking into account both the actual and the planned durations of individual
programme participants.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives details on the data and the treatment that we
study. Section 3 describes the methodology of estimating a dose–response function to evaluate
a continuous policy measure, adjusting for the GPS. The fourth section contains the empirical
implementation. It discusses the plausibility of the unconfoundedness assumption, it details the
GPS estimation, the common support condition and the balancing of covariates, and it presents
the results from estimating the dose–response function. Section 5 contains several robustness
checks. Section 6 concludes.

Institutional setting and data

2.1. Public training programmes in Germany
The most important German Government labour market policy that is relevant to our paper
is social code III (Sozialgesetzbuch III ) that was enacted in 1998. The focus group for social
code III consists of people who are unemployed or under threat of unemployment. The code
has emphasized the use of an active labour market policy and aims to reduce unemployment.
The Federal Employment Agency through its 10 regional directorates and 180 local employment agencies (with around 660 branch ofﬁces) is responsible for implementation of the federal
labour market policy at national, regional and local level. See Wunsch (2005) for a detailed
description of German labour market policy and related institutions.
Training programmes are one of the most important components of an active labour market
policy in Germany with an annual budget of around €7 billion (2002 ﬁgures; see Eichhorst and
Zimmermann (2007)). Access to training programmes is not a legal entitlement but is based on
the decision of the caseworker. If a caseworker has decided that her client needs to go through a
training programme, the caseworker also speciﬁes the type, the content and the duration of the
training and refers the client to a designated training provider. During the process, the factors
that the caseworker takes into consideration include the aptitude of her client for a certain job,
the likelihood of succeeding in a speciﬁc training programme, the local labour market condition,
the cost of training and to some extent the available training slots in the contracted training
institutions. It is thus reasonable to assume that once we condition on the large set of observable
characteristics, including previous labour market outcomes, the decision about the length of
the programme is independent of the future labour market outcomes of the participants.
Among the programmes that are considered here we can distinguish between classroomoriented training (type 1) and more practically oriented programmes with only a few theoretical parts (type 2). However, the duration as well as the effectiveness of both types are very
similar and therefore we pool both programmes to increase our sample size. Participants in the
programmes that we consider learn speciﬁc skills required for a certain vocation (e.g. computeraided design for a technician or tracer, ‘berufsbezogene Weiterbildung’) or receive qualiﬁcations
that are of general vocational use (e.g. Microsoft Ofﬁce and computer skills, ‘berufsübergreifende Weiterbildung’). Numerically, these types constitute the most important among all publicly
ﬁnanced training programmes: in 2000, roughly 70% of all participants in training were assigned
to these two types (Schneider and Uhlendorff, 2006; Institute for the Study of Labor et al., 2007).
Whereas the programmes that we focus on do not lead to a vocational degree, participants may
receive a certiﬁcate about the type and the content of the training. Programmes leading to the

590

acquisition of a degree are not considered, since the degree requirement generates discontinuities in the distribution of treatment durations, and the objective of the analysis in this paper
is to estimate the employment outcomes that are associated with each level of a continuous
treatment. Programmes leading to a vocational degree have a duration of around 2 years—see
for example Lechner et al. (2011) for an analysis of these long-term programmes.
2.2. Data
We use a sample of a particularly rich administrative data set, the integrated employment biographies of the German Federal Employment Agency (Bundesagentur für Arbeit). The data
contain detailed daily information on employment subject to social security contributions,
including occupational and sectoral information, receipt of transfer payments during periods
of unemployment, job search activity and participation in different programmes of an active
labour market policy. Furthermore, the integrated employment biographies comprise a large
variety of covariates like age, education, disability, nationality and regional indicators.
Our sample of participants consists of about 265 male unemployed people per quarter entering the programme during the years 2000, 2001 and 2002, i.e. we observe approximately 3180
programme participants. The system of publicly ﬁnanced training in Germany underwent several alterations during labour policy reforms in 2003 (see Jacobi and Kluve (2007)). We therefore
restrict our analysis to pre-reform training programmes to avoid possible distortions in measuring programme effectiveness. The data were generated as part of a research project for the
German government evaluating these labour policy reforms. To capture trends over time and to
separate this from the reform effect in 2003, the original sample consists of entry cohorts over
time with stable cohort size per quarter.
The data allow us to draw conclusions on the average participant starting a programme during this time period. The core feature of the training programmes that we analyse is the fact
that the provision of treatment is a continuous variable. For all participants we know the initial
length of the treatment that they were assigned to (i.e. the planned duration), as well as how
long they actually stayed in the treatment (i.e. the actual duration).
One caveat is that we do not have detailed information on the content of the training. Although
we restrict our analysis to two relatively homogeneous types of training programmes, we cannot
rule out that the content of the training could vary with the duration of training. Our estimates
may reﬂect the composite effect of duration of training and content of training. Nonetheless,
our paper still has strong policy implications and reﬂects the reality that content of training and
duration of training are usually offered together as a bundle to the programme applicants.
We discard observations with duration of treatment below 10 days, since such short durations arguably do not imply a serious attempt at ﬁnishing the programme. Durations above
395 days are also discarded, since only very few observations are available. We do not consider
durations of length 0, i.e. no non-treated individuals are included (though we do estimate the
baseline counterfactual outcome of those non-treated separately to facilitate interpreting our
main results). Instead, we focus on the average responses of those individuals who did receive
some treatment. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of duration of treatment, for both the actual and
the planned durations. Both distributions cover the full range of durations of training, and for
both distributions two peaks exist at durations of 180 days and 360 days. Fig. 1 also shows that
actual durations tend to be slightly shorter than planned durations.
The responses, i.e. the outcome variables of interest, are
(a) the probability of employment at time 1 year after exit from the programme and
(b) the probability of employment at time 2 years after entry into the programme.

Distributions of actual ( ) and planned () durations of training

Table 1 presents summary statistics of the two outcome variables and the covariates, for the full
sample (columns (1) and (2)) as well as for three subsamples, ‘early exits’ (i.e. actual duration
shorter than planned duration: columns (3) and (4)), ‘late exits’ (i.e. actual duration longer
than planned duration: columns (5) and (6)) and ‘exits as planned’ (i.e. actual duration equal to
planned duration: columns (7) and (8)). The share of individuals who stayed in the programme
exactly as long as planned is quite high (68.7%). In the case in which actual and planned durations differ, early exits are much more common than late exits (22.1% and 9.2% of observations
respectively), which is a pattern that has already been observed in Fig. 1.
As Table 1 shows, the data contain a large number of covariates. In particular, we can use
information on numerous variables that have been identiﬁed in the programme evaluation literature to be important determinants of selection into a programme: this comprises detailed
data on citizenship and educational background, including vocational education. Moreover,
we have detailed information on pretreatment employment histories, covering the number of
days spent in employment and unemployment during the 4 years preceding treatment and the
previous employment states measured at 12 points in time (4, 8, . . . , 48 weeks before entering
the programme) as well as regional indicators. When using non-experimental estimators, previous studies, e.g. Heckman et al. (1998), Diaz and Handa (2006) and Mueser et al. (2007),
have emphasized the importance of having treated and comparison groups from the same local
labour market, applying the same survey instrument for both groups and having rich information on individuals’ recent labour market history. First, given that our data come from one
administrative source, the requirement of a homogeneous survey instrument is certainly satisﬁed. Second, the richness of the covariates makes the weak unconfoundedness assumption
plausible (see also below). Third, our sample is a random sample of participants from West
Germany, such that, to control for local labour market conditions, we condition on the local
rate of unemployment and the regional type, reﬂecting the general performance of the regional
labour market (for a description of the various regional types see Blien et al. (2004)). This and
the fact that we analyse a national programme ensure that different effects of different lengths of
programme are not driven by different regional administrations or different local labour market
conditions.

Table 1 also shows that the covariate distributions are very similar across all (sub)samples,
which indicates that selection into the different subsamples on the basis of observable characteristics is not strong. In the remainder of this paper we shall therefore focus on presenting results
for the actual durations of the full sample, complementing these results with planned durations
and the sample of actual equal to planned durations as appropriate. Looking at the full sample,
the participants are on average 37 years old, around 9% of them are handicapped and 12%
do not have German citizenship. The participants are on average relatively low skilled: more
than 60% did not progress further than the ﬁrst stage of secondary level education, around 35%
do not have any vocational degree and only a minority (7%) have obtained a university
degree.
Before entering training the participants were on average unemployed for 9 months, and
their previous employment lasted for about 21 months. The individuals for whom we observe
a wage for their last employment earned around €50 per day. For the previous employment
history we construct eight variables describing the share of time spent in employment and
unemployment during each of the four years before entering the programme. There is a clearly
increasing trend in the average probability of being unemployed over time as the individuals
move closer to enrolment in the programme. This is also reﬂected in the decreasing share of individuals who are employed measured at 12 points in time during the year before the programme
starts.
Looking at the two outcome variables, both 2 years after entry to the programme and 1 year
after the programme ended around 35% of the participants are employed. Fig. 2 contains two
panels plotting unadjusted outcomes—i.e. the probability of employment 2 years after entry to
the programme as well as the probability of employment 1 year after exit from the programme—
against the actual duration of training. Figs 2(a) and 2(b) generally show an increasing trend:
after an initial dip in the probability of employment during the ﬁrst weeks in the programme,
employment rates seem to increase with the length of participation.

Removal of bias by using the generalized propensity score

Research in programme evaluation in recent years has made comprehensive use of matching
methods (see inter alia the overview in Augurzky and Kluve (2007) and a symposium on the
econometrics of matching in The Review of Economics and Statistics, volume 86 (2004), part 1,
pages 1–194, in particular the article by Imbens (2004)). In the absence of experimental data,
which is largely the case, the popularity of matching is due to its intuitively appealing technique of mimicking an experiment ex post. The standard case, which is also appropriate for the
majority of applications, considers a binary treatment. One of the key results that have made
matching such an attractive empirical tool was developed in Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983), who
showed that, rather than conditioning on the full set of covariates, conditioning on the propensity score—i.e. the probability of receiving the treatment given the covariates—is sufﬁcient to
balance treatment and comparison groups.
Subsequently, the literature has extended propensity score methods to the cases of multivalued treatments (Imbens, 2000; Lechner, 2001) and, more recently, continuous treatments
(Imbens, 2000; Hirano and Imbens, 2004; Imai and van Dyk, 2004). In this paper, we build on
the approach that was developed by Hirano and Imbens (2004) who proposed estimating the
entire dose–response function of a continuous treatment. This approach ﬁts perfectly with the
objective of our paper, since we are interested in the response—i.e. the post-treatment probability of employment—that is associated with each value of the continuous dose, i.e. the days spent
in training. Alternatively we could discretize the continuously distributed treatment variable

and apply propensity score methods for multivalued treatments. The GPS, though, has the
advantage that it makes use of the entire information contained in the distribution of duration
of treatment.
3.1. Generalized propensity score methodology
Hirano and Imbens (2004) developed the GPS methodology in the context of the potential
outcomes model for estimation of causal effects of treatments. In what follows we closely follow
their presentation. We have a random sample of training participants, indexed by i = 1, . . . , N.
For each unit i there is a set of potential outcomes Yi .t/—the employment state—for t ∈ , which
is referred to as the unit level dose–response function. In the continuous case,  is an interval
[t0 , t1 ], whereas in the binary case it would be  = {0, 1}. Our objective is to estimate the average
dose–response function μ.t/ = E[Yi .t/]. For each participant i, we observe a vector of covariates
Xi , the duration Ti of the training that individual i actually receives, with Ti ∈ [t0 , t1 ], and the

596

J. Kluve, H. Schneider, A. Uhlendorff and Z. Zhao

potential outcome corresponding to the level of treatment received, Yi = Yi .Ti /. In the remainder
of this section the subscript i will be omitted to simplify the notation.
The key assumption of Hirano and Imbens (2004) generalizes the unconfoundedness assumption for binary treatments that was made by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) to the continuous
case:
Y.t/ ⊥ T |X

for all T ∈ :

.1/

Hirano and Imbens (2004) referred to this as weak unconfoundedness, since it only requires conditional independence to hold for each value of the treatment, rather than joint independence of
all potential outcomes. Calling r.t, x/ = fT |X .t|x/ the conditional density of the treatment given
the covariates, the GPS is deﬁned as
R = r.T , X/:

.2/

The GPS has a balancing property that is similar to the balancing property of the propensity
score for binary treatments. Within strata with the same value of r.t, X/ the probability that
T = t does not depend on the value of X , i.e. the GPS has the property that X ⊥ 1{T = t}|r.t, X/.
Hirano and Imbens (2004) emphasized that this is a mechanical implication of the deﬁnition
of the GPS and does not require weak unconfoundedness. In combination with weak unconfoundedness, however, it implies that assignment to treatment is unconfounded given the GPS,
i.e. Hirano and Imbens (2004) proved that, if assignment to treatment is weakly unconfounded
given covariates X , then it is also weakly unconfounded given the GPS.
Given this result, it is possible to use the GPS to remove bias that is associated with differences
in covariates in three steps. The ﬁrst step consists of modelling and estimating the GPS. The
second step is to estimate the conditional expectation of the outcome as a function of two scalar
variables: the treatment level T and the GPS R, i.e.
β.t, r/ = E[Y |T = t, R = r]:

.3/

For the estimation of equation (3) we must assume some functional form of the relationship
between the employment state Y , the training duration T and the GPS R. The third step is
to estimate the dose–response function at each particular level of the treatment. This is implemented by averaging the conditional expectation function over the GPS at that particular level
of the treatment:
μ.t/ = E[β{t, r.t, X/}]:

.4/

The procedure does not average over the GPS R = r.T , X/, but instead it averages over the score
evaluated at the treatment level of interest r.t, X/. Hirano and Imbens (2004) also emphasized
that the regression function β.t, r/ does not have a causal interpretation, but that μ.t/ corresponds to the value of the dose–response function for treatment value t, which compared with
another treatment level t  does have a causal interpretation.
3.2. Implementation
In the practical implementation of the methodology that was outlined in the previous section,
we use a normal distribution for the duration of training given the covariates
Ti |Xi ∼ N.β0 + β1 Xi , σ 2 /,

.5/

which we estimate by ordinary least squares regression. It is possible to assume other distributions than the normal distribution, and to estimate the GPS by other methods such as maximum

likelihood, or to use non-parametric methods for partial means. The key point here, however,
is to make sure that the covariates are balanced after adjusting for the GPS: as long as sufﬁcient covariate balance is achieved, the exact procedure for estimating the GPS is of secondary
importance. We alternatively estimated the GPS on the basis of the logarithm of the duration
as a check of robustness, but using duration instead of the logarithm of the duration turned out
to be superior in ﬁnding GPS speciﬁcations that balance the covariates in our sample. The GPS
estimated is calculated as

In the second stage we calculate the conditional expectation function of the probability of
employment Yi given Ti and Ri as a ﬂexible function of its two arguments. Our empirical approach
uses the following polynomial approximation:
E[Yi |Ti , Ri ] = α0 + α1 Ti + α2 Ti2 + α3 Ti3 + α4 Ri + α5 R2i + α6 R3i + α7 Ti Ri + α8 Ti2 Ri + α9 Ti R2i :
.7/
In addition to the speciﬁcation in equation (7) we also implement several other speciﬁcations
to allow for sufﬁciently ﬂexible functional forms. On the one hand we vary the degree of the
polynomial speciﬁcation to test whether our results are robust with respect to a higher degree of
ﬂexibility. On the other hand we apply ﬂexible spline models to avoid a parametric speciﬁcation.
Spline models are a non-parametric regression technique. They are not only ﬂexible, but they
also have good properties in terms of the mean-squared error ﬁt. Another attractiveness is that
they are relatively easy to implement; see Keele (2008). Mofﬁtt (2009) applied a spline model in
the context of estimating marginal treatment effects.
For each individual the observed duration of training Ti and estimated GPS R̂i are used,
and the equation is estimated by ordinary least squares. Given the estimated parameters in the
second stage, we estimate the average potential outcome at treatment level t as
E[Y.t/] =

.8/

The entire dose–response function can then be obtained by estimating this average potential
outcome for each level of the treatment. In our application, we use bootstrap methods to obtain
standard errors that take into account estimation of the GPS and the α-parameters, i.e. we
bootstrap the entire estimation process.
3.3. Assessing the weak unconfoundedness assumption, common support condition
and balancing of covariates
The key assumption for the GPS is the weak unconfoundedness assumption, which is also
known as the assumption of selection on observables. As an identifying assumption, it is not
statistically testable. One potential case of violating this assumption is the possibility of reverse
causality. Individuals might leave the training programme because they have received an acceptable job offer. In this case, ﬁnding a job leads to a shorter duration of training. The planned
duration is determined before the programme, which is free from endogenous exit and plausibly
exogenous once we condition on detailed observed characteristics including previous labour
market history. We can use the information on the planned duration as an instrumental variable
to test the potential endogeneity due to reverse causality of the actual duration of treatment. If

598

we assume that the planned duration is exogenous, this allows us to take potential endogeneity
into account which may occur because of reverse causality or because some individuals leave
the programme because they expect no further beneﬁts from continuing the programme. This
approach does not allow us to test whether there are unobservable characteristics (unobserved
to researchers, but observable to the programme applicants and caseworkers) like motivation
or self-esteem which may have an effect on both, the planned and the observed duration of
the training programme, and which are relevant for subsequent labour market outcomes. However, the detailed information on previous labour market outcomes that is contained in our
data makes it very likely that unobservable characteristics such as motivation or self-esteem are
captured by the individual labour market history.
Similarly to standard propensity score matching methods, common support is also a concern
in the GPS application. We propose to test the common support condition as follows (Flores
et al. (2011) use a similar approach): ﬁrst, we divide the sample into three groups according to
the distribution of length of treatment, cutting at the 30th and 70th percentile of the distribution.
Then we evaluate the GPS at the group median of the treatment duration variable. For example,
we evaluate the GPS for the whole sample at the median treatment duration of group 1, and
after that we plot the distribution of the evaluated GPS for group 1 against the distribution of
the GPS for the rest of the sample. Like in the case of binary propensity score matching, by
inspecting the overlap of these two distributions we can examine the common support condition graphically. In the same fashion, we can test the common support condition of groups 2
and 3 versus the rest of the sample. Finally, we restrict our ﬁnal sample to individuals who are
comparable across the three groups simultaneously, i.e. we drop those participants whose GPS
is not among the common support region for all three groups.
Finally, in addition to assessing the identifying assumption and common support, in the
case of a continuous treatment it is also crucial to evaluate how well adjustment for the GPS
works in balancing the covariates, i.e. whether the speciﬁcation for estimation of expression (5)
is adequate. Whereas in the binary case the typical approach is to compare the covariate means
for the treated and control units before and after matching, testing for covariate balance is more
difﬁcult with continuous treatments. We apply three approaches to test the balancing properties
of the GPS.
In the ﬁrst approach we follow Imai and van Dyk (2004) who proposed to evaluate the balancing of the covariates by regressing each covariate on the treatment variable
(a) without and
(b) with conditioning
on the predicted training duration E[T |Xi ]. Once we condition on E[T |Xi ] we expect that the
duration of training is not correlated with the covariate if adjustment for the GPS works in
balancing the observable characteristics. We use a log-transformation of the treatment variable
since the duration of training is mechanically uncorrelated with each continuous covariate given
E[T |Xi ] (see appendix B in Imai and van Dyk (2004)).
In the second approach we propose to regress each covariate on the treatment variable
(a) without and
(b) with conditioning
on the distribution of the GPS Ri . Ri is evaluated at different potential values of the treatment
level, the 25th, the 50th and the 75th percentile of the training duration. The basic idea is similar to the ﬁrst approach: once we condition on the distribution of Ri the duration of training
should be uncorrelated with the covariate if the GPS properly balances the covariates. For both

approaches we employ linear regression models in the case of continuous covariates and probit
models for binary covariates.
Finally, we follow Hirano and Imbens’s (2004) approach of ‘blocking on the score’ and divide
the sample into three groups according to the distribution of length of treatment, cutting at the
30th and 70th percentile of the distribution. Within each group we evaluate the GPS at the
median of the treatment variable. Then, in the second step we divide each group into ﬁve blocks
by the quintiles of the GPS evaluated at the median. Within each of these blocks we calculate
the difference in means of covariates with respect to individuals who have a GPS such that they
belong to that block but have a treatment level that is different from the one being evaluated.
This procedure tests whether for each of these blocks the covariate means of individuals belonging to the particular treatment level group are signiﬁcantly different from those of individuals
with a different treatment level, but similar GPS. A weighted average over the ﬁve blocks in each
treatment level group can be used to calculate the t-statistic of the differences in means between
the particular treatment level group and all other groups. The procedure needs to be repeated for
each treatment level group and for each covariate. If adjustment for the GPS properly balances

the covariates, we would expect all those differences in means to be not statistically different
from 0. Note, though, that this test might suffer from ‘balance test fallacy’, i.e. we might observe
for some covariates decreased t-statistics which might be driven by increased variances and not
by decreased mean differences (see Imai et al. (2008) for a general discussion of balance test
fallacy in the context of binary matching approaches). It is therefore important to apply multiple
approaches to test the balancing property of the GPS.

Empirical results

4.1. Estimates from a probit model
As mentioned in Section 2, in this paper we consider two outcome variables: one is the probability of employment at the point in time 2 years after the participants entered the programme.
This corresponds to the standard approach in the literature on the effectiveness of training
programmes: outcomes of participants and non-participants are compared at speciﬁc points in
time after the programme started. However, in our analysis participants leave the programme
at different points in time. Since the intensity of search for a new job might be low during

programme participation, it seems to be reasonable alternatively to compare individuals with
different durations of training at the same point in time since they left the programme. This
ensures that participants with different durations of training have the same time to ﬁnd a job
after leaving the programme. Therefore, we additionally consider the probability of employment at the point in time 1 year after the participants exited the programme. Before presenting
results for the GPS, we explore ﬁrst the relationship between the post-treatment probability of
employment and the duration of treatment by using a probit model. Tables 2 and 3 investigate
the relationship between the probability of employment at 2 years after entering the programme
and 1 year after exit from the programme respectively, with the duration of treatment.

We report marginal effects instead of estimated coefﬁcients for our probit model to facilitate
understanding of the relationship between probability of employment and duration of treatment. First, Tables 2 and 3 show that there is a positive correlation between the probability
of employment and duration of treatment, and a negative correlation between the probability
of employment and the square of the duration of treatment with or without controlling for
additional variables. However, the estimated coefﬁcients of the duration of treatment are small,
and the explanatory power of the duration of treatment is low (see the low pseudo-R2 in panel
(a) of Tables 2 and 3). These suggest that the effect of duration of treatment on the probability of employment is small or negligible. Results from a linear probability model (which are

Evaluating Continuous Training Programmes

not reported here) are similar to those from the probit model. In Figs O5a–O6b in the on-line
appendix we report the effects from the cubic speciﬁcation of the probit models, which illustrate
the average response levels to the corresponding duration of treatment.
However, it is worth noting that a regression-type analysis such as the probit or linear probability models may rely on extrapolation, compare incomparable observations and have a greater
risk of misspecifying the model. All of these could potentially bias the estimates. Propensity score
methods can alleviate these potential problems to some extent. For a discussion of the advantages of matching methods compared with parametric regressions see for example Ho et al. (2007).
4.2. Weak unconfoundedness assumption
The GPS approach is based on weak unconfoundedness as an identifying assumption. The factors which the caseworker takes into account when assigning clients to a training programme
centre on the clients’ aptitude for a certain job and the likelihood of succeeding in a particular
training programme (Section 2). The information that the caseworker bases her decision on
is largely congruent with the information that is contained in our data, in particular previous
educational attainment and vocational education, and detailed labour market histories capturing all spells of employment and unemployment from the previous 4 years. Controlling for
these covariates, we are thus conﬁdent that the inﬂuence of any remaining unobserved factors
is negligible and the application of the GPS justiﬁed. Moreover, to investigate the concern that
duration of treatment may possibly be endogenous, Tables 4 and 5 report instrumental variables
estimates by using planned duration as instrumental variable. Comparing these instrumental
variable estimates with the ordinary least squares estimates based on actual durations (which are
not reported here), we ﬁnd that in 15 out of 16 speciﬁcations they are not signiﬁcantly different
(see the results of the Hausman test in Tables 4 and 5). This suggests that the actual duration
of training does not suffer strongly from endogeneity.
4.3. Generalized propensity score estimation, common support and covariate balance
Our implementation of the GPS follows the procedure that was outlined in Hirano and Imbens
(2004) and adapted to our context as presented in Section 3 above. We ﬁrst estimate the conditional distribution of the length of the training programme (treatment) by applying ordinary
least squares (the estimation results are reported in Table O1 in the on-line appendix). To test the
common support condition for the actual duration, following the approach that was outlined in
Section 3.3, we divide the sample into three groups, which are deﬁned by cutting the distribution
of treatment duration at the 30th and 70th percentiles. We then ﬁrst evaluate the GPS of the
whole sample at the median actual duration of treatment of group 1, i.e. 84 days. After that we
plot the distribution of this GPS (i.e. evaluated at the median actual duration of the ﬁrst group)
for group 1 and for the other two groups taken together: a procedure which results in Fig. 3(a).
We repeat the same procedure for group 2 and group 3, which gives us Figs 3(b) and 3(c). In the
second step we delete those individuals from our sample who fall outside the common support
region. For the actual duration we delete around 2% of our sample. The distributions for the
GPS after deleting the non-overlap are reported in Figs 3(d)–3(f) (corresponding common support graphs for planned duration of training and actual equal to planned duration are reported
in the on-line appendix).
To assess the balancing property of the GPS (see Section 3.3), we ﬁrst regress every observable
characteristic on the logarithm of the duration of training and compare the coefﬁcients for speciﬁcations without and with conditioning on the predicted individual duration E[T |Xi ]. The results
for the actual duration of training are reported in the ﬁrst four columns of numbers of Table 6.

Evaluating Continuous Training Programmes

605

Without conditioning on the predicted duration of training we observe many signiﬁcant coefﬁcients. For example, age is strongly and positively correlated with observed duration of training.
However, once we condition on E[T |Xi ], the coefﬁcient for age decreases from 1.17 to 0.11 and
is clearly insigniﬁcant. This also holds for previous employment outcomes, e.g. the negative
correlation between being employed 12 weeks before entering the programme decreases and
becomes insigniﬁcant. We do not observe any signiﬁcant correlations for the covariates once we
condition on E[T |Xi ] and the corresponding coefﬁcients clearly decrease, which indicates that
the GPS properly balances the observable characteristics in our sample.
If we compare the regressions of the covariates on the duration of training without and with
conditioning on the distribution of Ri , which are reported in the last four columns of Table 6, we
come to the same conclusion. All previously signiﬁcant coefﬁcients become insigniﬁcant once
we condition on Ri and the corresponding coefﬁcients clearly decrease. This picture is the same
for the sample with actual equal to planned duration (see Table O2 in the on-line appendix).
As an additional test for the balancing property of the GPS we apply the approach of blocking
on the score that was suggested by Hirano and Imbens (2004). For actual durations, group 1
includes individuals with a treatment level between 11 and 137 days, group 2 ranges from 138
to 247 days and group 3 from 248 to 395 days. For each of the covariates we test whether the
difference in means of one group compared with the other two groups is signiﬁcantly different. Without adjustment the clear majority of t-statistics are greater than 1.96, indicating a
clearly unbalanced distribution of covariates. In the second step, we calculate the corresponding
t-statistics for the GPS-adjusted sample. In contrast with the unadjusted sample, we observe no
t-statistics larger than 1.96 for both the actual duration and the sample with equal planned and
actual durations (reported in Tables O3 and O4 in the on-line appendix). These results indicate
that the balance of the covariates is clearly improved by adjustment for the GPS and conﬁrm
the results of the two other balancing tests.

4.4. Results from estimating the dose–response function
The ﬁnal step of our empirical analysis consists in estimating the GPS-adjusted dose–response
function. The estimation results of the dose–response function for actual duration of training
are reported in Table 7. The estimated coefﬁcients in the dose–response function have no direct
causal interpretation, and whether all the estimated coefﬁcients associated with the GPS terms
are equal to 0 can indicate whether the covariates introduce any bias, as stressed in Hirano
and Imbens (2004). We ﬁnd that, in the case of the outcome variable measured at 2 years after
entry into the programme, the coefﬁcients of the GPS terms are more signiﬁcant than in the
case of the outcome variable measured at 1 year after exit from the programme. This implies
for the former that it is more important to apply the GPS technique to remove potential bias
introduced by the covariates.
Our main results for both outcome variables are presented in Fig. 4 (probability of employment at time 2 years after entry into the programme) and Fig. 5 (probability of employment
at time 1 year after exit from the programme), where each ﬁgure consists of two parts showing
results for
(a) the actual duration and
(b) for the sample of individuals for which actual duration equals planned duration.
Figs 4 and 5 also include the counterfactual non-participant probability of employment baseline (estimated by using standard binary propensity score matching with a sample of nonparticipants), which indicates that training effects are generally positive. This ﬁnding is in line

†Source: integrated employment biographies of the German Federal Employment Agency.
The sample consists of male participants in training programmes in West Germany for the
years 2000–2002. The dependent variable is the probability of being employed 2 years after
entry into the programme (panel (a)) and 1 year after exit from the programme (panel (b)).
The duration in days is divided by 100. The coefﬁcients of the GPS are reported in Table O1
in the on-line appendix.

with Rinne et al. (2011), who implemented a binary treatment comparison training evaluation
also using the integrated employment biographies data.
Figs 4(a) and 5(a) show a similar shape for the dose–response function of the two employment
outcomes based on actual duration of training. Both graphs indicate a slowly and monotonously
increasing employment response to different levels of the treatment until around 240 days (i.e.
8 months). Although steadily increasing, the shape of the dose–response function is relatively
ﬂat and implies an increase in the post-training probability of employment of approximately
2 percentage points from a treatment dose of 50 days (employment response approximately 0.34)
to a treatment dose of 200 days (employment response approximately 0.36). The conﬁdence
bands, however, suggest that this increase might actually be zero. Durations of training that are
larger than 240 days do not seem to lead to a further increase in the probability of employment,
as indicated by the shape of the dose–response function and the conﬁdence bands.
Looking at the dose–response function of the sample of participants with equal actual and
planned durations of training, this pattern becomes more pronounced (Figs 4(b) and 5(b)). For

the employment outcome at time 2 years after entry into the programme in Fig. 4(b) there is a
clear indication that the increase in the probability of employment that is induced by the duration of treatment occurs mainly during approximately the ﬁrst 120 days. For longer durations
of training the dose–response function is ﬂat and no additional employment impulse seems to
be brought about by the treatment. Fig. 5(b) further conﬁrms this general pattern, pointing to
a core increase in the probability of employment for programmes up to 120–150 days and no
additional effect from a maximum of 200 days onwards (Figs O3 and O4 in the on-line appendix
show very similar dose–response functions for planned duration of training).
In addition to the graphs displaying the dose–response function we calculate the pairwise
differences in probabilities of employment between different durations of training and bootstrap standard errors from 2000 replications. For example, we calculate the difference in our
outcome variables between 18 days of training and 39 days of training, between 18 days of training and 60 days of training etc. This allows us to test whether the effect of different durations
of training is signiﬁcantly different from zero.
Table 8 shows, for example, that for participants with actual equal to planned duration the
difference in the probability of employment at time 2 years after entry into the programme
between a duration of 18 days and a duration of 102 days is signiﬁcant at the 10% level. The
point estimate suggests an increase of around 15 percentage points (pairwise comparisons of
alternative speciﬁcations, i.e. for actual durations of training and for the second outcome, are
reported in the on-line appendix, Tables O5–O7). If we compare the durations of training
of 102 days and 60 days, the estimates indicate an increased probability of employment by
5.6 percentage points, which is signiﬁcantly different from zero at the 5% level. Comparing the
employment effect of training of around 100 days with training of around 300 days indicates a
small and insigniﬁcant difference. However, for treatment effects 1 year after exit, we do not ﬁnd
signiﬁcant differences between the different levels of intensity of treatment. Similarly, for the
actual duration of training the differential duration impacts also remain largely insigniﬁcant,
as indicated by the conﬁdence bands in Figs 4(a) and 5(a).
In sum, the GPS-adjusted analysis of the relationship between a continuous training programme and the corresponding probability of employment of participants thus shows a very
interesting pattern. Whereas during the ﬁrst 100–150 days of exposure to treatment increasing
the dose yields increasing returns in terms of employment prospects 2 years after entry into the
programme, further increasing the dose beyond 150 days appears to bring about no additional
treatment effect, i.e. the human capital enhancing features of training are effective during the
beginning period (i.e. the initial doses work), but effectiveness fades out after a maximum of
approximately 5 months of participation. The initial increase in the probability of employment
is much less pronounced for the actual duration of training (Figs 4(a) and 5(a)). This result
may be driven by individuals who leave the programme early because they received a job offer.
Controlling for early exits by using the sample with planned equal to actual durations leads to
estimating a positive effect of approximately the ﬁrst 120 days of duration of training.
These ﬁndings add interesting additional insights into the effectiveness of training programmes for the unemployed in Germany. There are several references analysing effect heterogeneity of training programmes with respect to observable characteristics; see for example Rinne
et al. (2011). They found only weak evidence for heterogeneous effects with respect to level of
skill and age. Other research exploits the difference of long versus short training programmes
by discretizing the length of training; see for example Lechner et al. (2011). They show that
longer programmes have a larger and more sustainable positive effect on subsequent prospects
for employment. However, in their case the longer duration goes along with a different type
of programme—substantive training programmes leading to a vocational degree are compared

†Source: integrated employment biographies of the German Federal Employment Agency. The column headings
are durations of training. Table entries are differences in treatment effects from the duration in the ﬁrst column
compared with treatment effects from the duration in the column headings. Treatment effects are based on the

with shorter programmes not leading to a degree. In this paper, we use the GPS framework to
exploit the effect heterogeneity of different levels of duration of training within the same types
of programme. Our results suggest that an increased duration of training does not automatically go along with higher subsequent probabilities of employment, and that, after a maximum
of around 5 months of training, additional time spent in programmes does not have an effect
on subsequent prospects for employment. These results indicate that learning speciﬁc skills required for a certain vocation or receiving qualiﬁcations that are of general vocational use—i.e.
the contents of the programmes that were analysed here—have positive expected returns only
up to a certain duration.

Robustness

In this section, we carry out sensitivity checks for our main speciﬁcation. Some of the individuals in our sample participate in more than one training programme during their spell of
unemployment. Since we consider the duration of the ﬁrst training programme as the treatment
dose, this might not reﬂect the ‘true’ treatment dose for every unemployed individual in our
sample. Therefore the ﬁrst check is that we restrict our sample to the people who went through a
training programme exactly once. In the second check, we try various speciﬁcations for the dose–
response functions to investigate whether our results are sensitive to the speciﬁcation that we
apply, which includes different degrees of polynomial speciﬁcations and ﬂexible spline models
to check the functional form speciﬁcations.

Figs 4 and 5 above also include dose–response functions for a subsample of our data (labelled
‘dose–response for subsample’ in the graphs). The original data contain information on whether
a training participant, after having taken part in the course which we analyse here, participated
in another training course at some point in time. These are about 7% of individuals in our sample. We therefore include results for the subsample of observations that participated in exactly
the one course for which we have data on planned and actual durations. Regarding the balancing
of covariates and the shape of the dose–response functions, results for the subsample are very
similar to those for the full sample.
Our main impact estimates are based on a cubic speciﬁcation for the dose–response function. We also estimate results for the dose–response function for the full sample for quadratic
and fourth-degree polynomial speciﬁcations as well (see the on-line appendix, Figs O5a,b and
O6a,b). These results show that the general shapes and trends of the dose–response functions
remain relatively unchanged under different speciﬁcations, though there are some differences in
detail. Our central ﬁnding that the main body of the dose–response functions is rather ﬂat, i.e.
longer training programmes do not seem to add an additional treatment effect, is robust. This
main result holds true also if we use the logarithm of the duration as the dependent variable for
our GPS (see the thin lines in the on-line appendix ﬁgures).
Besides experimenting with different degrees of polynomial speciﬁcations, we also apply spline
models to check the robustness of our results with respect to functional assumptions in our main
models. Similarly to a non-parametric regression, which requires the researcher to make decisions regarding for example the type of kernel and proper bandwidth, in the spline models we
need to choose the type of the spline, the number of knots and the position of the knots. Among
them, the number of knots is the most important; see Keele (2008). Figs 6 and 7 present results
from the spline models based on B-splines with 12 knots for the speciﬁcation based on actual
duration. The results are very similar to the results from our main models. The only difference

that we observe compared with our main speciﬁcation is that the results based on the spline
model for the outcome at time 2 years after entry into a programme indicate a positive increase
from around 50 days to around 100 days of training. However, this positive increase is in line
with the results based on the sample of participants for which the actual duration equals the
planned duration.
As mentioned earlier, the number of knots is important in the spline models; just like the
bandwidth, it controls the smoothness of the ﬁtting. Therefore we varied the number of knots
from 6 to 12, and the results are quite similar except at the tails.

Conclusion

In this paper, we study the effect of the duration of training programmes on the post-treatment
probability of employment, using a particular data set that contains information on duration of
training in days for a period of from about 1 week to 13 months. In particular, we are interested in
estimating the dose–response function at all possible durations of treatment. We implement this
using the recently developed GPS for continuous treatments. Extensive diagnostics on covariate
balance, common support and the weak unconfoundedness assumption validate the approach.
Moreover, we can consider both the planned and the actual durations as treatment variables,
thus avoiding a potential bias in estimating the dose–response function from endogenous exits,
which may play a role if only actual durations are observed. We conduct various checks of
robustness to solidify our results further.
Our ﬁndings indicate that the dose–response function that relates duration of training to the
corresponding probability of employment has a relatively ﬂat shape after an initial increase
during the ﬁrst 120 days of training. Indeed, the ﬁrst 3–5 months of a training programme
appear to be the most effective period to improve the probability of employment and to bring
about the generally positive effect relative to the non-participant baseline. In the lower segment

616

of the distribution of durations of training, additional doses seem to bring about increases in
post-training employment prospects.
After approximately 150 days, however, further participation in the programme does not
seem to lead to an increase in the treatment effect, as the dose–response function is basically
ﬂat for higher doses. Whether the effect actually even starts to decrease again for the very long
durations (longer than 300 days) cannot be said with certainty, as large conﬁdence bands due
to a small number of observations exacerbate a precise estimation of this effect. On the basis
of our assessment of the dynamics of the individual probability of employment brought about
by continuous increases in duration of programmes, there seems to be little justiﬁcation for
training programmes in Germany to last longer than a maximum of about 3–5 months. This
conclusion holds for the type of programmes that was analysed in this study, i.e. for training
programmes which do not lead to a vocational degree. There is evidence that substantive training
programmes with a duration of 2 years and leading to a vocational degree have a large positive
effect on subsequent employment outcomes (Lechner et al., 2011).
