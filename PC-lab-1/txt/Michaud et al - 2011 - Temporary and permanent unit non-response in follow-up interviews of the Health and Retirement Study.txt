ABSTRACT
Effects of Attrition and Non-Response
in the Health and Retirement Study
We study the effect of attrition and other forms of non-response on the representativity over
time of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) sample born 1931-1941; the sample was
initially drawn in 1992. Although some baseline characteristics of respondents do appear
correlated with non-response over time, the 2002 sample of respondents does not appear to
suffer significantly from selection on observables, except for race and ethnicity; for these two
observables, longitudinal weights based on the Current Population Survey (CPS) can be
used and are provided with the data set. We attribute this lack of selection to the fact that
attritors who differ most eventually come back to the survey in waves prior to 2002. Although
this allows cross-sections to remain fairly representative in later waves, it suggests that
longitudinal analysis should use the unbalanced sample rather than the balanced sample of
those interviewed in all waves. Individuals who attrit but who are recruited back into the
survey are very different from those who are permanent attritors to the HRS. Finally, we
investigate the selective nature of the decision of respondents to grant HRS permission to
access their Social Security records and of the non-response introduced by employers of
pension policyholders not providing HRS with worker’s Summary Plan Descriptions. We find
that subsamples for which such information is available are selective on a number of
dimensions, such as education and other socioeconomic status (SES) outcomes.

1. Introduction
Longitudinal surveys such as the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) provide a
rich source of information to study the evolution of various socioeconomic and health
outcomes of a population of interest. However, as in any panel survey, a major potential
weakness is that some respondents drop out over time, and when their characteristics are
different from those in the retention sample, the representativity of the sample
deteriorates, which may invalidate inferences drawn for the population of interest.
The original cohort entering the HRS study in 1992 was composed of individuals
born between 1931 and 1941 and their spouses, irrespective of their age. The next year, a
much older cohort was interviewed, the Study of Assets and Health Dynamics among the
Oldest Old (AHEAD) cohort, which was born before 1923. Both these cohorts have been
followed every two years up through 2006.1 In 1998, two new cohorts were added and
blended into the original sample, the so-called Child of the Depression Age Cohort
(CODA), born between 1924 and 1930, and the War Babies cohort, born between 1942
and 1947. Every wave sees some respondents leave the study. Hence, it is important to
know if the sample in recent waves remains a random sample from the population age
55+ in the United States.
We are not aware of studies that have looked closely at how problems related to
attrition affect the representativity of the HRS. In the case where attrition is a problem, it
is important to develop tools that researchers can use to deal with such problems and get
a sense of which analyses are more likely than others to be affected by attrition. In this
study, we look at the effects of attrition from 1992 to 2002 for the original cohort born
1931–1941. We choose to work with this cohort because it has been in the study for the
longest time and is, therefore, the most likely cohort, along with AHEAD, to have
suffered from non-random attrition.
We also investigate the selective nature of two other aspects of the HRS. First,
HRS seeks consent from respondents to merge their Social Security record from SSA.
Although the consent rate is high, there remains the possibility that those refusing the
match may be different from those giving consent.2 The same holds true for Summary
Plan Descriptions (SPD) of pension plan holders that HRS requests from employers. The
information contained in such records is widely used by researchers. Hence, we also
investigate the selective nature of restricting the sample to respondents with a match.
We should make clear that attrition can have effects on some analyses and not on
others. This will depend on several dimensions of the analysis, such as whether the
analysis intends to look at a cross-section in a given year or intends to follow respondents
over time to learn about some pattern of behavior, the outcome of interest being
estimated, and the specific model (particularly conditioning variables) one is considering.
Effects of attrition can result from selection on observable or unobservable
characteristics. Our analysis will focus mostly on the effect of attrition from selection on
observables on cross-sectional comparisons. As for longitudinal analysis, we will
investigate the dynamic nature over waves of participation and mortality in the HRS. This
will be informative about likely effects on longitudinal analysis.

The AHEAD cohort is interviewed in 1993, 1995 and then merged with the main study for 1998 onwards.
Olson (1999) and Haider and Solon (2000) also investigate the representativity of the SSA record match.

Section 2 presents data about participation and vital status in the original HRS
cohort over waves. Section 3 presents a statistical model of attrition and an analysis of the
determinants of attrition and mortality. Section 4 investigates whether the match outcome
for Social Security records and Summary Plan Descriptions for pension holders is
random. Section 5 presents the impact of non-random attrition on some cross-sectional
tabulations of interest using inverse probability weighting based on estimates from
Section 3. Finally, Section 6 concludes.

2. The HRS Cohort 1931–1941
The target population of the original HRS cohort is households where at least one
member was born between 1931 and 1941. The sample is drawn using a multistage area
probability sample of households and an interview is attempted with all age-eligible
respondents and their spouses. Only non-institutionalized individuals are considered at
baseline, although the HRS follows respondents entering nursing homes in later waves.
The Institute for Social Research (ISR) in Michigan conducts the survey.
The HRS has three supplements that over-sample respondents from certain
groups. These supplements consist of a 2:1 over-sample of African Americans,
Hispanics, and Floridians. Of the 15,497 interviews attempted, 12,654 were realized. This
yields an overall individual response rate of 81.6% at baseline. The response rate is very
similar for the main study and the African American (81.1%) and Floridian (82.2%)
samples, but the rate is lower for the Hispanic supplement (77%).

hfyle=design&xtyp=2. These numbers refer to all respondents and their spouses who
can be born before 1931 or after 1941.

We focus our analysis on respondents born between 1931 and 1941. These
respondents are age 51 to 61 in 1992 and 61 to 71 in 2002. These sample selection
criteria imply that the sample in 1992 is composed of 10,069 respondents.
An issue with any survey, longitudinal or not, is whether respondents who
decided to participate at baseline are representative of the population of interest.
Answering this question is inherently difficult because characteristics of those who did
not participate are unknown. This is unlike attrition, where at least baseline
characteristics are available for the group who will not respond in later waves.
3

Hence, we must resort to a comparison with an external dataset to measure the
extent of non-randomness from non-response. Other studies, such as the Current
Population Survey (CPS,) also suffer from non-response.3 This implies that even if the
composition of the CPS and HRS sample is different, it may be complicated to interpret
different statistics across surveys. One example is household wealth, where it has been
established that neither CPS or HRS is representative of the high end of the wealth
distribution (Juster, Smith, and Stafford, 1999). Because the HRS does not capture the
top few percent of the wealth distribution, it, like all household surveys, will not match
mean population wealth well.
The HRS is different from the CPS along certain recognized dimensions. The
HRS dataset contains weights that match cell frequencies in the CPS defined by race and
ethnicity, birth cohort, and gender at baseline. This corrects for the HRS over-sampling
design and for differential unit non-response across these groups. Beyond these
characteristics, it is still difficult to compare the CPS and the HRS at baseline because
differences in computed statistics from each dataset can and sometimes are the result of
question wording differences. One important example is that because of changes in
question wording over time, CPS and HRS incomes no longer match well. (see Banks,
Marmot, Oldfield, and Smith, 2006).
Nevertheless, some evidence is presented in Table 2.2 showing that the samples
are quite similar in terms of some measures that are comparable across the two surveys
(HRS and CPS) for respondents age 51-61: educational attainment, marital status, and
labor force participation.

Respondents are age 51–61.

Because the HRS is a study of a near-elderly population, it emphasizes tracking
the vital status of respondents over waves, shown in Table 2.3. Deaths are reported by
relatives contacted by an interviewer. Respondents are presumed alive when they cannot

information can be obtained, vital status is coded as unknown.

Notes: A respondent is presumed alive if the interviewer cannot reach a respondent but has access to some
information that the respondent might be alive. If no such information can be obtained, the respondent's vital status is
classified as unknown. Mortality rate is calculated as a fraction of alive or presumed alive respondents at previous
wave. The cumulative mortality rate is calculated as the fraction of 1992 respondents known to be alive.

As shown in the table, the mortality rate grows from 1.7% in the second wave to
4% in 2002 as the cohort ages. The unweighted cumulative mortality rate over all waves
is 12%. A back-of-the-envelope calculation using SSA life table mortality rates for an
individual age 55 (the mid-point age in 1992) yields a cumulative mortality rate of 11.8%
(gender weighted using fraction of males in the sample) over this 10-year period. If we
weight HRS deaths to correct for the over-sampling of African Americans and Hispanics
(as well as Floridians), we obtain a cumulative mortality rate of 11.3%. Therefore, the
HRS tracks the deceased reasonably well.
The ISR attempts two types of interviews depending on the vital status of the
respondent. In the event where death is reported, an exit interview rather than a core
interview is attempted. The exit interview is most often accomplished with the widow(er)
or with another close relative of the deceased respondent. It is in general shorter than the
core interview.
Table 2.4 reports that in 1992, 152 core interviews are missing and 156 are not in
the sample for that wave. The first 152 are absent age-eligible spouses who do not
provide an interview at baseline. These last 156 respondents are future spouses of ageeligible HRS respondents.4 In general, the response rate on core interviews is higher in all
subsequent waves, although there is a small downward time trend (90.5% in 1994 versus
87.3% in 2002, see Table 2.4).
The response rate on exit interviews is generally lower than on core interviews,
perhaps because relatives are less inclined to participate in a survey asking about the
deceased. Once exit interviews are completed, a respondent is classified as out-of sample.
Other reasons for exclusion from the sample include an explicit request by the respondent
to be removed from the study. By 2002, 11.5% of original respondents are considered
out-of-sample. Table A.1 in the appendix gives a breakdown of all interview/sample
membership and vital status found in the HRS.
4

We calculated the overall response rate in 1992 as the product of the response rate for age-eligible
respondents and their spouse (81.6%), and the response rate is conditional on being considered in sample in
1992 (98.5%). 15,497 interviews were attempted in 1992, of which 12,654 were completed. But this
includes the spouses of age-eligible respondents who were born before 1931 or after 1941. Hence, we do
not know the number of attempted interviews on individuals born between 1931 and 1941.

Notes: Calculated from frequencies in Table A.1. Exit interviews include post-exit interviews, while out-of- sample
includes non-eligible spouses that become eligible at a later wave, those who are permanently dropped from the
sample (at their request or from HRS decision,) and respondents that are dead and for whom an exit or post-exit
interview was completed. For 1992, the response rate does not take account of the initial round of non-response,
as shown in Table 2.1. Since we do not include spouses born before 1931 or after 1941 in the analysis, the
number of respondents interviewed at baseline will differ from what is shown in Table 2.1

Interviewers re-contact every respondent who did not provide a core interview in
the previous wave but is considered to be part of the sample. (This excludes baseline nonrespondents.) Each participant gets $20 for an interview.5 As a result of re-contacts,
participation patterns in the HRS are considerably diverse. Figure 2.1 shows the various
flows of entry and exit across years. The traditional exit routes are mortality and what is
commonly defined as attrition, or non-response, in a given wave conditional on providing
an interview in a previous wave. For example, of the 9761 respondents who provided
core interviews in 1992, 167 (1.7%) were reported dead the following wave, and 788
(8.1%) were missing because they could not be reached or they refused to provide an
interview. In 2002, only 5% of respondents take this last route. This pattern most likely
reflects heterogeneity in terms of general willingness to participate in surveys, since those
with a lower relative willingness to participate will have left in earlier waves.
There is also entry of previously interviewed respondents who may have skipped
an interview. Starting in 1996, between 26.8% and 44.3% of respondents with missing
interviews come back to the panel to provide a core interview. This last feature of
participation sequences can be of major importance for the representativity of the HRS
sample over time. It may help to keep cumulative attrition down compared to other
surveys that might not attempt to re-contact respondents missing in a given wave. If these
respondents coming back are also those with different characteristics, this can also
attenuate the attrition bias in inferences on cross-sections. It also shows that an analysis
of attrition in the HRS should not consider non-response as an absorbing state.
Given that a fraction of respondents are not re-interviewed in later waves, one
might ask if the remaining sample from the population remains representative over time.
5

IRS also experimented with randomized “end games” for a subset of respondents classified “hard refusal.”
The reward for participation in such games can reach up to $100 and is reported in Hill and Willis (2001) to
have some effect on participation. A similar experiment was accomplished in 2000. Rodgers (2006) reports
strong participation effects for re-contacts of participates who did not provide an interview at the last wave.

6

If those leaving the panel in the left branch of Figure 2.1 have systematically different
characteristics, measured and unmeasured, this will distort the view of the population of
interest that one draws from the sample of HRS respondents.
Using baseline weights that match the CPS on birth cohort, race, ethnicity and
gender will restore the representativity of the sample if attrition is totally random. If
attrition is only determined by the same factors that go in the construction of weights that
match the CPS in later years (race and ethnicity, household composition, birth cohort, and
gender), yearly CPS weights will also restore the representativity of the sample so that
inferences on each cross-section should not suffer from any bias from attrition. But the
issue of importance is to see if attrition is determined by additional factors not captured in
the CPS weights. In such a case, the representativity of the HRS would deteriorate over
the years and HRS-provided weights would not correct entirely for the loss of
representativity. This could lead to biased inference on the population of interest. We
formalize these concepts in the next section and investigate what are the factors that may
drive attrition.

3. Attrition and Mortality
To adopt a precise definition of attrition and the context in which it may matter,
we consider a simplified two-period longitudinal survey. In the first period, assume a
representative sample of size N is drawn from the population of interest. The information
gathered consists of ( yi 0 , zi ) where yi 0 is some outcome of interest and zi are other
characteristics of respondents. This information is gathered for every respondent at
baseline. Assume that every respondent survives to the second period.
In the second period, denote by si = (0,1) an indicator for whether or not the
respondent provides information on yi1 . Some respondents will not provide an interview
in the second period and are coded as attritors ( si = 0 ). However, they remain part of the
population of interest. The question is whether the selected sample for which yi1 is
observed ( si = 1 ) remains representative for the population of interest and, if not, how
this affects inference on some feature (e.g. mean) of the population distribution of
( yi1 , zi ) .
3.1.1 Selection on Observables and Weighting
Suppose we are interested in estimating the mean of yi in the second period, E ( yi1 ) .
Since we can only use the retention sample, what we can estimate consistently is
E ( yi1 | si = 1) . A sufficient assumption for E ( yi1 ) = E ( yi1 | si = 1) is that yi1 is independent
of si . This assumption may be too strong. For example, some characteristics zi may
affect yi1 as well as si . They may drive the costs and benefits a respondent could derive
from an interview, thus affecting the decision to participate (Hill and Willis, 2001). This
assumption is known as missing completely at random (MCAR, see Rubin and Little,
1987). If correct, it allows to consistently estimate the quantity of interest from the
retention sample without any corrections. A less restrictive assumption is the assumption
missing at random (MAR, see Little and Rubin, 1987) or selection on observables
(Fitzgerald et al., 1998):
MAR x : yi1 ⊥ si | xi

(1)

The symbol ⊥ denotes independence (conditional on xi ). Here xi may contain time
invariant characteristics zi observed at baseline but may also contain period 1 outcomes
( xi = ( zi , yi 0 ) ). Denote the retention probability (the probability that si = 1 ) conditional
on xi as p ( si | xi ) . Thus individuals with different characteristics and baseline outcomes
can have different probabilities of staying in the survey in the second period. Under the
missing at random assumption it may well be the case that E ( yi1 ) ≠ E ( yi1 | si = 1) . It can
be easily shown, however, that if MAR holds
E(

si
yi1 ) = E ( yi1 ) .
p ( si | xi )

9

(2)

Hence weighting can be used to get consistent estimates, with the weight for each
respondent given by the inverse of the retention probability p ( si | xi ) .
Two types of weights can be constructed: frequency weights and inverse
probability weights. Frequency weights are provided with the HRS dataset for each wave.
We refer to these weights as the HRS weights. These weights use the ratio of the sample
size in a given year for the CPS (a cross-section) and HRS in cells defined by gender,
race, household composition and birth cohort. Hence weights are a function w(qi ) where
qi has gender, race, household composition and birth cohort. These weights are adjusted
each wave (using the CPS March Supplement of the corresponding year) and hence
account for attrition under the assumptions that attrition or selection play no role in the
CPS and that attrition in the HRS is MAR with xi = qi :
MARq : yi1 ⊥ si | qi .
(3)
This assumption is still rather restrictive since there may well be other variables not
included in qi that affect both response behavior and the variable of interest.
Alternatively, a set of weights can be constructed from (2) using an expanded set
of characteristics xi (containing qi ) observed in one or more earlier waves of the HRS.
Estimating p ( si | xi ) is straightforward using, for example, a logit or probit model. Under
the assumption MARx, “inverse probability weights” (IPW) can be constructed (Horvitz
and Thomson, 1952; Horowitz and Manski, 1998; Wooldridge, 2003), given by
IPW : w( xi ) =

1
p ( si | xi )

(4)

HRS weights and IPW weights should have the same effect on the estimates of quantities
of interest if the MAR assumption also holds conditional on qi .
Our strategy will be to first investigate how p ( si | xi ) depends on a large set of
time invariant characteristics and baseline outcomes xi . Indeed, we can check if
p ( si | xi ) = p ( si | qi ) . If it does, i.e., observed baseline characteristics other than race,
ethnicity, household composition, birth cohort and gender do not explain attrition, then
HRS weights are enough to correct for selection (under the maintained assumption
MARx). If baseline characteristics other than those in qi predict attrition, we will analyze
how using inverse probability weights based upon a full set of characteristics xi gives
different tabulations than when using HRS weights based upon qi . The difference
between the two tabulations will provide a measure of how selection on observables not
in qi affects tabulations of interest.
3.1.2 Selection on Unobservables
The MAR assumption will be violated if there are unobserved variables that are
correlated with both yi1 and si conditional on xi . Many selection models have been
developed in the literature to deal with this case. A seminal example is Hausman and
10

Wise (1979).6 All these models require exclusion restrictions for nonparametric
identification – variables that drive attrition but have no effect on the variable of interest.
Fitzgerald et al. (1998) point out that in the case of attrition it is virtually impossible to
find plausible exclusion restrictions. Both respondent and interviewer characteristics are
likely to be correlated with the outcome of interest.7 In general the two assumptions
(MAR and HW) are undistinguishable unless additional information is used. Hirano et al.
(2001) propose using refreshment samples to distinguish between the two assumptions.
They find support for the MAR assumption in a Dutch dataset on travel behavior.
Because of the identification problems and the experience in the recent panel data
literature, we do not explore selection on unobservables in this study and focus on
correcting for selection on a rich set of observables.
3.2 Baseline Determinants of Attrition
We first study the determinants of attrition in the HRS by looking at how baseline
(1992) characteristics of respondents correlate with whether they are still alive and
provided an interview in 2002. This is informative if one intends to analyze the evolution
of the 1931–1941 birth cohort from 1992 until 2002. We define four types of
participation sequences from 1992 to 2002.
First, 64.3% of the 1992 respondents provide core interviews in all six waves
from 1992 to 2002 (the always in group). Second, as seen in Figure 2.1, there is a
sizeable fraction of respondents (8.9%) who respond in both 1992 and 2002 but who do
not respond in at least one intermediate wave. We refer to these as ever out. The last two
groups are respondents who are not interviewed in 2002. 12.1% of respondents die prior
to interview in 2002. Finally, 14.7% of the 1992 respondents are not interviewed in 2002
for other reasons than death. We refer to them as attritors. These would fit under the
traditional definition of attrition (although some of them may come back in 2004 or
later).
Mortality does not affect the representativity of a sample over time in a crosssectional sense, since the relevant population in a given year is that of the survivors.
However, longitudinal analysis at the individual level may be contaminated by
composition effects from mortality. For example, mortality might bias the estimates of
the aggregate age trend of wealth holdings because of the well-known positive correlation
between health and wealth (see, e.g. Attanasio and Hoynes, 2000). This makes it
important to consider mortality as an alternative exit route in the analysis. However, our
main focus is on non-response and its effect on inferences from the retention sample,
particularly in 2002.
In Table 3.1, we present baseline characteristics of respondents who gave an
interview in 1992 by type of participation over the 1992–2002 period. First, it is obvious
that characteristics associated with mortality reflect the well-known relation between
health and socioeconomic status (SES). Older individuals, African-Americans, Hispanics,
unhealthy, and less educated respondents are more likely to die over the 10-year period. It
turns out that the attritors group has an overrepresentation of individuals born outside the

An example of an application of a selection model to attrition in the PSID is given by Lillard and Panis
(1998).

United States, Hispanics, and to a lesser-extent African-Americans. However, along most
attributes, the attritors are not very different from respondents interviewed in all waves in
terms of education, marital status, and labor force participation status.
Rather, it is respondents who are ever out but present in 2002 who are quite
different from respondents who answer in all waves. They are more likely to have
experienced a divorce (37.3% versus 30.4%), and far more likely to be African-American
(14.9 versus 8.7%) or Hispanic (13.4 versus 5.4%). They are generally less educated
(16.6 versus 20.5% with college or above) and less likely to be retired or disabled (10.7
versus 15.5%). One can think of this sub-sample as the temporary attritors, and this group
appears to be highly selective on observables.

Notes: See appendix for variable definitions. “Always in”: respondents who provide core interviews in all 6
waves between 1992 and 2002. “Ever out”: respondents who provide core interviews in 1992 and 2002 but
have skipped one or more interviews in intermediate waves. “Died”: Respondents in 1992 who died before
2002. Attritors: respondents not in the HRS in 2002. HRS 1992 weights used.

These statistics suggest that respondents “ever out” are far more different from
those “always in” than they are from the “attritors.” In fact, attritors are closer to
12

respondents answering in all waves then to those ever out. We find qualitatively similar
but quantitatively larger differences between the four groups when looking at the
distribution of household wealth, income, and individual earnings in 1992 (Table 3.2).

For those who eventually die, the full extent of the SES-health gradient can be
seen. Median wealth in 1992 is half that of those always in ($77,329 versus $143,484).
Again, respondents ever out but present in 2002 are far more different from those always
in than from attritors. For example, median wealth is $94,898 for those ever out
compared to $143,484 for those always in and $141,064 for attritors. Differences in
wealth for ever out are partly (but not all) explained by lower home ownership (73%
versus 83.9% for those always in, own a house). In relative terms, differences are larger
at the bottom of the distribution than at the top (90th percentile), suggesting that the
selection effect originates from the lower end of the distributions. Finally, differences in
earnings (conditional on positive earnings) are far smaller than those in household
income or wealth.
Since none of these comparisons takes account of the correlation among
characteristics, we estimate a multinomial logit explaining the type of response behavior
from baseline characteristics of respondents interviewed in 1992. Define indicators
s ij ( j = a , e , d , o ) denoting whether respondent i has been always in, ever out, died or
was out in 2002 (i.e. attritors) . The probability of each outcome is modeled as
P( sij = 1| xi 0 ) =

exp( xi 0 β j )

∑

13

j'

exp( xi 0 β j ' )

(6)

The vector xi 0 stands for the vector of baseline characteristics and the β s are
parameters to be estimated. Tables 3.3 and 3.4 present parameter estimates of these
multinomial logits (with always in as the reference category, i.e., βa=0) for females and
males separately. We include basic demographics, health indicators, and quintile
indicators for the distributions of wealth, household income, and earnings. By doing the
latter, we allow for non-linearities in the effect of these variables on attrition and
mortality. Table A.2 in the appendix gives more details on the construction of the
explanatory variables.

Notes: Multinomial logit point estimates. ** p-value<0.01, * p-value<0.05. The dependent
variable is the type of participation. Covariates refer to baseline characteristics of
respondents in 1992. The reference category is always in; ever out refers to respondents
with core interviews in 1992 and 2002 but not in at least one wave between 1992 and 2002.
Census division dummies are included in the estimation, but these estimates are not
reported.

The effect of race and schooling on the probability a respondent is ever out or is
not present in 2002 is significant for both males and females. Hispanics, in particular,
appear to have higher non-response probabilities. As for African Americans, only males
appear to have a higher propensity to quit the panel. Respondents who were not born in
the United States are also more likely to quit the panel. One plausible conjecture is that
this results from return migration. We have also included census division indicators to
control for unexplained differences across regions of the country (coefficients not
reported). These are jointly significant for both males and females in the attrition
equation (females Chi-sq (8) = 41.4, males Chi-sq (8) = 16.4). These differences can
either be explained by regional factors affecting response probabilities, such as the fact
that residency in some states is seasonal (e.g., “snow-birds” in Florida), or by survey
administration differences across regions. This last possibility is mitigated by the fact that
the survey is centrally coordinated in Michigan. Census divisions such as South-Atlantic,
which includes Florida, have higher fractions of attritors and ever out respondents than
northern and western regions. This is in line with the “snow-bird hypothesis.”
Respondents in the lowest wealth quintile appear to have a greater probability of
leaving the panel and coming back. However, likelihood ratio tests of the null hypothesis
of no effect of income, wealth, and earnings in the attritor equation cannot reject this joint
hypothesis at any conventional significance level. The lack of a link between attrition and
baseline wealth, income, and earnings is in line with results from the PSID reported in
Fitzgerald et al. (1998).8 Unconditional differences in Table 3.2 appear to be largely the
result of other differences, most notably race and ethnicity. However, the link with
income and wealth is much stronger for mortality, even conditional on a rich set of
controls for baseline health. Joint tests looking at the null that there are no SES effects on
mortality reject this hypothesis for both males and females.

Fitzgerald et al. (1998) report differences in terms of labor income, which are usually only statistically
different from zero at the 10% level. They use a quadratic function of labor income, which may be more
sensitive to outliers than our quintile indicators.

Notes: Multinomial logit estimates ; ** p-value<0.01, * p-value<0.05. The dependent variable is
the type of response behavior. Covariates refer to characteristics of respondents in 1992. The
reference category is always in; ever out refers to respondents providing core interviews in 1992
and 2002 but not in at least one wave between 1992 and 2002. Census division dummies are
included, but these estimates are not reported.

3.3 Wave-by-Wave Determinants of Attrition
Attrition can also be driven by events that occur after the 1992 interview. Baseline
controls are imperfect proxies of the likelihood of such events. (An unhealthy person at
baseline is more likely to suffer a major health event that may cause non-response.) One
advantage of moving toward a longitudinal model to explain attrition is that this may
better capture events between waves that actually trigger attrition.
We therefore perform a multinomial logit regression of current wave status
(provided interview, reported dead, or attrited) conditional on providing a core interview
in the previous wave and on previous wave, as well as baseline (1992), characteristics.
16

The multinomial logit thus becomes a discrete time competing risk model. The two risks
are attrition and mortality.
Given the features of participation transitions observed in Figure 2.1, it would in
principle be possible to model reentry into the survey. However, this would be
complicated by the fact that previous wave characteristics are not observed when a
respondent reenters. Instead, we consider only the pairs of observations at wave t–1 and
wave t where the respondent responds in wave t-1. Thus, a respondent who does not
answer in 1994 but answers in every other wave will be included in the estimation for the
years t=1994, t=1998, t=2000 and t=2002, but not for t=1996.
Let the indicators sit , j ( j = p, d , n) denote respondents who participate in the
survey in wave t, died between wave t-1 and t, or did not respond in year t, respectively.
The probability of each state is assumed to be given by the multinomial logit expression
P( sit , j = 1| xit −1, xi 0 , sit −1, p = 1) =

exp( xi 0 β j + xit −1γ j + λtj )

∑

(7)

exp( xi 0 β j ' + xit −1γ j ' + λtj ' )
j'

We correct standard errors for the clustering introduced by considering multiple
occurrences of the same respondent in the likelihood. Also, year effects λtj are
introduced to capture duration dependence or calendar time effects. Baseline
characteristics are included in addition to previous wave characteristics to control for
time-invariant heterogeneity. The included previous wave characteristics are indicators
for whether the individual was divorced or widowed, various health indicators, an
indicator for whether the respondent was working for pay, and wealth, earnings and
household income. We consider participation in the survey as the reference outcome.
Respondents who do not respond in a wave are denoted as having “attrited,” although
they might come back to the survey in later waves.

Notes: Multinomial logit point estimates, ** p-value<0.01, * p-value<0.05. The dependent variable is the
state in a given wave (provided core interview, died or unknown status). Estimation is done conditional on
providing a core interview at the last wave. Both baseline and time-changing characteristics are included in
the estimation. A respondent can appear more than once in the estimation. Standard errors are corrected for
clustering at the respondent level. Census division and year dummies are included in the estimation but the
estimates are not reported.

Estimation results in Table 3.5 show that previous wave information is
informative about current wave status for both mortality and attrition. As expected,
mortality is closely related to previous wave health events. Interestingly, for males, it is
also related to previous wave wealth, confirming differential mortality across SES groups
as found by, for example, Attanasio and Hoynes, 2000.

18

As for attrition, the onset of “mild” health problems (such as diabetes,
hypertension, or mental health problems) and severe problems (heart and lung disease,
stroke) are significantly positively associated with attrition for males. For females, the
effects are in the same direction, but are not statistically significant, possibly because of
the lower number of observations for females. For females, the onset of a limitation in
performing daily activities is found to have a negative effect on attrition. If attrition is
positively related to mobility, limitations with activities of daily living (ADLs) may
indicate restricted mobility, increasing the chances that interviewers can contact the
respondent.
Divorce status in the previous wave is positively associated with attrition for
males but not for females. A similar result was found in the PSID (Lillard and Panis,
1998). We found earlier that divorced males are more often in the category “ever out” but
not in “attritors,” suggesting the effect of being divorced on participation in the survey
may be temporary.
We can summarize our main findings so far as follows:
1. Those who are “attritors” as of 2002 have different baseline characteristics in
terms of race and ethnicity, immigration status, education, health, and high
household income for females.
2. Those “ever out” are respondents who, in terms of baseline characteristics, are the
most different from those who remain always in the survey or those that are not
present as of 2002.
3. Those who are dead by 2002 had systematically lower SES than those who
survived, confirming evidence of differential mortality.
In terms of the first finding, since other characteristics than race and ethnicity, gender,
household composition and age are associated with attrition as of 2002, it is likely that
the MAR assumption implicit in using HRS weights is violated. The potential effects of
selection on observables on inference from the 2002 cross-section in HRS will depend on
the strength of the relationships of these characteristics with attrition and how they
correlate with outcomes of interest. We will use the estimates above to construct IPW.
The second finding is important for at least two reasons. First, it implies that using the
balanced sample with only those “always in” is likely to suffer from even stronger
selection on observables than when using the unbalanced sample. Second, it reveals how
important it might be for a longitudinal survey to re-contact non-respondents in latter
waves. A sizeable fraction of non-respondents does return and our analysis suggests that
these may have the type of characteristics that would otherwise make the attritors much
more susceptible to introducing serious selection on observables. Hence, it would appear
to be a desirable strategy for the overall representativity of a study to design mechanisms
that increase re-contact rates.9
Finally, our third result shows that it is important to acknowledge the possibility that
differential mortality distorts our view of the evolution of certain outcomes, such as
9

Rodgers (2006) shows that the increased incentives experiment in the 2000 wave of HRS had the strongest
participation effects among those who did not respond in previous waves. The response rate for those who
received $20 was 37.4%, while it was 45.2% for those who were offered $50.

19

wealth or income over the life-cycle. However, investigating effects of differential
mortality on inferences from the HRS is beyond the scope of this analysis.
Before attempting to gauge the effects of selection on observables on tabulations of
outcome of interest in 2002 using inverse probability weighting, the next section
considers other non-response problems that may bias the representativity of the HRS
cohort sample, particularly when studying pensions and Social Security entitlements and
receipt of benefits. A significant fraction of respondents did not give their consent to use
records from the SSA. The same holds true for pensions. HRS tries to obtain summary
pension plan descriptions from employers of respondents with a pension on the current
job. About one third of workers with a pension on the current job do not have such a
description, which is partly the result of missing information on employers provided by
respondents and non-consent by employers to provide such plans.

20

4. Linked Pension Summary Plan Description and Social Security Administration
Records
In 1992, HRS asked consent from respondents to request their earnings record and
benefit entitlement from the SSA. HRS also asked to get summary plan descriptions
(SPD) from employers of respondents who said they had a pension and reported the name
and address of their employer. These data are often used to study the effect of pension
incentives on retirement and other outcomes or to study the accuracy of self-reported
pension and social security wealth.
Table 4.1 reveals that nearly three quarters of respondents in 1992 gave consent
for HRS to obtain their Social Security records from SSA.10 Females are slightly more
likely to give consent than men (76.3% versus 73.7%). SPD matches can be from the
current job or from past jobs. We focus our analysis on current job pension matches. In
1992, 56.3% (52.5%) of male (female) workers declared to HRS that they had a pension
on their current job. HRS was able to collect SPDs for two thirds of these. This is slightly
lower than for the Social Security match. Permission to link to Social Security data and
obtaining an SPD match (for workers who self-report they have a pension on the job) are
significantly correlated for males (Chi-square = 4.83, p-value=0.028) but not for females.
For example, among males, 68.3% of workers who gave for permission the SSA match
also have a SPD. For those who did not give consent for the SSA match, 62.6% have a
SPD.

Although there are a few consents for whom the record could not be retrieved (e.g., a problem with
matching the self-reported SSN with a record), we use consent throughout to define the outcome of the
match. We focus on the match with the earnings record file. SSA & HRS released three files for researchers
to use. The first one is the earnings record file, which collects earnings of respondents from 1951 to 1991,
along with quarters of coverage for eligibility Social Security benefits. The second was constructed by
researchers (O. Mitchell, J. Olson and T. Steinmeier), and the third refers to wages and self-employment
income in non-covered jobs. We define our match indicator from the match with the first file, the earnings
record, since it is the most widely used source and, in fact, is the source of calculations for the second file.

21

Notes: RAND HRS files with earnings histories of respondents who gave their
consent. For SPDs on pensions, the variable created in the tracker file, version
2002, was used, and only respondents who had a match in 1992 were selected.
Self-report on pension policy holding on current job is used as the denominator in
calculating the match rate. The chi-square independence test is done for the
subset of respondents who report having a pension at their current job.

The outcome of the match may not be random. For example, it could proxy
general willingness to participate in surveys and/or an aversion to have private
information disclosed to a third party.11 One way to check this is to perform a logit of the
match outcome (1=match, 0=no match) on baseline characteristics of respondents. Table
4.2 present logit results for the Social Security match.

Both African-Americans and Hispanics are less likely to give consent to HRS to
obtain their earnings record at SSA. Interestingly, retired individuals are more likely to
give consent than workers. The probability of a match decreases with wealth and
increases with household income. The probability of a match is nearly 20% lower at the
top of the wealth distribution than at the bottom (holding other characteristics constant).
Along with the earnings record, HRS provides adjusted baseline weights for those
respondents with a match. However, these only take into account selection based on the
same characteristics as the HRS weights. Hence, from the results presented, they appear
insufficient to correct for selection on observables.
We perform the same exercise for the SPD match, looking at the probability of a
match in the sample of 1992 respondents who report having a pension on their current
job. Results in Table 4.3 reveal that there are important effects of education for both
males and females. Contrary to the SSA match, racial differences are small. AfricanAmericans born in the United States who report a pension on their job actually have
higher match rates than white and Hispanic respondents. The difference in terms of
education can be a proxy for firm size, since better-educated respondents tend to work in
larger firms, which tend to be better organized to provide SPDs. Similar to the SSA
match, the pseudo R-square is rather low (less than 0.05).

One might think that the match indicators proxy the general willingness to
participate in surveys or the level of tolerance the respondent has to divulging private
information (from the employer or SSA) to a third-party organization. One way to check
this possibility is to see if there is a correlation between the decision to give consent to
SSA (or pension) match and participation in later waves of the survey.
The top panel of Table 4.4 gives the distribution of participation sequences over
the period 1992–2002 conditional on the outcome of an SPD match and in the second
panel conditional on the outcome of an SSA match. Conditional on having a pension at
baseline, there is no difference between participation in the survey and the SPD match
outcome. This is in sharp contrast to the SSA consent decision, where large differences in
participation patterns are observed. Among those who refuse to have their record
matched, 25.3% will eventually leave the panel and not come back by 2002 compared to
11.2% among those who gave consent in 1992. A Chi-square independence test clearly
rejects the null of independence of the two outcomes. One possible reason for the low
association of the SPD match with panel participation is that the crucial factor for the
match is the employer rather than the employee.
To control for other characteristics associated with both decisions before
assessing whether the SSA match decision correlates with participation sequences, we reran the multinomial logits in Tables 3.3 and 3.4, explaining panel participation behavior
from 1992 and 2002, conditional on baseline controls and the match variables. The
results (in panel 3 of Table 4.4) show a strong negative association between the
probability of observing someone leave the panel and the decision to give consent to
merge their SSA record. The marginal effect is of similar magnitude as the raw difference
in attrition rates among the two groups (-15.9 and -14.2 percentage points for males and
females, respectively). This means that little of the relationship between the match and
future participation in the survey is explained by background characteristics.
The simplest explanation for the association is that the match outcome proxies for
unobservables related to the willingness both to participate in a survey and to have
24

sensitive information transferred from SSA to a third party. Respondents who have a low
willingness to participate in surveys may be less likely to give consent for an SSA
match.12 This will be less clear for the SPD match, since both respondents and employers
can decide not to provide the relevant information.

Notes: The first two panels report the distribution of sequence types by whether a match could be
obtained from their SPD or from the SSA for earnings record. The last panel repeats multinomial logits in
Table 3.3 and 3.4, adding match status variables as controls. This exercise is performed for the pension
match variable, conditional on having a pension in 1992, and for the SSA match variable on the whole
sample of 1992 respondents. These marginal effect are on the probability of attrition (as of 2002).

The results for the non-randomness of the SSA match are largely in line with
those reported in Olson (1999) and Haider and Solon (2000). However, they indicate
selection on observable effects that are hard to quantify. Hence, it is important to look at
how retirement outcomes in the subsamples with a match differ from those without a
match.
We look at how these selection on observable effects may explain differences in
expectations about retirement. These individual expectations are well-known to be
strongly correlated with future retirement outcomes and hence provide a good check on
how retirement patterns between the two groups will differ.
The HRS has expectation questions about when respondents, currently working,
expect to retire and when they expect to claim Social Security benefits. In addition, the
HRS collects data on the probability that the respondent will work past ages 62 and 65.
Table 4.5 shows that the distributions of these expectations for the groups with and

Another interpretation is that asking for SSN discourages future participation in the survey. It is not
possible to tell the two explanations apart.

25

without an SSA match or SPD match. For questions asking about expected age, there is a
considerable amount of missing data. Non-response to these questions is correlated with
each match variable, which may affect the comparisons we are about to make. However,
there is much less non-response for the subjective probabilities to work past ages 62 and
65. Conditional on providing a non-missing response, the distribution of expected ages of
retirement is quite similar among those who do not give consent for HRS to link their
information with an earnings record and those who do give consent. Things are less clearcut for the expected age to claim Social Security benefits. In 1992, those that give
consent expect to claim in a larger fraction at age 65 than at age 62. They report to be as
likely to work past 62 compared to those not giving consent but less likely to work past
age 65.
For the SPD match, differences are much larger. Those with a SPD match tend to
expect to retire earlier than those who do not have a match. They expect to claim Social
Security benefits sooner than those without a match as well. Finally, they report that they
are much more unlikely to work past 62 and even less likely to work after age 65 (43.8%
versus 55.2%).

To see if these differences result from selection on observables, we can use match
probabilities predicted from the logits in Table 4.2 and 4.3 to construct a set of weights
based on the same idea as the inverse probability weighting scheme developed in Section
3. If selection on observables is responsible for differences, particularly for the SPD
match where large differences occur, weighting should bring the two distributions (across
those with a match and those without) much closer. Table 4.6 presents the same
distributions as in Table 4.5, but weighted using predicted match probabilities.

Notes: 1992 distribution of expectations. A respondent must be working
to answer these questions, not have claimed Social Security benefits.
The employer pension merge tabulations are done on the sample of
workers who report having a pension on the current job in 1992. The %
of missings for each variable is reported. The other fractions are
reported conditional on providing a non-missing value. logit weights
used.

Differences among those who have an SSA match and those who don’t do not
disappear after weighting for known determinants of match probabilities. Things are quite
different, however, for the SPD match. Both for expected age for claiming Social
Security benefits and for the probability to work past age 62 and 65, the weighing
realigns both distributions. This suggests that selection on observables was behind these
observed differences for the SPD match. High education and high household income for
females were positively associated with an SPD match. However, differences in terms of
expected retirement age do not vanish. Differences appear particularly important at the
bottom of the age distribution (ages 50–61).
These findings seem to suggest that there is cause for concern when using the
sample of respondents with a match. Many characteristics of respondents are associated
with both SSA and SPD match. We find important selection on observable effects on the
distribution of retirement expectations for the SPD match, which implies that the sample
of respondents with a match is non-random. Weights help make the groups (with and
without a match) more similar, but some differences remain in the distribution of
expected retirement age. In the case of the SSA match, differences in expectations do not
appear to be as large as for the SPD match.
Ideally, to investigate the selective nature of the consent decision to a SSA match,
we would compare benefits received by those who gave consent and those who did not.
The problem is that very few respondents receive benefits in 1992, since they are age 51–
61 and the earliest age at which a person can claim an old-age Social Security benefit (on
his/her own account) is age 62. However, looking at later waves implies that we have to
exclude attritors, who, as we have seen, in higher proportion than others, did not consent
to have their SSA record matched. For example, out of those giving an interview in 2002,
only 20% did not have a match compared to 25% in 1992. This reflects the association
found in Table 4.4.
Another avenue would be to get a random sample of earnings records from SSA
in 1992 and compare it to the sample with a match in the HRS. Unfortunately, these data
are not publicly available. What is available is a 1% random sample of benefit records in
2001. The 2001 SSA Public Use MicroData File (SSA-PUF) consists of a 1% sample
from the Master Record of actual benefits paid to individuals in December 2001. Hence,
we complement our analysis of the representativity of the sample with a match in 2002
by not only comparing the distribution of benefits received between those with a match
and those without but by also comparing it to the distribution in the SSA-PUF database
for recipients from the same age cohort. We convert the monthly benefit to an annual
benefit (multiplying by 12) and exclude from both HRS and SSA-PUF all respondents
who have started claiming benefits after 2000. We do this to deal with respondents who

28

received benefits for part of the year.13 Because we are comparing to a external random
sample that does not over-sample certain groups, we weight HRS statistics using 2002
HRS weights to deal with the African American, Hispanic, and Floridian supplements
and with attrition from race and ethnicity, age, and gender. Hence, we essentially impose
the MAR assumption conditional on race, ethnicity, and gender and postpone using other
weighting schemes to the next section.
Table 4.7 presents various deciles of the distribution of annual benefits for all
HRS respondents (conditional on having claimed before 2000), for those with or without
a match with earnings record and finally for the sample selected from the SSA-PUF.

Notes: For the SSA Public Use MicroData File OASD 2001, we selected individuals born 1931–1941 and we only used in the
calculations benefits received from own earnings, from the spouse earnings, or from a deceased spouse’s earnings. 97441
records were used. The SSA Public Use files reports the monthly benefit payable for December 2001 and applies the annual
Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA of 2.6%) payable January 1st to this amount. We multiply this benefit by 12 and apply the
COLA to the HRS self-report for the year 2001. We select only respondents receiving benefits as of 2000 to avoid incomplete
years of benefit receipt. We applied 2002 HRS weights for HRS figures.

Remarkably, there appear to be no systematic differences in the various
distributions of annual Social Security benefits. The proportion of individuals receiving
benefits does not vary with the consent decision. The mean differs by no more than $200
across the three distributions (HRS with match, no match and SSA-PUF), both for males
and females. Differences across the distribution are also remarkably small and do not
appear to be systematic. Hence, although differences in terms of expectations persist,
even after weighting, differences in benefits actually received are very small and the
distributions compare well with the actual distribution from the 1% sample from the 2001
Master Record from SSA. This last comparison, however, suffers from the caveat that
attrition may have blurred some of the differences by 2002 because of the negative
association between match probabilities and attrition probabilities.

13

Since we extrapolate the monthly information in the SSA-PUF to a yearly benefit, we would otherwise
overestimate benefits for respondents who have claimed benefits recently and reported these “incomplete”
benefit streams to HRS.

5. Implications of Selection on Observables for 2002 Tabulations
Results from Section 3 showed that a significant number of baseline
characteristics (as well as wave-by-wave characteristics) are associated with attrition. In
this section, we use inverse probability weighting to measure the effects of selection on
observables on unconditional tabulations that could be done on the 2002 cross-section of
respondents. We measure this effect by comparing two weighting strategies that impose
different missing at random assumptions. HRS weights impose that outcomes and
attrition are random, conditional on race, ethnicity, household composition, gender, and
age. In Section 3, we showed that we could relax that assumption by adding to the
conditioning set a large set of baseline characteristics. This could be implemented by
using inverse probability weighting.
To implement inverse probability weighting, we need to construct retention
probabilities from the estimates in Section 3. We choose to construct those probabilities
from the baseline determinants of attrition (Table 3.3 and 3.4). The population of interest
in 2002 is that of individuals born between1931-1941 who are age 61 to age 71 in that
year. For those present in the sample in 1992, this means that their retention probability is
the probability to be “always in” or “ever out,” conditional on being alive in 2002. Since
we have individual predictions for each of these probabilities, we can calculate the
retention probability as
p( si | xi 0 ) =

p ( si , a | xi 0 ) + p( si ,e | xi 0 )
1 − p( si ,d | xi 0 )

.

(8)

where a refers to “always in”, e to “ever out” and d to “died”. Hence, given baseline
characteristics of each respondent and estimated parameters, we compute the predicted
retention probability for each respondent.
HRS weights in 2002 not only correct for selection on race, ethnicity, gender,
household composition and age, but also for over-sampling and other baseline nonresponse differences in HRS compared to the CPS. Hence, to make the IPW weights
comparable to the HRS weights, we need to adjust the IPW for over-sampling and other
differences in baseline non-response. Hence, we construct the inverse probability weights
as
wi ( x) =

w1992 (qi )
p ( si | xi 0 )

(9)

where w1992 (qi ) is the HRS weight for respondent with characteristics qi (race, ethnicity,
household composition, gender, and age). In the case where p( si | xi 0 ) = p ( si | qi ) , and
our interest is to estimate the mean of some outcome y in 2002 both weights will provide
the same estimate, In fact,
E ( si w(qi ) yi 2002 ) = E ( si w2002 (qi ) yi 2002 ) .

30

(10)

w1992 (qi )
= w(qi ) . Hence, the difference between estimates using the
p ( si | qi )
HRS weights (for 2002) and the IPW weights give us an indication of the bias introduced
by the fact that characteristics other than those in the HRS weights enter retention
probabilities.

since w2002 (qi ) =

Tables 5.1–5.4 show the effect of weighting on cross-sectional distribution of a
large number of socioeconomic outcomes of respondents in 2002. We show four
estimates. The first one is the unweighted statistic, while the second corrects for baseline
non-response and over-sampling using HRS 1992 weights. In most instances, making that
correction has a considerable effect. This correction tends to correct for the oversampling of groups with low SES or worst health outcomes, such as African Americans
and Hispanics. The third column shows the effect of adding to the baseline correction the
inverse probability weighting correction in eq. (8). In general, the effect of IPW
corrections are very small. When there is a change compared to the statistic in preceding
column, it tends to revise SES statistics downward and health statistics upward, which is
in line with the correlation between baseline characteristics and attrition. Finally, the
most important finding is that weighting using IPW makes hardly any difference
compared to using HRS weights from 2002. This tends to support that selection on
observables is present but that, conditional on characteristics that enter HRS weights, it is
random for virtually all outcomes we looked at.

Two main reasons may explain the lack of effect from selection on observables.
The first is that the group of attritors as of 2002 is quite small. It has to be very different
in terms of characteristics to cause shifts in the sample statistics we have computed.
Although it may not have effects on these tabulations, it could be that other analyses
could by affected, particularly those that use the wave-by-wave transitions in the data.
The second explanation has to do with the fact that the group that differs the most in
terms of baseline characteristics makes it back to the survey. As we have already
discussed, it might be that the group that may cause the most damage on the
representativity of the sample is captured back in the study.
To check that possibility, we perform the following exercise. We assume
respondents “ever out” do not make it back to the study for the 2002 interview. Hence, if
we were to assess the effect of selection on observables on statistics computed on
33

respondents in 2002, the only group interviewed would be the “always in” group or what
is commonly known as the balanced sample from the panel.
To assess the effect of selection on observable on that sample, we would do the
same test with IPW and HRS weights in 2002, except that retention probabilities would
be given by
p ( si ,a | xi 0 )
p ( si | xi 0 ) =
1 − p ( si ,d | xi 0 )
since those “ever out” would not be in the study in 2002. Hence, we redo some
tabulations on that sample using IPW and HRS weights. We perform those tabulations for
total wealth and household income, two outcomes that are likely to be sensitive to
selection on observables. The evidence in Table 5.3 showed a quite small selection effect
for wealth for males while not for females and no difference for household income.
Tables 5.5 and 5.6 present the statistics for the “always in” sample only and for the
sample that includes the “ever out” respondents (as statistics in Table 5.4). Results show
strong selection on observable effects for household income and wealth when using the
balanced sample. For example, the difference in total wealth using the IPW weights and
HRS weights on the balanced sample is nearly $15,000 at the median. This difference is
negligible when including those “ever out.” There is, therefore, a strong case to make for
using the unbalanced sample (using those “ever out”) rather than the balanced sample.

6. Conclusions
In this study, we have investigated the effects that attrition and missing links with
administrative data might have on inferences in the HRS. Our analysis focused on the
HRS cohort born 1931–1941 that was interviewed every two years since 1992. We have
restricted our analysis to biases introduced by selection on observables on cross-sectional
inferences on the sample of initial respondents interviewed in 2002. Our main strategy
has been to investigate the determinants of attrition and non-response and analyze how
weighting schemes that are easy to implement could be use to address potential biases.
Our main conclusion is that for traditional cross-sectional tabulations made in 2002 for
this age range, there is very little evidence of attrition bias from selection on observables
that would warrant the use of more complicated weighting schemes than the weights
provided by HRS. These match along certain characteristics the representativity of the
sample to that of the CPS. There is selection on observables, but this is mostly from race,
ethnicity, gender, and age, factors that enter the HRS weights. This lack of additional
selection effect appears to result from the finding that respondents who differ the most
eventually make it back to the study and that the group of attritors, as of 2002, remains
small (less than 15%) in comparison to other past studies that might not have re-contacted
non-respondents.
We have also looked at the non-randomness of the match of respondents’ records with
their SSA earnings record and SPD information provided by employers. We found that
various baseline characteristics of respondents were correlated with the probability of a
match, in addition to race, ethnicity, gender, and age. For the SSA record match, this is in
line with findings by Olson (1999) and Haider and Solon (2000). Adjusted HRS weights
provided with the earnings record are insufficient to address selection on observables. We
then looked at expectations about retirement outcomes in groups defined by whether a
match was done or not. Expectations were different for both match (SSA and SPD),
although differences for the SPD match appeared larger. We found that in the case of
SPD, the non-randomness was significantly—but not entirely—explained by selection on
observables, particularly from selection on education. More educated workers who report
they have a pension on the current job were more likely to have a match. In the case of
the SSA match, weighting did little to correct the smaller differences we observed
between the groups with and without a match. An interesting finding is that SSA match
probabilities were found to be negatively associated with future attrition probabilities
from the study, but that when we looked at the distribution of Social Security benefits of
those with and without a match in 2000, no difference was observed between the groups.
These finding has some implications for practitioners. We have found that the balanced
sample—the sample that excludes those who come back to the study—suffers from
significant selection on observables when looking at financial outcomes in 2002. Hence,
we would argue in favor of using the unbalanced sample in longitudinal analysis.
However, this creates important methodological challenges, since respondents who skip
waves are hard to incorporate in most panel data models. Another implication is that
users of matched data should be concerned about the representativity of the matched HRS
sample with administrative records (either from SSA or employers).

Appendix A: Construction of Analytic File
Choice of Sample
We used the RAND HRS release E, based on the final release of waves 1992, 1994,
1996, 1998, 2000, and 2002, along with the tracker file 2002. The tracker file was first
used to select respondents of the HRS cohort (born between 1931 and 1941) and to select
a number of variables such as interview status, sample status, and vital status, as well as
the pension match indicator. The Social Security match indicator is taken from merging
the tracker file with the earnings record provided by SSA. We omitted from the sample
respondents later assigned to the AHEAD cohort, known as AHEAD/HRS overlap cases.
We merged data from the RAND HRS for each wave. We selected respondents who were
born between 1931 and 1941. This exclusion led to the elimination of spouses of HRS
cohort members not born in those years. In total 9,824 core interviews are completed in
1992, including 65 AHEAD/HRS overlap cases. Omitting those gives the figure in Table
A.1 of 9,761 core interviews completed in 1992.

Definition of Variables
We used two panel status variables in this analysis. The first one tracks the status a
respondent’s record in 2002, conditional on being interviewed in 1992. We defined four
states: (1) continuously interviewed between 1992 and 2002; (2) missed some interviews
but interviewed in 1992 and 2002; (3) died prior to 2002; and (4) not interviewed in 2002
for reasons other than death. The variables used for this construction are xiwwave and
xalive from the tracker file. Someone who was reported dead in 2002 is defined as (3)
(died), even though an exit interview was collected in 2002. Someone presumed alive by
the interviewer is defined as alive. The other status variable is a wave-specific variable
that uses the same information as the cumulative status variable but tracks the status at
each wave (1 = core interview provided, 2 = dead, 3 = no interview provided, known
alive). Table A.2 documents the variables we use in the analysis.
