Summary. We prove identification of dependent competing risks models in which each risk
has a mixed proportional hazard specification with regressors, and the risks are dependent by
way of the unobserved heterogeneity, or frailty, components. We show that the conditions for
identification given by Heckman and Honoré can be relaxed. We extend the results to the case
in which multiple spells are observed for each subject.

Introduction

A spell in a state can often end for various reasons. Competing risks models specify the observed duration or failure time as the minimum of a number of competing latent failure times
and the corresponding cause of failure as the identity of the smallest latent failure time. Suppose
that there are two competing risks, i.e. competing causes of failure, A and B, with corresponding jointly continuous non-negative random failure times TA and TB . The extension to more
than two risks is trivial and will not be considered in this paper. The observed failure time T
equals mini∈{A,B} .Ti / and the cause of failure I is arg mini∈{A,B} .Ti /. Jointly, .T , I/ is called the
identiﬁed minimum of TA and TB .
It is well known that the joint distribution of .TA , TB / is not identiﬁed from the joint distribution of .T , I/ (Cox, 1959, 1962; Tsiatis, 1975). In particular, for any joint distribution of
the latent failure times there is a joint distribution with independent latent failure times that
generates the same distribution of the identiﬁed minimum. The joint distribution of the latent
failure times can only be identiﬁed if some additional structure is imposed, e.g. independence
of TA and TB .
A particular popular class of competing risks models assumes that the hazard rates of the
latent failure times have mixed proportional hazard (MPH) speciﬁcations, so that they depend
multiplicatively on the elapsed duration, observed regressors and unobserved heterogeneity, or
frailty, components (Lancaster, 1990; van den Berg, 2001). If the unobserved determinants are
dependent across the risks then the failure times are dependent given the regressors. In practice

there is often ample reason to expect such dependence, in particular if the subject is an individual
whose behaviour may affect all hazard rates.
Heckman and Honoré (1989) considered a model that nests the MPH competing risks model.
They showed that the model is identiﬁed if there is sufﬁcient variation in the latent failure
times with the regressors. Here, identiﬁability concerns the invertibility of the mapping from
the model determinants to the distribution of .T , I/ (which summarizes the population data).
Identiﬁcation is nonparametric in the sense that no parametric functional forms are assumed
for the model determinants (like the base-line hazards and the frailty distribution in the
MPH case). Identiﬁability is useful because it implies that the estimates of the model speciﬁcation are not completely driven by parametric functional form assumptions on the model
determinants.
In this paper we show that the conditions of Heckman and Honoré (1989) can be relaxed
considerably in the MPH case. In particular, our results require much less variation in the latent
failure times with the regressors. As such, this paper provides conditions for identiﬁcation for
the case in which Heckman and Honoré’s (1989) assumption on the covariate effects is not
satisﬁed by the data. This is relevant to empirical work, as in many applications our condition
will be satisﬁed, whereas Heckman and Honoré’s (1989) stronger condition fails to hold.
In this paper we also extend the identiﬁcation analysis to the case with multiple-spell data,
i.e. data on more than one identiﬁed minimum for each subject. This extension to multiple
spells is quite natural in the MPH framework. Within this framework, multiple-spell data can
be viewed as providing multiple independent draws from the subject-speciﬁc distribution of the
identiﬁed minimum, so that the unobserved determinants are identical across the spells. Such
data are frequently available in, for example, econometric applications (van den Berg, 2001).
In the context of a single risk, it is well known that multiple-spell data allow for identiﬁcation
under much less stringent conditions than do single-spell data (Honoré, 1993). We show that
this carries over to competing risks models.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the MPH competing risks model is introduced. Sections 3 and 4 deal with the identiﬁcation for single-spell data and multiple-spell data
respectively. Section 5 concludes.

The mixed proportional hazards competing risks model

The MPH model is an extension of the Cox (1972) proportional hazard model that was introduced by Lancaster (1979) and Vaupel et al. (1979). The bivariate MPH model is a convenient framework to model the dependence of the latent failure times TA and TB . It traces all
such dependence to related observed and unobserved determinants of both durations. More
formally, it speciﬁes that TA and TB are independent conditional on .x, VA , VB /, where x is a
vector of (observed) regressors and VA and VB are unobserved non-negative random variables
that are distributed independently of x such that Pr.VA > 0, VB > 0/ > 0. The distribution
of .TA , TB /|.x, VA , VB / then factorizes in the marginal distributions of TA |.x, VA , VB / and TB |.x,
VA , VB /, which are fully characterized by the corresponding hazard rates,
θA .t|x, VA , VB / = λA .t/ φA .x/VA ,
θB .t|x, VA , VB / = λB .t/ φB .x/VB :
The base-line hazards λA : R+ → .0, ∞/ and λB : R+ → .0, ∞/ have integrals

for all t ∈ R+ := [0, ∞/. φA : X → .0, ∞/ and φB : X → .0, ∞/ are continuous regressor functions, with X the support of x. In applications, these functions are frequently speciﬁed as φA .x/ =
exp.x βA / and φB .x/ = exp.x βB / for some parameter vectors βA and βB . We shall not make
such parametric assumptions. We normalize

φA .xÅ / = φB .xÅ / = 1
for some a priori chosen t Å ∈ .0, ∞/ and xÅ ∈ X . These normalizations are innocuous because
VA and VB can capture the scale of θA and θB .
Using the conditional independence of TA and TB and standard expressions for the marginal
survival functions of TA |.x, VA , VB / and TB |.x, VA , VB /, we obtain
Pr.TA > tA , TB > tB |x, VA , VB / = exp{−ΛA .tA / φA .x/VA − ΛB .tB / φB .x/VB } :
The joint survival function of .TA , TB /|x then follows by taking the expectation over .VA , VB /
with respect to the distribution G of .VA , VB /, which gives
S.tA , tB |x/ := Pr.TA > tA , TB > tB |x/ = LG {ΛA .tA / φA .x/, ΛB .tB / φB .x/}:

An interesting feature of the model is that it allows for two different sources of defectiveness of
the distribution of .TA , TB /|x. First, the unobserved heterogeneity components VA and VB may
have mass points at 0. Second, we allow that limt→∞ {ΛA .t/} < ∞ and limt→∞ {ΛB .t/} < ∞.
Abbring (2002) has provided discussion and examples of applications.
Heckman and Honoré (1989) did not restrict attention to the class of models captured by
equation (1) but considered a somewhat more general speciﬁcation,

The main identification result

First, note that the joint distribution of the identiﬁed minimum .T , I/|x is fully characterized
by the subsurvival functions (Tsiatis, 1975)
QA .t|x/ := Pr .TA > t, TB > TA |x/ ,
QB .t|x/ := Pr .TB > t, TA > TB |x/ :

.4/

In the analysis of identiﬁcation, QA .·|x/ and QB .·|x/ are taken to be known for all x ∈ X . Note
that S.t, t|x/ = QA .t|x/ + QB .t|x/. The subsurvival functions can be characterized explicitly in

terms of the corresponding subdensities, which are given by
−Qi .t|x/ = −λi .t/ φi .x/Di LG {ΛA .t/ φA .x/, ΛB .t/ φB .x/} ,

i = A, B,

.5/

for almost all t. Here, Qi .t|x/ := @Qi .t|x/=@t and Di LG .sA , sB / := @LG .sA , sB /=@si .
We need a general result on completely monotone functions.
Deﬁnition 1. Let Ω be a non-empty open set in Rn . A function f : Ω → R is absolutely monotone if it is non-negative and has non-negative continuous partial derivatives of all orders. f is
completely monotone if f ◦ m is absolutely monotone, where m : x ∈ {ω ∈ Rn : −ω ∈ Ω} → −x.
For n = 1 this deﬁnition reduces to the familiar deﬁnitions in Widder (1946).
Proposition 1. Let Ψ be a non-empty open connected set in Rn and let f : Ψ → R and g :
Ψ → R be completely monotone. If f and g agree on a non-empty open set in Ψ, then f = g.
The proof is available from the authors on request. It exploits two facts that are well known
for functions on R and that are also true for functions on Rn :
(a) completely monotone functions are real analytic and
(b) real analytic functions are uniquely determined by their values on a non-empty open set.
We make the following assumptions on the MPH competing risks model (1).
(a) Variation with observed regressors: {.φA .x/, φB .x//; x ∈ X } contains a non-empty open
set Φ ⊂ R2 (assumption 1).
(b) Tail of the frailty distribution: E[VA ] < ∞ and E[VB ] < ∞ (assumption 2).
Heckman and Honoré (1989) tightened assumption 1 by imposing that Φ = .0, ∞/2 . The restriction to MPH competing risks models provides us with the latitude to relax this strong
assumption on the regressor effects. With two regressors and φi .x/ = exp.x βi /, it is sufﬁcient
for assumption 1 that (βA βB ) has full rank and X contains a non-empty open set in R2 .
Note that assumption 1 is fundamentally weaker than exclusion restrictions of the sort that
are encountered in instrumental variable analysis, which require a regressor that affects one
endogenous variable but not the other. Assumption 2 is a standard assumption in the singlespell MPH literature (e.g. Elbers and Ridder (1982)). Ridder (1990) showed that this assumption
cannot be omitted without loss of identiﬁcation.
We have the following result.
Proposition 2. Under assumptions 1 and 2, the MPH competing risks model (characterized
by the functions φA , φB , ΛA , ΛB and LG ) is identiﬁed from the distribution of .T , I/|x.
Proof. The proof successively establishes identiﬁcation of (a) the regressor functions (φA ,φB ),
(b) the Laplace transform LG of the frailty distribution, by exploiting proposition 1 and the variation in .φA .x/, φB .x//, and (c) the integrated base-line hazards (ΛA ,ΛB ), as the unique solution
to an initial value problem involving data, .φA .x/, φB .x// (for arbitrary x ∈ X ) and LG .
(a) Pick an arbitrary x ∈ X . For almost all t, Q .·|x/ and Q .·|xÅ / are differentiable and

where we use φA .xÅ / = φB .xÅ / = 1. As t ↓ 0, equation (6) reduces to φA .x/ because
DA LG .·/ → E[VA ] < ∞ by assumption 2. Note that here it is crucial that VA is independent of x. Since x is arbitrary, this identiﬁes φA . Identiﬁcation of φB is analogous.

(b) Evaluating equation (1) at tA = tB = t Å gives S.t Å , t Å |x/ = LG {φA .x/, φB .x/} because
Λ .t Å / = Λ .t Å / = 1. Note that S.t Å , t Å |x/ is observed and .φ , φ / is identiﬁed in part

(a). So, we can let .φA .x/, φB .x// range over the set Φ of assumption 1 to trace out LG on
a non-empty open set. As LG is completely monotone, this identiﬁes LG by proposition 1.
(c) Pick an arbitrary x ∈ X . We can rewrite equation (5) as a system of differential equations
in the sense of Carathéodory (1918), i.e. for almost all t ∈ .0, ∞/
Λ .t/ = f {t, Λ.t/} ,

with initial conditions ΛA .t Å / = ΛB .t Å / = 1:

Here,
fi {t, Λ.t/} := Qi .t|x/ [φi .x/Di LG {φA .x/ ΛA .t/, φB .x/ ΛB .t/}]−1 ,

i = A, B,

and Λ := .ΛA , ΛB / and f := .fA , fB /. The function f is known, as we observe the
functions QA and QB and have identiﬁed the numbers φA .x/, φB .x/ and the function
LG in (a) and (b). Standard theory implies that expression (7) has a unique solution
Λ on [0, ∞/ in terms of f , and the remainder of the proof demonstrates this. Write
fi .t, Λ/ = −Qi .t|x/ ri .Λ/, with
ri .Λ/ := −[φi .x/Di LG {φA .x/ΛA , φB .x/ΛB }]−1 ,

i = A, B:

Note that r := .rA , rB / is continuously differentiable and, by implication, satisﬁes a
Lipschitz condition on compact sets K ⊂ .0, ∞/2 . Because |QA .·|x/ + QB .·|x/| is integrable on compact sets J ⊂ .0, ∞/ and
||f.t, Λ/ − f.t, Λ̃/||  |QA .t|x/ + QB .t|x/| · ||r.Λ/ − r.Λ̃/||

.8/

for all .t, Λ/, .t, Λ̃/ ∈ J × K, this implies that f satisﬁes a generalized Lipschitz condition
with respect to Λ on J ×K for all compact J and K (Walter (1998), section 10, supplement
II). By Walter (1998), theorem 10.XX(b), this implies that expression (7) has a unique solution Λ on .0, ∞/. With ΛA .0/ = 0 and ΛB .0/ = 0, this uniquely determines Λ on [0, ∞/. 

LG in turn identiﬁes G by the uniqueness of the bivariate Laplace transform. Also, note that
step (c) of the proof can be repeated for all x ∈ X . This would give a range of unique solutions
Λ to expression (7). Obviously, all these solutions should be the same, which provides overidentifying restrictions that are similar to those discussed by Melino and Sueyoshi (1990) for the
single-risk MPH model.
To break the non-identiﬁcation result of Cox (1959, 1962) and Tsiatis (1975) we exploit that
we can independently vary φA .x/ and φB .x/. Some intuition can be derived from the (observed)
crude hazard rate

−DA LG {ΛA .t/ φA .x/, ΛB .t/ φB .x/}

This is the rate of failure due to cause A at time t conditional on x and survival up to time t. The
ratio on the right-hand side equals E [VA |x, TA > t, TB > t]. Suppose that we know φA and φB .
By assumption 1 we can vary φB .x/ for ﬁxed φA .x/ by appropriately varying x. First, suppose
that VA and VB are independent, so that LG factorizes in the Laplace transforms LGA and LGB
of the marginal distributions GA of VA and GB of VB . Then,

is clearly not affected by a change in φB .x/ that leaves φA .x/ unchanged. After all, E[VA |x, TA
> t, TB > t] = E[VA |x, TA > t] only depends on x through φA .x/. However, if VA and VB
are dependent, E [VA |x, TA > t, TB > t] generally depends on x through φB .x/ as well and
−QA .t|x/=S.t, t|x/ changes. This is due to the well-known fact that VB and φB .x/ are dependent
conditional on survival TB > t > 0 even if VB and x are independent unconditionally. So, conditional on TB > t, φB .x/ affects VA indirectly through VB . In conclusion, the variation in the
crude hazard −QA .t|x/=S.t, t|x/ with φB .x/ for given φA .x/ is informative on the dependence
of VA and VB . An analogous argument holds for the crude hazard corresponding to cause B,
−QB .t|x/=S.t, t|x/.

Identification with multiple spells

So far, we have focused on single-spell competing risks models, which specify the distribution of
the identiﬁed minimum .T , I/ of a single pair of latent failure times .TA , TB /. Instead, suppose
that we observe two spells in a stratum that is characterized by a single realization of .VA , VB /.
The stratum could either correspond to a single physical unit, like an individual, for which we
observe two spells in exactly the same state, or consist of single spells corresponding to two
similar physical units, e.g. twins. For each stratum, we observe two identiﬁed minima .T1 , I1 /
and .T2 , I2 /, with Tk = mini∈{A,B} .Ti,k / and Ik = arg mini∈{A,B} .Ti,k / for some latent failure
times .TA,k , TB,k /, k = 1, 2. We ﬁrst suppress regressors x. The main result does not rely on
regressor variation and we can think of the analysis as being conditional on x. In particular, we
allow .VA , VB / to be dependent on x (this was not allowed in Sections 2 and 3).
We assume that the pairs of latent failure times .TA,1 , TB,1 / and .TA,2 , TB,2 / are independent
conditional on .VA , VB /. In other words, multiple spells within a stratum are only dependent
through the unobserved determinants. If we also again assume that the latent failure times are
independent conditional on .VA , VB /, the joint distribution of .TA,1 , TB,1 , TA,2 , TB,2 /|.VA , VB /
factorizes in the marginal distributions of Ti,k |.VA , VB /, i = A, B and k = 1, 2. In turn, these are
characterized by the corresponding hazard rates θi,k .t|VA , VB / = λi,k .t/Vi , where the base-line
hazards λi,k : R+ → .0, ∞/ have integrals
 t
Λi,k .t/ :=
λi,k .τ / dτ < ∞
0

for all t ∈ R+ , i = A, B and k = 1, 2. We normalize ΛA,1 .t Å / = ΛB,1 .t Å / = 1 for some
a priori chosen t Å ∈ .0, ∞/. These normalizations are again innocuous because VA and VB
can capture the scale of the ﬁrst-spell hazards θA,1 and θB,1 . The joint survival function of
.TA,1 , TB,1 , TA,2 , TB,2 /|.VA , VB / easily follows as
Pr.TA,1 > tA,1 , TB,1 > tB,1 , TA,2 > tA,2 , TB,2 > tB,2 |VA , VB /
= exp{−ΛA,1 .tA,1 /VA − ΛB,1 .tB,1 /VB − ΛA,2 .tA,2 /VA − ΛB,2 .tB,2 /VB }:
Finally, taking expectations with respect to the unobservables .VA , VB / gives
S.tA,1 , tB,1 , tA,2 , tB,2 / := Pr.TA,1 > tA,1 , TB,1 > tB,1 , TA,2 > tA,2 , TB,2 > tB,2 /
= LG {ΛA,1 .tA,1 / + ΛA,2 .tA,2 /, ΛB,1 .tB,1 / + ΛB,2 .tB,2 /}:

It is intuitively clear that multiple-spell data facilitate identiﬁcation. The analogies with linear
panel data models with ﬁxed effects and the models for paired duration data of Holt and Prentice
(1974) and Holt (1978) suggest that we can deal with unobserved heterogeneity in multiple-spell
data by exploiting within-stratum variation. Indeed, we have the following result.
Proposition 3.
(a) The functions ΛA,1 , ΛB,1 , ΛA,2 and ΛB,2 are identiﬁed from the distribution of .T1 , I1 ,
T2 , I2 /.
(b) LG is identiﬁed if {.ΛA,1 .t1 / + ΛA,2 .t2 /, ΛB,1 .t1 / + ΛB,2 .t2 //; .t1 , t2 / ∈ R2+ } contains a
non-empty open set in R2 .
Proof.
(a) The distribution of .T1 , I1 , T2 , I2 / provides the probabilities of all (sub)survival events
like .TA,1 > t1 , TB,1 > TA,1 , TA,2 > t2 , TB,2 > t2 /. So, analogously to equation (5) we can
compute the subdensity
−

@ Pr.TA,1 > t1 , TB,1 > TA,1 , TA,2 > t2 , TB,2 > t2 /
@t1
= −λA,1 .t1 /DA LG {ΛA,1 .t1 / + ΛA,2 .t2 /, ΛB,1 .t1 / + ΛB,2 .t2 /}

for almost all t1 and all t2 and the subdensity
−

@ Pr.TA,1 > t1 , TB,1 > t1 , TA,2 > t2 , TB,2 > TA,2 /
@t2
= −λA,2 .t2 /DA LG {ΛA,1 .t1 / + ΛA,2 .t2 /, ΛB,1 .t1 / + ΛB,2 .t2 /}

for almost all t2 and all t1 . With the normalization ΛA,1 .t Å / = 1, this implies that
ΛA,2 .t/ =

which identiﬁes ΛA,1 for arbitrary t2 ∈ .0, ∞/. ΛB,1 and ΛB,2 can be identiﬁed analogously.
(b) The distribution of .T1 , I1 , T2 , I2 / provides data on S.t1 , t1 , t2 , t2 / for .t1 , t2 / ∈ R2+ . By equation (9), S.t1 , t1 , t2 , t2 / = LG {ΛA,1 .t1 / + ΛA,2 .t2 /, ΛB,1 .t1 / + ΛB,2 .t2 /}. So, because ΛA,1 ,
ΛB,1 , ΛA,2 and ΛB,2 are identiﬁed by (a), we can trace LG on a non-empty open set. By
proposition 1, this identiﬁes LG .


This result does not require regressor variation. Rather, we implicitly allow for conditioning on regressors x. In particular, we can think of the base-line hazards as being speciﬁc to a
particular value of x and thus allow for general interactions between elapsed duration t and
x. A problem seems to be that the normalizations exclude variation in the ﬁrst-spell base-line
hazards with x at time t Å . However, this is again innocuous because we allow for dependence of
.VA , VB / and x, so that VA and VB can capture the dependence on x of the ﬁrst-spell hazards at

708

t Å . Thus, the normalizations only matter if a physical interpretation is given to the actual frailty

variables, which is usually not the case.
If the condition in proposition 3, part (b), is not satisﬁed, the identiﬁability of LG is not
guaranteed. For example, if all four latent durations are exponential and spells are identically
distributed within strata, i.e. if Λi,k .t/ ≡ t for i = A, B and k = 1, 2, then we can only trace LG
on a 45◦ line through the origin and the proof of part (b) breaks down. In this case, we can resort
to regressor variation. Suppose that we again have a vector of regressors x that is independent of
.VA , VB /. We specify θi,k .t|x, VA , VB / = πi,k .t|x/Vi , where the functions πi,k .·|x/ : R+ → .0, ∞/
have integrals
 t
πi,k .τ |x/ dτ < ∞
Πi,k .t|x/ :=
0

for all t ∈ R+ and for given x ∈ X , i = A, B and k = 1, 2. We assume that Πi,k is continuous on
R+ × X , i = A, B and k = 1, 2, and normalize ΠA,1 .t Å |xÅ / = ΠB,1 .t Å |xÅ / = 1 for some a priori
chosen t Å ∈ .0, ∞/ and xÅ ∈ X . Note that ΠA,1 .t Å |x/ and ΠB,1 .t Å |x/ are allowed to vary with
x. We simply extend the condition in proposition 3, part (b), into assumption 3 (variation with
observed regressors):
{.ΠA,1 .t1 |x/ + ΠA,2 .t2 |x/, ΠB,1 .t1 |x/ + ΠB,2 .t2 |x//; .t1 , t2 , x/ ∈ R2+ × X } contains a nonempty open set in R2 :

A sufﬁcient condition for assumption 3 is that πi,k is proportional in a base-line hazard
λi,k and a regressor function φi,k as in the single-spell case, i = A, B and k = 1, 2, and that
.φA,1 + φA,2 , φB,1 + φB,2 / satisﬁes assumption 1. We have the following proposition.
Proposition 4. If assumptions 2 and 3 are satisﬁed, then the multiple-spell MPH competing
risks model (which is characterized by the functions ΠA,1 , ΠB,1 , ΠA,2 , ΠB,2 and LG ) is identiﬁed
from the distribution of .T1 , I1 , T2 , I2 /|x.
Proof. For given x ∈ X , the model ﬁts the framework of proposition 3 with base-lines
Λi,k and unobserved factors Ṽi such that Λi,k .t/ = Πi,k .t|x/=Πi,1 .t Å |x/ for all t ∈ R+ and Ṽi =
Πi,1 .t Å |x/Vi , i = A, B and k = 1, 2. So, Πi,k .·|x/=Πi,1 .t Å |x/, i = A, B, is identiﬁed by proposition 3. Identiﬁcation of Πi,1 .t Å |·/, i = A, B, and LG follows from the obvious multiple-spell
equivalent to the ﬁrst two steps of the proof of proposition 2.

The results in this section are akin to the multiple-spell results of Honoré (1993) for single-risk
models. However, the competing risks nature of the data complicates matters. If the condition
in proposition 3, part (b), is not satisﬁed, much of the strength of the multiple-spell argument
is lost. Even in this case, however, we can still allow for general non-proportionality between
duration and regressors.

Conclusion

The main result of this paper is that the dependent MPH competing risks model with regressors
is identiﬁed under milder conditions than those in Heckman and Honoré (1989). In particular,
Heckman and Honoré (1989) assumed a large support, .0, ∞/2 , of the proportional regressor
effects on the hazards of the latent failure times. We only need that this support includes a nonempty open set in R2 . In applications, our lesser condition is much more likely to be satisﬁed.
We extend the results to the multiple-spell case.

In applied work, the interest is sometimes restricted to the covariate effects (although in econometrics the duration dependence functions are often of independent interest; see for example
Machin and Manning (1999)). In this context it is interesting that the identiﬁcation proofs for
the single-spell case in this paper and in Heckman and Honoré (1989) are constructive, i.e. they
express the model determinants in terms of observables. This suggests an estimation method
for covariate effects based on these expressions. From the proofs it is clear that the support of
the covariates x does not play a role in such an estimation method; it can be applied even when
x assumes only two values. However, it is also clear that such an estimation method is very
unattractive from a practical point of view, since it is only based on observations with durations
close to 0. It may be more promising to explore the following estimation approach: ﬁrst, estimate
all model determinants along the lines of our constructive identiﬁcation proof and, second, reestimate the covariate effects using data on all durations, exploiting the estimates of the ﬁrst
step. The study of the properties of such estimators may be a fruitful topic for further research.
For the multiple-spell case, the stratiﬁed partial likelihood estimator provides estimates of
proportional covariate effects under weak identifying conditions (Holt and Prentice (1974) and
Holt (1978); see van den Berg (2001) for discussion). We provide constructive identiﬁcation
proofs for a multiple-spell competing risks model that allows for general interactions of covariate effects and durations, and for different covariate–duration effects between spells in a
stratum. As in the single-spell case, these may be used for the development of estimators.
