Abstract The issue considered in this study is whether there is misreporting in
official data on disability status. While there is a rather large literature on misreporting
of self-assessed disability, evidence regarding register data is scant. It seems to be a
widely held view among researchers that, since individuals out of work are inclined
to respond towards poor health, it would be best to have official data provided by
the relevant administrative bodies. But we argue that such administrative data should
be regarded with some suspicion, since the administrators also may have incentives
to misreport. The empirical evidence, based on a large sample of Swedish jobseekers, suggests systematic misreporting by the Public Employment Service of official
disability measures due to incentives to misreport disability.

“subjective”, usually self-reported, information and more “objective” data, often based
on administrative sources, like mortality records or medical reports.1 The type of
information is not necessarily tied to the source, however, as individuals can selfreport on objective indicators while officials may report on subjective indicators.
According to the literature, both subjective and objective disability may be reported with error. Subjective data may be biased due to a variety of reasons—responses
being dependent on labour market outcomes one wishes to explain, justification of
current or anticipated non-employment status or financial incentives to report a disability. In addition, both subjective and objective measures may contain non-systematic
classification errors. Although more objective measures are commonly assumed to be
less biased, they may be contaminated by non-systematic errors. In particular, it has
been pointed out that the fact that objective measures rarely consider work capacity
introduces non-systematic error.
Our study differs from previous analyses of the reliability of health measures. In earlier work, the focus is mostly on the evaluation of self-assessed measures. It seems to be
a widely held view among researchers that, since individuals out of work are inclined
to respond towards poor health, it would be best to have official data provided by the
relevant administrative bodies [like the Disability Insurance (DI) administration or the
Public Employment Service (PES)]. However, other researchers have raised concerns
that some European countries, like Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands, mask their
levels of unemployment by classifying relatively healthy individuals as disabled instead of unemployed (see, e.g., Haveman et al. 1984). Up to now, little evidence based
on individual data has been provided regarding systematic misreporting of this kind.
We consider a particular official measure of work disability status, namely data
for individuals registered at the Swedish PES. The classification is used by the PES
officials in order to facilitate placement of unemployed persons in various labour
market programmes for the work disabled. Throughout the paper, we will refer to this
measure of work disability as “register” or “official” data, not as “objective” data.
Consequently, we also use the terms “self-reported” or “self-assessed” health, not
“subjective” health, in the following. We investigate whether the official reports on
disability status are systematically misreported. Our concern for a flawed measure
arises from the observation that there are incentives for disability classification errors,
both among the PES officials and the jobseekers, who could attempt to influence the
PES officials’ decisions. One can think of several reasons for such errors to occur.
First, PES officials may have incentives for classifying healthy individuals as disabled
due to various quantitative targets. There are such targets with the respect to the
placement of disabled workers in subsidised jobs as well as regarding the placement
of unemployed workers in regular jobs. The latter goal can be more easily achieved by
placing individuals with low qualifications in subsidised jobs for disabled workers. A
classification as disabled is necessary for access to labour market programmes targeted
to the disabled, such as subsidised employment and sheltered employment. Second,
funding to the PES offices increases in the caseload of disabled jobseekers. Third,

a disability classification may represent an attractive option also for non-disabled
jobseekers, due to the reduced work pace and secure employment that characterise
many jobs for the disabled.
We contrast the PES data to contemporaneous, self-reported data on disability for
the same individuals, extracted from the Labour Force Surveys (LFS). In order to examine systematic misreporting in the disability classification, we investigate whether
the individual’s unemployment contributes to him or her being classified as disabled
by the PES office. We find that the likelihood that an individual is classified as disabled
in the PES data, but not in the LFS, increases in accumulated months of unemployment, even after controlling for other individual characteristics. This result indicates
systematic misreporting in the register data and is consistent with the view that PES
officials and jobseekers have incentives to misreport disability. We perform various
robustness checks and the same monotonic relationship between the PES–LFS differerence and unemployment appears in all cases, which lends support to our view that
we have identified a causal mechanism. Our estimates on how the classification error
increases with unemployment could potentially be used for reducing this type of error
in disability data.
We believe that our results should have implications also for the reliability of other
administrative measures. If these measures are also influenced by the incentives of
the persons making the classifications and the incentives of the individuals being
classified, the absence of systematic misreporting should not be taken for granted.
Our results can be contrasted to those of Benitez-Silva et al. (2004), who also
compare official data on disability with self-reports. Under the maintained assumption
that register data are correct, the hypothesis that self-assessed health is an unbiased
indicator of the DI Administration’s award decisions in the US cannot be rejected.
Here, we come to a rather different conclusion regarding misreporting in register data,
since unemployment increases the probability of an official classification as disabled.
Another related study is Baker et al. (2004), in which medical reports are used as the
benchmark and related to “objective, self-reported” measures, i.e., survey reports of
the incidence of chronic ailments. The evidence indicates that the latter are measured
with considerable error. Like our study, Cullen (2003) raises the issue whether register
data on disability are reliable, but in a different context. She argues that school districts
in the US have financial incentives to classify students as disabled. The results suggest
that disability rates increase in the generosity of reimbursements. Our work also relates
to other studies that consider the reliability of register data concerning, e.g., education
(Fitzenberger et al. 2006) and earnings (Kapteyn and Ypma 2007).
The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 discusses the incentives to misreport
in the disability classifications at the PES, while Sect. 3 describes the data. The econometric framework is spelled out in Sect. 4. The results from the estimations are
presented in Sect. 5 and a conclusion is given in Sect. 6.

2 Incentives to misreport disability at the PES
Since the various problems associated with self-reported data on health have already
been discussed extensively in the literature, we focus our attention on the reasons

123

as to why the official PES classifications may be biased. To this end, it is useful to
consider objectives and administrative processes at the PES offices. These offices are
part of the National Labour Market Administration (Arbetsmarknadsverket). Besides
providing employment services, the PES offices make decisions about placements in
active labour market programmes. Some of these programmes are designed exclusively
for the work disabled. The two largest such programmes are subsidised employment
(lönebidrag) and sheltered employment, of which Samhall, a state-owned company,
is the main provider (Bergeskog 2001).
A classification as work disabled is necessary for participation in a programme for
the work disabled. Otherwise, the procedures regarding disability classifications are
not strictly regulated, leaving some scope for the individual judgement of the PES
officials (SOU 2003:95). If the jobseeker has a disability that is readily apparent to
the PES official, or if a doctor’s certificate is presented by the jobseeker, the coding
may take place at the beginning of the registration period. In most cases, though,
the coding is likely to take some time. This may be due to administrative inertia, as
the PES official collects information about the jobseeker and possibly arranges for
a medical examination, which may involve some waiting time. It may also be the
case that the coding is initiated in connection with a discussion of placement in a
labour market programme for the disabled, which typically occurs only after a long
period of registration. If an individual is classified as work disabled at the PES, it does
not necessarily follow that the individual will always be. Changes in classifications,
both from disabled to non-disabled and from non-disabled to disabled, are frequent
(Skedinger and Widerstedt 2007).
It is not unlikely that changes in labour market policy during the 1990s have had
repercussions on the coding of disability at the PES. In 1996, the Government introduced a goal to halve open unemployment by 2000. At the same time, target levels for the
number of persons in labour market programmes were announced. These quantitative
goals represent a substantial departure from the traditional policy, which allowed more
freedom for the PES offices in the choice of measures for reducing unemployment.
It has been argued that the strong focus on the open-unemployment goal implies an
obvious risk that active labour market programmes mainly serve as a means of reducing
open unemployment (Nyberg and Skedinger 1998; Zetterberg 1997).
There are various quantitative targets that apply to programmes for the disabled.
Thus officials at the PES offices may have incentives to classify healthy jobseekers as
disabled. On the one hand, there are targets that should directly affect the number of
individuals classified as disabled. On the other hand, there are targets that are likely
to have indirect effects.
The quantitative goals regarding placements in subsidised employment may be
regarded as direct goals. During the period 1997–2002, the target volumes, which are
specified as monthly averages and broken down by region, have increased from 50,000
to 59,000 individuals, according to the Government’s annual regulatory guidelines
(regleringsbrev) for the National Labour Market Administration. There are also targets
regarding the average level of subsidisation in these jobs. The targets have decreased
from 60 to less than 58% of total pay during the same period (the remainder being paid
by the employer). Quantitative targets like these may put pressure on PES officials
to lower the threshold for disability classifications, since this increases the supply of

123

eligible workers and also makes employers more willing to accept a candidate for a
subsidised job. It is also possible that misreporting at the PES depends on the degree
by which a PES agency in a region meets the targets set by the central policy makers.
The targets operating in a more indirect way concern placements of unemployed
workers in regular jobs. These goals can be more easily achieved by placing individuals
with low qualifications in subsidised jobs for disabled workers.
Funding for subsidised employment is distributed according to “resource allocation models” (resursfördelningsmodeller). One model applies to allocation from the
National Labour Market Board to the County Labour Boards (länsarbetsnämnder)
and each board uses a model for allocation to the PES offices. Allocation to the PES
offices—but not to the boards—is in part dependent on the caseload of disabled jobseekers. This may create incentives at the local level to classify healthy individuals as
disabled.
Healthy jobseekers may also have incentives to be classified as disabled, as such
a classification is a requirement for placements in subsidised employment and these
jobs may represent an attractive option. In sheltered employment, average wages are
slightly lower than the industry average but higher than unemployment benefits. The
reduced work pace may make effort-adjusted wages attractive for more productive (and
possibly non-disabled) workers (Haavisto et al. 1993). The presence of non-disabled
employees in sheltered employment is documented in Skedinger and Widerstedt
(2007). In addition, there is a high degree of employment security in sheltered employment, since employees are not laid off in response to declining demand as could be
the case in a regular job. Thus there is a distinct possibility that such programmes are
used for income support in ways not originally intended.
The discussion above suggests that the official measure of health we use may be
biased for various reasons. There is also reason to believe that the classification errors
are systematically related to unemployment. Next we turn to a description of the
sample.

3 The data
This study uses individual-level data matched from two sources: The HÄNDEL events
database from the PES offices, compiled by the National Labour Market Board (Arbetsmarknadsstyrelsen), and the LFS, of Statistics Sweden.
The PES data contain information on the incidence and type of work disability,
reported by the PES office and this is the official measure of health we use. Our selfreported data originate from the LFS, in which the respondents are asked whether
they consider themselves disabled, and if so, whether the capacity to work is reduced.
There are also questions about the type of disability. Thus for each individual in the
sample we have one self-reported and one register data observation on disability status.
However, we have information on the severity of the disability only in the surveys.
There may be different thresholds for disability classifications in the two data sources.
In the LFS, it is possible that respondents define the reduction of work capacity only
in relation to a current and/or previous job and do not recognise the potential to adjust,
with proper training and rehabilitation, to a new job. These possibilities should be

123

taken into account in the classifications at the PES. (Further details on the definitions
of disability in the two sources are presented in an appendix to the working paper
version of this article, see Johansson and Skedinger 2005).
The LFS have been conducted by telephone each month since 1970. We use the
surveys carried out during the fourth quarters in 1996, 1998 and 2000, which were
supplemented with questions about health status. The LFS samples are repeated random cross-sections of about 18,000 individuals in the resident population between 16
and 64 years of age. This data set has been matched with the PES data, which contains
information about every individual registered at the PES offices. We have information
about each spell for individuals registered as jobseekers during the period 1991–2002,
including background characteristics such as work disability. The matched data set
can be regarded as a basically random sample of job-seeking individuals registered at
the PES offices in 1996, 1998 or 2000, but not as a random sample of individuals in
general.
A registration period in the PES data ends as the individual finds a regular job or
leaves the labour force. An individual may have several such periods. The registration
period may consist of a series of search category periods, in, e.g., open unemployment
or a labour market programme. Work disability is registered at some point of time
during a search period. Thus if an individual has many search periods, the disability
classification may change during the registration period.
Our sample consists of 53,736 individuals in total. For various reasons a number
of individuals had to be excluded, leaving us with sample of 44,532 individuals.2 The
sample thus consists of individuals with PES spells during the period 1991 to 2002,
who were also in 1996, 1998 or 2000 interviewed about health status in the LFS.3
Sample characteristics are reported in Table 1, which shows disability and other
characteristics for individuals in our LFS sample, i.e., individuals who at some time
during 1991–2002 have been registered as jobseekers. On average, about 7.9% of the
respondents in LFS report a work disability, while 5.5 and 2.7% classify themselves
as partially and highly work disabled, respectively. The incidence of overall work
disability has been relatively stable over time, while the highly work disabled category
has increased somewhat across surveys.
Table 1 also includes data on disability characteristics for a sub-sample of individuals with contemporaneous information on work disability in the unemployment
register. We have constructed a 6-month long “window”—3 months before and after
a survey, assuming it takes place in the middle of the fourth quarter, i.e., November—
which means that the register information dates from a point in time that is at most
3 months away from the survey (although we experiment with longer time lengths later

2 The following individuals were excluded, in order of exclusion: 1,725 with incorrect or missing dates for
PES registration; 2,341 below the age of 18 at time of LFS; 2,509 with first PES registration before 1991
(the information regarding unemployment history is less reliable for individuals registered before 1991);
1,933 with first PES registration later than 2001; 538 with disability pension before first PES registration;
148 who emigrated before first PES registration; 10 with old age pension before first PES registration.
3 It should be noted that 9,919 individuals, out of the 44,532, had at least one spell as either part-time
unemployed or full-time employed looking for a new job, i.e., all their PES spells were not spent in open
unemployment or programme activity.

Individuals in the supplementary LFS 1996, 1998 and 2000; means
a Information available within a period of 3 months before and after a LFS

in the analysis). Such a window is available for about half the sample.4 Individuals
recently registered by the PES as looking for a job tend to report disability to about
the same extent as others in the LFS, but the incidence of more severe work disability
is somewhat higher.5 Table 1 shows that more persons regard themselves as work
disabled in the LFS than are classified as such at the PES (4.7%). This should also be
expected as the definition of disability seems to be stricter at the PES.
It is also seen in Table 1 that the average number of months of previous unemployment increases over subsequent surveys. This may be explained by selection effects;
the later one is sampled in the LFS, the longer one may have been registered as
unemployed in the PES data since 1991. Since the unemployment rate decreases over
the sample period, the later samples contain fewer, and presumably less employable,
individuals.
The cross-tabulations of work disability in LFS and PES reveal that classifications,
by and large, match quite well. About 90% are classified in the same way—work disabled or not work disabled—in both sources.6 However, there are discrepancies worth
noting. Almost 6% of the individuals report a work disability in LFS, while having no
such classification in PES. A potential explanation, besides changing health between
measurement dates, is that the definition of work disability used in the unemployment
register is stricter than the one used by self-reporting individuals.7 For instance it may
well be the case that survey respondents tend to consider work capacity only in the
current or previous job, while PES officials should also take potential future occupations into account. Another possibility, however, is that fear of stigmatisation causes
jobseekers to decline a classification as disabled at the PES, while more anonymity
is provided in the LFS. Almost 3% declare themselves not to be work disabled, but
are classified as such in the unemployment register. For this type of discrepancy, it is
4 The windows sample is less representative of jobseekers than the larger sample. This is because individuals

with long periods are over-sampled in the windows sample.
5 In the PES data, virtually all observations on disability are missing values. These have been set to zero
by us.
6 The high match rate is, however, driven by the fact that the typical jobseeker is not disabled.
7 Under the reasonable assumption that changes in health between measurements in the LFS and the PES

are random, these changes should explain equally much of the two types of discrepancy [“work disabled
(LFS) + not work disabled (PES)” and “not work disabled (LFS) + work disabled (PES)”]. Under the
additional assumption that changes in health account for all of the last-mentioned type of discrepancy, we
are left with at least 5.7 − 2.5 = 3.2% unexplained discrepancy in the first type according to Table 1.

123

Misreporting in register data on disability status

419

conceivable that intentional misreporting of disability status (in PES) is involved, as
discussed previously.
Table 1 also includes some background characteristics of the sample, regarding
age, gender, education, as well as family and labour market status and region of birth.
Further details on disability characteristics are presented in Johansson and Skedinger
(2005).
In the econometric analyses we use the window sample, i.e., in which health information in the PES and LFS is recorded within a period of 6 months. Unemployment
is measured in months and includes participation in labour market programmes. The
period of measurement is from 1991 up to, but not including, the current search category period. The classification error PES–LFS constitutes the dependent variable in
our analysis. It takes on the values −1 (the individual is classified as work disabled
in the LFS, but not at the PES), 0 (classifications agree) and 1 (no work disability
classification in the LFS, but at the PES).
4 Econometric framework
In this section, we put more structure on the problem whether data on disability are
reliable. Our focus is on register data and we discuss the possibility of testing if such
data are distorted by misreporting. To be specific, we consider whether the individual’s
unemployment history, given health status, affects the disability classification. This
represents a systematic classification error.
For pedagogical reasons we first discuss our modeling framework by using the
potential outcomes set-up (cf. Rubin 1973a,b; Neyman 1990). In analogy with this
literature, we regard unemployment as the “treatment” and the PES and LFS disability classification as the outcomes of this “treatment”. We define unemployment as a
dichotomous variable: U = 1 if the individual is unemployed and U = 0 if he or she
is employed.8 Later on we extend this framework when unemployment (or treatment)
is an ordered variable.
Let D(1) be the work disability classification at the PES if the individual is unemployed and let D(0) be the classification for the same individual if he or she is
employed. The average treatment effect of unemployment on disability classification
is then equal to
d = E(D(1) − D(0)) = E(δ d ),
where δ d is the treatment effect of the individual and E is the mathematical expectation
with respect to the job-seeking population. There are reasons to believe that unemployment affects health9 and also the disability classification. Hence, in the absence of
misreporting at the PES, d is a measure of the average health effect of unemployment
on disability. Now, let S(1) be the LFS classification if the individual is unemployed
8 Note that jobseekers registered at the PES may be employed.
9 See, e.g., Björklund (1985); Gerdtham and Johannesson (2003), and Hamilton et al. (1997). Regarding

health effects of economic conditions in general, see, e.g., Ruhm (2000, 2003).

123

and let S(0) be the classification for the same individual if he or she is employed. The
average treatment effect of unemployment on disability classification in the LFS is
then equal to
s = E(S(1) − S(0)) = E(δ s ),
where δ s is the individual’s treatment effect.
Our interest is to estimate the average misreporting in the population, which is
defined as
m = d − s = E (D(1) − D(0) − [S(1) − S(0)])
= E(δ d − δ s ).

(1)

As discussed in Sect. 2, there may be incentives (both for jobseekers and officials) to
overreport disability at the PES. These particular incentives should not exist in the LFS.
Nevertheless, δ d and δ s may both be distorted due to justification, i.e., unemployed
jobseekers may, for psychological reasons, overreport disability in the LFS and this
self-assessed health may also influence the classifications made by PES officials. It is
assumed that such justification, if it exists, does not influence PES classifications more
than reporting in the LFS. Under this assumption, d > s implies misreporting due
to incentives at the PES.
For individuals with U = 1, we observe D = D(1) and S = S(1), while for
individuals with U = 0, D = D(0) and S = S(0) are observed. Thus we cannot
observe δ d and δ s . Empirical identification of d and s requires strong assumptions.
For instance, in order to estimate the effects of unemployment on disability, we need
to assume that the unemployed had the same health status as the employed before
becoming unemployed. This is a strong assumption even if we have good conditioning
variables. However, we do not need to identify d and s in order to identify m .
This follows since Eq. 1 can be written as
m = E (D(1) − S(1) − [D(0) − S(0)]) .

(2)

Here D(U ) − S(U ), where U = 0 and 1, is the individual’s difference in disability classification if he or she is employed or unemployed, respectively. It is shown
in the Appendix that the classification errors stemming from different self-assessed
thresholds across individuals are small and, in most realistic settings, difference out.
As discussed in Sect. 3, there are various reasons why S(U ), and D(U ), U = 0 and
1, may differ in levels also at the individual level: different thresholds for assessing
work capacity reduction (including the possibility of more fear of stigmatisation at the
PES than in the LFS) and S(U ) being classified at three levels and D(U ) at two (see
Table 1).
The implication of (2) is that m is identified if the distribution of PES–LFS differences is the same for the unemployed and the employed. The unemployed have
less education and it is conceivable that this reduces their capacity to assess their own
health. It is still possible to identify m if we can control for the potential difference

123

in this capacity (which we do by including variables for education and citizenship in
the empirical analysis).
Let D(0) − S(0) = δ0 + ε, δ d = d + ηd and δ s = s + ηs . Without loss of
generality the estimation problem can then be formulated as an empirical regression
model with i = 1, . . ., n sampled individuals, hence
Di − Si = (Di (0) − Si (0)) + Ui (δid − δis ) + εi
= δ0 + Ui m + ωi ,
i = 1, . . . , n,

(3)

where ωi = Ui (ηid − ηis ) + εi is the heteroskedastic error.10 We assume ηid and ηis
are both independent of Ui . This assumption is valid if individuals do not select into
unemployment because of a larger probability to be classified as disabled when being
unemployed than when being employed, which we find highly unlikely. Thus, the
key to consistently estimate misreporting (due to incentives at the PES) is that εi is
not systematically different for the employed and unemployed populations. εi is the
individual PES–LFS difference to be classified as disabled if he or she is employed. If
the unemployed have less capacity to assess their own health than do the employed,
εi will be correlated with Ui . This would yield biased estimates of m when (3) is
estimated using the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator. In order to remove this
potential source of bias we add covariates (X ) that measure the capacity to assess the
health in the regression model, hence
Di − Si = δ0 + Ui m + X i β + ζi ,

(4)

where ζi , by the assumptions discussed above, is a regression error, that is uncorrelated
with both Ui and K control variables X i .
We actually have more information on unemployment than just whether the individuals are unemployed or not: the length of U in months is observed. Thus “treatment” is
observed at different “dosage” levels, which yields additional testable hypotheses and
puts our theory to a stricter test. First, if there is a “treatment effect” it should be monotonic, i.e., a larger “dose” of unemployment (in months) causes the mean difference
between the PES and LFS classifications to increase, for all values of unemployment.
Arguably, the PES officials should have greater incentives to classify the long-term
unemployed as disabled than those with less joblessness. The observed outcomes with
unemployment measured in months can be written as

any assumptions regarding functional form. (When control variables are added, the

the next section where we discuss the results.

5 Econometric results
In this section, we present analyses of the relationship between unemployment and
disability classifications. We start with a simple bivariate analysis and then run multivariate regressions under different assumptions regarding the functional form of the
effects of the covariates.
In Fig. 1, the bivariate relationships between accumulated unemployment and disability classifications in the data are presented. Panel a shows a simple scatter plot,
where the individuals have been classified into groups depending on the number of
months in unemployment.12 Panel b is a bivariate regression of the same relationships
11 The additive model is estimated by recursive backfitting, see Hastie and Tibshirani (1990) for details.

The linear regression model is estimated by OLS. In the inference we take into account potential heteroskedasticity by using a robust covariance matrix.
12 The individuals in Fig. 1a are classified into G groups, depending on unemployment history, according

to
Ug = u g I(ag ≤ u i < ag+1 ), g = 1, . . ., G,
where u g is accumulated unemployment in class g. The class interval is determined by ag and ag+1 , where
a1 = 0. We calculate the proportion of work disabled in the sample according to the PES (P) and LFS (L)
definitions for each interval, as follows

work disabled is visible. Obviously, this pattern may be due to lower job-finding
probabilities among the disabled, but also, as discussed previously, state dependence
(including adverse effects of unemployment on health) or stigmatisation, so we are not
identifying any causal effects in the figures. However, their most interesting feature
is that the probability to be classified as work disabled at the PES is increasing more
strongly in months of unemployment than the corresponding probability in the LFS.
This might indicate misreporting. It is also noteworthy that the slopes of the partially
and highly disabled in the LFS do not differ significantly from each other, i.e., the
individuals are not more likely to self-report a severe, rather than a less severe, disability as more unemployment is accumulated. We interpret this as mild evidence that
unemployment does not contribute disproportionately to more severe health problems.
We now turn to the regressions. First, separate OLS regressions are run for the
probability of being classified as work disabled at the PES or in the LFS (either
partially or highly), respectively. The results from these estimations are displayed
in Table 2. In addition to unemployment history, variables for age, gender, level of
education, number of children, region of birth and the year in which the LFS was
conducted are included in all models.
Let us first look at the coefficients of the control variables in the separate regressions
for the PES and LFS. The probability of a disability classification increases with
age, but at a decreasing rate. Individuals with more education are less likely to be
classified as work disabled. Family attachments also seem to matter; being married or
cohabitating and, mainly in the PES data, having children are associated with a lower
probability of a disability classification. These results largely conform to findings
in previous studies. Region of birth comes out insignificantly in most cases, with
some exceptions, notably some non-European categories in the LFS. The negative
coefficients for those individuals may be explained by, e.g., selection effects (having
a disability makes migration difficult) or language difficulties.
What about unemployment, then? An increase in the number of months in unemployment is clearly associated with a higher probability to be classified as work disabled. The two coefficients—both strongly significant—are 0.0025 and 0.0013 in the
PES and the LFS, respectively. An increase in unemployment of, say, 10 months is
thus associated with an increase in the likelihood of a disability classification with 2.5
percentage points at the PES and 1.3 points in the LFS.
We now turn to our most interesting results, namely the estimations of misreporting,
corresponding to the framework in Sect. 4. Regression models of the difference in
classifications, assuming constant marginal effects as in Eq. 6, are estimated by OLS.
We also run additive regression models, which leave the functional form of the effects
from the covariates unspecified (see e.g., Hastie and Tibshirani 1990). As in Eq. 5,
marginal effects are assumed not to be constant in the additive regressions.
The rightmost part of Table 2 shows the regression with the PES–LFS difference in
disability classifications. As mentioned in Sect. 3, the dependent variable takes on the
values −1, 0 and 1. Many of the coefficients that were significant in the separate regressions, e.g., for age, education and children, are now rendered insignificant. However,
two of the coefficients for foreign-born individuals (Europe excluding EU 15 and Asia)
remain significant and come out with a positive sign, i.e., a disability classification
is more likely at the PES than in the LFS. Most importantly, unemployment retains

strong significance, with a coefficient of 0.0012. So an individual with 10 months of
previous unemployment is about 1 percentage point more likely to be classified as
work disabled at the PES, but not in the LFS, than if the individual had no previous
unemployment. This can be compared to the overall probability to be classified as
work disabled at the PES, which is 5% (see Table 1). Thus, on average, there is a
20% increase in the likelihood of this type of classification error with each 10-month
increase in unemployment. The misreporting we have detected in the data is thus not
negligible.

The results in the PES–LFS regression in Table 2 lend support to the hypothesis
that there are incentives to misreport disability at the PES. We argue that a causal
interpretation of the relationship between unemployment and disability classification
is justified here, unlike in the two separate regressions.13 In Sect. 4 we discussed the
potential problem with unobservables. It was argued that unemployed individuals may
have a lower capacity to assess their own health than employed persons. The inclusion
of education and citizenship as controls should alleviate this potential problem.
We now turn to the more flexible specification, namely the additive model.14 Unlike
in the the linear regression model, the functional form of the continuous variables is
not assumed to be known in advance. For the variables unemployment and age, loess
smoothers (locally weighted running-line smoother with bandwidth 4/3) are used. The
presentation of the regression results is limited to these two continuous variables and
is in visual form only. For computational convenience, the relationships between the
dependent and independent variables are evaluated with all other covariates, including
the intercept, set to zero. As a consequence, the probability predictions in the figures
may, without loss of generality, be negative.
Figures 2 and 3 show the additive regression results for PES and LFS separately.
Figure 2 suggests a linear relationship between unemployment and work disability
at the PES. An approximate F test (see Hastie and Tibshirani 1990 for details) for
13 It should be noted that the possible existence of a waiting period before a disability classification
(discussed in Sect. 2), does not cause identification problems in our analysis. This is because inertia of this
type should not result in truly disabled individuals classifying themselves as not disabled in the LFS, for
any length of unemployment.
14 The estimation is based on the local scoring algorithm, which iteratively fits weighted additive models
by backfitting. The backfitting algorithm is a Gauss–Seidel method for fitting additive models, by iteratively
smoothing partial residuals.

linearity gives that linearity cannot be rejected (P value 0.44). The corresponding
estimates for self-assessed work disability in the LFS are presented in Fig. 3, where
the relationship is less linear than in the previous figure. Although there is a tendency
for a convex shape, linearity cannot be rejected at standard levels (P value 0.054). This
is due to the lack of precision at the right end in the graph.

only previous unemployment is regressed on the PES–LFS difference, while Fig. 5
shows the results when we have included control variables. In Fig. 4, the gradient of
unemployment is positive and almost linear. There is some concavity after 60 months
of unemployment. However, the non-linearity is not statistically significant (P value
0.14). In Fig. 5, the effect of unemployment on the dependent variable is basically
the same as with no controls added (linearity is now rejected with an 18% risk).
Adding controls apparently does little to change the effect of unemployment on the
PES–LFS difference. As in Table 2, the correlation between unemployment and the
PES–LFS difference in Fig. 5 clearly indicates that there is misclassification due
to incentives to misreport disability at the PES. The difference is initially negative
if being unemployed for less than 18 months and then positive. Under the extreme
assumption that the unobserved thresholds15 for work disability classification at the
PES and in the LFS are the same, all of the initial negative effect, up to 18 months
of unemployment, is attributable to stigmatisation (correlated with unemployment).
Under the more realistic assumption that the threshold is lower for the self-reported
measure than for PES classifications, this stigmatisation effect should be very small
or absent.16
What about the magnitude of the effects shown in Figs. 4 and 5? An individual with
70 months of previous unemployment is about 7 percentage points more likely to be
classified as work disabled at the PES, but not in the LFS, than an individual with no
15 The average PES–LFS “classification error”, using the overall work disability measure in the LFS, is
−3.1% = 4.7 − 7.8% (see Table 1).
16 The average PES–LFS “classification error” using the highly work disabled in the LFS is 2.6%, according
to Table 1. With the stricter LFS disability classification the resulting graph looks exactly the same as the
one in Fig. 5. However, the difference becomes strictly larger than zero, so if stigmatisation correlated with
unemployment exists it is very low or non-existing for this sample.

123

Misreporting in register data on disability status

429

unemployment. The corresponding effect in Table 1 is about 8 percentage points, so,
in this range of unemployment, the difference is not great across estimation methods.
If self-assessed work disability, like the official measure, is affected by justification
of unemployment, average misreporting (δ m ) does not capture the full extent of systematic classification errors due to unemployment. In this case, the estimated effects
rather represent a lower bound of this classification error.
5.1 Robustness checks
As mentioned in Sect. 4, the misreporting effects are no longer non-parametrically
identified when control variables are added to the model. However, we have performed
various robustness tests of the PES–LFS difference regressions in Table 2 and Fig. 5,
the full details of which are available from the authors on request. All models and
estimators result in the same conclusions. See (i–vi) below.
(i) Municipal fixed effects were introduced in the regressions. This procedure is
likely to pick up influences from the local labour market, since differences across
regions in this respect tend to be permanent over time. The results from the fixed
effects specification were very similar to previous findings.
(ii) We experimented with increasing the window length from 6 to 12 months. The
number of observations increased to 23,178, but the results remained unchanged.
(iii) Non-Nordic-born individuals were excluded from the sample, in order to check
whether the results regarding the unemployment effect are explained by language
difficulties. It is conceivable that some non-Nordic-born do not fully understand
the interview questions posed in the LFS and thus understate true health status,
while this is less likely to occur at the PES, where contact is repeated and interpreter services may be available. We estimated the model excluding the 3,121
individuals born outside of the Nordic countries, but this did not change the
results.
(iv) The additive regression results are robust with respect to the choice of bandwidth.
We have estimated all such models with spans ranging from 1/2 to 11/2. We have
also estimated generalised additive models, with a logit link, for the PES and LFS
disability classifications (but not for PES–LFS difference). The results from these
models are in agreement with the findings from the additive model.
(v) It may be the case that individuals condition survey responses on previous information from external sources and it was explored whether this affects the results.
In our case, the responses in the LFS may be influenced by a PES classification occurring before the survey. For example, if our findings are explained by
unemployed individuals in bad health systematically exaggerating their working
capacity, while PES officials provide correct information, one should expect that
the jobseekers revise their opinion after receiving a classification at the PES.
In order to perform this test, it was necessary to redefine the sample, creating clearcut limits between periods in which the LFS and PES classifications, respectively,
may have occurred. We thus used a sample of 7,026 individuals who have a
spell of unemployment in the period 6 months before or after the LFS, but were
not unemployed at all after or before the LFS. There are 5,191 individuals who

123

430

P. Johansson, P. Skedinger

have such a spell prior to the LFS and who were not unemployed post-LFS and
there are 1,835 individuals who were not unemployed before the LFS but had an
unemployment spell after the LFS. On this sample, of 7,026 individuals in total,
an ordered logit regression model using the LFS classification (S = 0, 1, 2) as
the dependent variable and the PES classification and a dummy variable for a
spell prior to the LFS was estimated. The coefficient for the post-LFS dummy
variable turned out to be insignificant (P value 0.85), suggesting that conditioning
of survey responses on official classifications is not a problem in our analysis.
(vi) Experiments were performed with more traditional non-linear models, with unemployment grouped into intervals as described in footnote 12. These logit and ordered logit regressions did not alter the basic conclusions of our previous exercises.
6 Conclusions
The issue considered in this study is whether there is systematic misreporting in
register data on disability status. While there is a rather large literature on the reliability
of self-reported disability, evidence regarding register data is scant. It seems to be
widely believed among researchers that, since individuals out of work are inclined to
respond towards poor health, it would be best to have official data provided by the
relevant administrative bodies (like the DI administration or the PES). At the same
time, other researchers have pointed out that some European countries may mask
high levels of unemployment by classifying healthy individuals as disabled instead of
unemployed (see, e.g., Haveman et al. 1984). The purpose of this paper is to contribute
to this discussion by providing evidence, based on individual data, regarding systematic
misreporting of this kind.
The main message of our paper is that register data should be regarded with some
suspicion, even if work capacity is taken into account in the data, since the administrators also have incentives to misreport. This is because the PES officials have quantitative targets regarding the placement of individuals in subsidised jobs and because
the officials may be influenced by jobseekers who want to be labelled as disabled.
Our findings should shed additional light on the distinction between, and usefulness
of, self-reported and official health measures as they are defined in the literature. The
results suggest the presence of incentive problems in disability classification procedures at the PES.17 Furthermore, the sources of error we find are akin to the moral
hazard effect discussed in the literature on DI and other types of social insurance.18
For a large sample of Swedish jobseekers, we have contrasted register data with
self-reported measures on health status, for the same individuals, from the LFS. The
econometric analysis shows that the difference in the categorical disability classifi17 Examples of incentive problems for administrators at the PES can be found also for other countries.
In the “Vermittlungsskandal” (placement scandal) in Germany in 2001, it was revealed that job placement
statistics were manipulated on a large scale by administrators (Federal Ministry of Economics and Labour
2003).

cation between the PES and the self-reported LFS increases in accumulated unemployment of the individual. This result, which indicates misreporting in the official
data, is robust to various experiments regarding estimation methods, control variables
and subgroups. We find that misreporting increases monotonically in the length of
“treatment”, e.g., unemployment, and this information could be useful for reducing
the classification error in disability data.
It should be noted that our definition of misreporting may be different from the
one that is used internally at the PES. An internal document at the National Labour
Market Board contains the following passage: “It is only after having mapped out and
assessed the functional impairment in relation to the labour market and the labour
supply of the jobseeker that one can determine whether a work disability exists” (Ams
1999, p. 6, our translation and italics). A possible interpretation of these guidelines is
that using unemployment in order to screen for health is permitted. Furthermore, the
rules are very clear as regards the right of individuals to deny a disability classification,
which, in contrast, leads to underreporting of impairments according to our definition.
We believe that our results should have implications also for the reliability of other
official measures. If these measures are also influenced by the incentives of the persons
making the classifications and the incentives of the individuals being classified, the
absence of systematic misreporting should not be taken for granted. Institutional details
of the classification procedures and empirical evidence supporting the validity need to
be considered as well. For example, using register data from the DI administration as a
benchmark for evaluating the reliability of self-assessed health could be misleading to
the extent that the official data contain systematic errors. It is important to keep in mind
that both self-assessed and official data on health may be influenced by incentives and,
if so, the types of incentives involved are likely to differ between the two measures.
An interesting area for future research is to estimate true health, which is unobserved, when both available classifications (administrative and self-assessed) are influenced by systematic misreporting. In order to recover true health in such structural
models, in which a latent index crossing a threshold determines the classification,
we need two “instruments”: one variable that, ceteris paribus, affects the individual’s
incentives (threshold) to classify himself or herself as disabled and another variable
that affects the officials’ incentives (threshold) to classify the individual as disabled
but not the individual’s self-assessed health.

where I (.) is the indicator function and the thresholds are allowed to vary between
the classifications (d and s) and labor market status ( j = 1, 0). In addition, the health
status is allowed to be dependent on the labour market status. The subjective threshold
j
j
can be written td = ts + c j , where we assume c0 ≥ 0. The individuals’ thresholds
for self-assessed disability classification are in general (if not unemployed) lower than
the thresholds at the PES, due to fear of stigmatisation at the PES. The individual
probability to be classified as disabled is thus governed by the probability distribution
j
of health shocks given the thresholds and health. Hence E(S( j)) = G(h j − td − c j ),
where G is the distribution function for the health shocks.
We then get

When the higher order terms are small in comparison to the first derivative they can
be neglected and hence the classification errors stemming from different self-assessed
thresholds are differenced out. Since c0 ≥ 0 for all individuals we get
E(D(0) − S(0) ≤ 0
if c0 ≥ c1 . Furthermore, we have
E(D(1) − S(1)) − D(0) − S(0)) > 0.
