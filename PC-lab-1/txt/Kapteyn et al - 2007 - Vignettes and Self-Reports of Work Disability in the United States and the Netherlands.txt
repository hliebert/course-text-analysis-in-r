Vignettes and Self-Reports of Work Disability in the United
States and the Netherlands
By ARIE KAPTEYN, JAMES P. SMITH,
High and rising rates of work disability are a
pervasive problem in many industrialized countries (see Robert Haveman and Barbara Wolfe
2000; John Bound and Richard Burkhauser
1999). The fraction of workers reporting work
disability is vastly different across countries
with similar levels of economic development
and comparable access to modern medical technology and treatment. Institutional differences
in eligibility rules or generosity of benefits no
doubt explain part of the differences in disability rolls (see Bound and Burkhauser 1999;
Burkhauser and Mary Daly 2002; Thomas DeLeire 2000). Recent survey data show, however,
that significant differences between countries
are also found in self-reports of work-limiting
disabilities. In comparing such self-reports, a
basic question concerns the extent to which
people living in the same or in different countries use the same response scales when they
answer questions about work disability. If they
use the same scales, differences in reported
work disability reflect true differences across
countries in disabilities affecting work. But if
response scales differ systematically, adjustments must be made before conclusions about
international differences in true work disability
can be drawn.
The paper puts forth a new approach to the
measurement of work disability. We utilize a
vignette methodology to evaluate how people
within and across countries set thresholds that
result in labeling some people work disabled
while other people are not so described. Our

vignette questions ask respondents to evaluate,
on the same scale on which they evaluate themselves, the severity of work disability problems
of hypothetical scenarios and people.1
While we use vignettes for work disability,
our methodology applies to many economic applications with subjective scales. Gary King’s
Web site (http://gking.harvard.edu/vign/eg/)
lists vignettes pertaining to a variety of domains, including health, health care, school
community strength, HIV risk, state effectiveness, and corruption. Within economics, one
could use vignettes to address differences in
perceptions of risk, opinions about income inequality and poverty, workload and pay, valuation of the quality of public services, etc.
This research performs an international comparison of two countries: the United States and
the Netherlands. These countries differ in several relevant dimensions— observed rates of
self-reported work disability, the generosity of
government programs providing income support for people with a work disability, and perhaps national norms about the appropriateness
of not working when work disabled (see Leo
Aarts et al. 1996). But one might reasonably
suspect that these two countries differ less in the
“objectively” measured health status of the population. For this reason, we believe that this
international comparison is particularly useful
in understanding the salient research issues that
have dominated the scientific literature on work
disability.
A unique aspect of the research is that we
address these issues in a classic random experimental form. This is because we have access to
Internet samples in both countries allowing us
to place experimental disability vignette modules into these panels. These samples are the
Dutch CentERpanel and the RAND MS Internet

panel for the United States, both described in
detail below.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section I, we describe the vignette methodology
and our statistical model, which corrects for
response scale differences across countries.
Section II briefly discusses our data and some
measurement issues, and presents descriptive
statistics on self-reported work limitations in
the United States and the Netherlands. Section III presents the empirical results and their
implications for interpreting observed differences in work disabilities. Conclusions follow
in Section IV.
I. The Vignette Methodology

A. The Intuition about Vignettes
In this section, we provide an intuitive description of the use of vignettes for identifying
response scale differences, and then sketch our
statistical approach. The basic idea is illustrated
in Figure 1, which presents the distribution of
health in two hypothetical countries. The density of the continuous health variable in country
A is to the left of that in country B, implying
that, on average, people in country A are less
healthy than those in country B. The people in
the two countries, however, use very different
response scales if asked to report their health on
a five-point scale (poor, fair, good, very good,
excellent). In this figure, people in country A
have a much more positive view of a given
health status than people in country B. Someone
in country A with health indicated by the dashed
line would report to be in very good health,
while a person in country B with the same
actual health would report “fair.” The frequency
distribution of self-reports in the two countries
would suggest that people in country A are
healthier than those in country B—the opposite
of the true health distribution. Correcting for
differences in the response scales (DIF, “differential item functioning,” in the terminology
of Gary King et al. 2004) is essential to compare the actual health distributions in the two
countries.
Vignettes can be used to do the correction. A
vignette question describes the health of a hypothetical person and then asks the respondent
to evaluate that person’s health on the same
scale used for a self-report on their own health.

MARCH 2007

Since vignette descriptions are the same, vignette persons in the two countries have the
same actual health. For example, respondents
can be asked to evaluate the health of a person
whose health is given by the dashed line. In
country A, this will be evaluated as “very
good.” In country B, the evaluation would be
“fair.” Since actual health is the same in the two
countries, differences in country evaluations
must be due to DIF.
Vignette evaluations thus help to identify the
differences between the response scales. Using
scales in one country as the benchmark, the
distribution of evaluations in the other country
can be adjusted by evaluating on the benchmark
scale. The corrected distribution can be compared to that in the benchmark country— both
are on the same scale. In the example in the
figure, this leads to the correct conclusion that
people in country B are healthier than those in
country A, on average. The underlying assumption is response consistency: each respondent
uses the same scale for the self-report and the
vignette evaluations. King et al. (2004) provide
evidence supporting this assumption by comparing self-reports of vision corrected and not
corrected for DIF using vignette evaluations
with an objective measure of vision.
We will apply the vignette approach to worklimiting disability, using vignettes to obtain not
only international comparisons corrected for
DIF, but also comparisons of different groups
within a given country. For example, it is often
hypothesized that men report themselves in better health than objective circumstances would
warrant, that as they age people adjust their
norms about what constitutes good health
downward, and that some of the socioeconomic
status (SES) health gradient reflects different
health thresholds by SES rather than true health
differences. Vignettes offer the potential for
systematic testing of these hypotheses.
B. Formal Model with Vignettes on Work
Limiting Disability
Our model explains respondents’ self-reports
on work limitations and their reports on work
limitations of hypothetical vignette persons.
The first of these is the answer, on a five-point
scale (Yri for respondent i), to the question: “Do
you have any impairment or health problem that
limits the kind or amount of paid work you can

respondent characteristics Xi (including a country dummy and interactions with that dummy)
and an error term ␧ri by the following ordered
response equation:

ui⬃N(0, ␴2u), ui independent of Xi and the other
error terms in the model. The fact that different
respondents use different response scales ␶ ji is
called DIF. The term ui introduces an unobserved individual effect in the response scale. It
implies that evaluations of different vignettes
are correlated with each other and with the
self-reports (conditional on X i ), since some
respondents will tend to use high thresholds

and others will use low thresholds in all their
evaluations.
Define a benchmark respondent with characteristics Xi ⫽ X(B). The DIF adjustment involves comparing Y*ri to thresholds ␶ jB rather
than ␶ ji, where ␶ jB is obtained in the same way as
␶ ji but using X(B) instead of Xi. A respondent’s
work ability is computed using a benchmark
scale instead of a respondent’s own scale. This
does not give an adjusted score for each individual (since Y*ri is not observed), but it can be
used to simulate adjusted distributions of Yri for
the whole population or conditional upon some
of the characteristics in Xi.
Using self-reports on own work disabilities
only, parameters ␤ and ␥1 are not separately
identified,2 only their difference. For example,
consider country dummies: people in two different countries can have systematically different work disability, but if the scales on which
they report their work disability can also differ
across countries, then self-reports are not
enough to identify the work disability difference between the countries.
In the surveys we use, each respondent an-

using similar ordered response equations:

(6) ␧ li ⬃ N共0, ␴ 2 兲,
independent of each other, of ␧ri and of Xi .
Apart from dummies to indicate the vignettes,
the only explanatory variable in (4) is a dummy
for the gender of the vignette person. It is included because preliminary analysis suggested
that respondents react differently to vignettes
with a female name than with a male name.3 We
allow these differences to vary by domain, i.e.,
we include separate coefficients ␪d for d ⫽
affect (l ⫽ 1, ... , 5), pain (l ⫽ 6, ... , 10), or
CVD (l ⫽ 11, ... , 15). The assumption of
“response consistency” means that the thresholds ␶ji are the same for the self-reports and the
vignettes.
With these assumptions, it is clear how vignette evaluations can separately identify ␤ and
␥ (⫽␥1, ... , ␥5): from the vignette evaluations
alone, ␥, ␪, ␪1 , ... ␪5 can be identified (up to the
usual normalization of scale and location).
From the self-reports, ␤ can then be identified in
addition. Thus the vignettes can be used to solve
the identification problem due to DIF.
II. Data and Vignette Evaluations

A. Data Sources
We use information obtained from two Internet surveys, which we conducted in both
countries. For the Netherlands, we use the
CentERpanel, which includes about 2,250
households that agreed to respond to questions every weekend over the Internet. This
Dutch sample is not restricted to households
with their own Internet access. Respondents
are recruited by telephone. If they agree to

participate and do not have Internet access,
they are provided with Internet access (and, if
necessary, a set-top box). Thus, CentERpanel
is representative of the adult Dutch population, except the institutionalized.4 The sample
we use for estimation has 1,977 respondents
who participated in several interviews with
questions on work disability in 2003.
From multiple waves collected in the past,
CentERpanel has a rich set of variables on demographic and labor market characteristics of
the respondents, as well as several salient dimensions of health. In August 2003, we collected work disability self-reports and vignette
evaluations (described below). The Internet infrastructure makes CentERpanel an extremely
valuable tool to conduct experiments, with possibilities for randomization of content. Production lags are very short, with about one month
between module design and data delivery.
Based on our initial analysis, we fielded a second wave in October allowing us to randomize
the gender used in vignette questions. (In the
first wave, vignette persons always had the
same gender as the respondent.) A third wave
of experiments was administered in December
2003.
The RAND MS Internet panel was recruited
from respondents age 40 and older in the
Monthly Survey (MS) of Michigan’s Survey
Research Center. The MS, the leading consumer sentiments survey, produces the widely
used Index of Consumer Attitudes. MS respondents age 40 and older are asked if they have
Internet access and, if yes, if they are willing to
participate in Internet surveys. Those who agree
are added to our household panel to be interviewed regularly over the Internet. Our sample
consists of 672 respondents interviewed in the
first six months of 2004. Because of the smaller
size of the RAND MS Internet sample, we also
use 15,740 respondents younger than 75 in the
1998 Health and Retirement Study (HRS), the
most recent survey with a representative cohort

4
The Web site http://cdata4.uvt.nl/websitefiles/
representativiteit2005.pdf provides a comparison of sample
characteristics with the population distribution (in Dutch).
Generally the differences are minor, the most important
differences being in the domains of age and education: 13.8
percent of the population is over 65, versus 10.9 percent in
the sample; 62.7 percent of the population has at least a high
school diploma, versus 67.3 percent in the sample.

interviewed at ages 51 to 61. The HRS sample
has self-reports on work disability like the
RAND MS Internet panel and the CentERpanel,
but has no vignette questions.
The question on work disability in the US and
Dutch Internet surveys is: “Do you have any
impairment or health problem that limits the
kind or amount of paid work you can do?”
This question also appears in PSID and HRS.
US respondents answer on a two-point scale
(yes or no), while in the first wave of the Dutch
survey the possible answers are on the following five-point scale: (1) no, not at all, (2) yes, I
am mildly limited, (3) yes, I am moderately
limited, (4) yes, I am severely limited, (5) yes,
I am extremely limited, cannot work.
A few months later, Dutch respondents got
the same work disability question, but now with
the two-point scale (yes or no). The top panel of
Table 1 shows reported US disability rates by
age from the PSID and Dutch disability rates
obtained from CentERpanel using this twopoint scale. Especially for middle-age workers,
self-reported work disability is much higher
in the Netherlands than in the United States.
This difference is almost 20 percentage points

465

among the 45- to 54-year age group. In contrast,
the remaining rows in Table 1 suggest that the
Dutch population is healthier than the US population. With the sole exception of the somewhat subjective domain of emotional problems,
among those in the critical 45- to 64-year age
group, disease prevalence is always higher in
the United States.5 It is not central to our argument that the Dutch are healthier than the Americans; the main point is that differences in
standard measures of health are unlikely to explain the much higher Dutch self-reported work
disability rates.
B. Descriptive Statistics on Vignettes
We gave the Dutch and US Internet respondents five vignettes each in three domains of
work disability—pain, affect (or emotional
problems), and heart disease. These domains
were chosen because preliminary analysis indicated that they were the most important determinants of work disability and because they
span the range from a very subjective health
condition (affect) to a quite objective one (heart
disease), with pain being the intermediate case.
Our hypothesis was that variation in response
scales would increase with the subjectivity of
the health problem.
Two examples, the least and most severe
from the pain domain, are:6
1. [Katie] occasionally feels back pain at work,
but this has not happened for the last several
months now. If she feels back pain, it typically lasts only for a few days.
2. [Mark] has pain in his back and legs, and the
pain is present almost all the time. It gets
worse while he is working. Although medication helps, he feels uncomfortable when
moving around, holding and lifting things at
work.
All vignettes were presented with either a female or male name, randomized across respon-

5
All questions about health conditions, except that on
pain, are of the form, “Has the doctor ever told you that you
have ... .” The distribution of the number of doctor visits is
almost the same in both countries, suggesting that this does
not lead to a systematic difference.

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

dents. Within each domain, vignettes were
presented in random order to eliminate any
order effects. Comparing the rank ordering
of vignette evaluations across respondents
shows that different respondents tend to order
vignettes in the same way. We designed the
vignettes with an eye on cross-cultural comparability. Conceivably, one or two of the vignettes will still not be perfectly comparable,
but that would have only a minor effect on the
analysis, which will use 15 vignettes.
Table 2 compares Dutch and US vignette
evaluations. In each domain the ordering of
severity of the vignette description goes from
least severe (⫽1) to most severe (⫽5).7 Although health conditions of persons in the vignettes are the same in both countries, there are
some substantial differences in the evaluation
frequencies. In particular, for the first two (pain
and affect) vignettes describing people with relatively mild work limitations, US respondents
report much more often that these persons have
no limitation at all, where Dutch respondents
have a greater tendency to use the intermediate
categories “mildly” and “moderately.” As hypothesized, the differences between the two
countries in vignette evaluations are smallest in
the more “objective” domain of heart disease.
There is some indication that the Dutch are
reluctant to use the most extreme labeling of
work disability (extremely) and are more comfortable in the middle. US respondents often
evaluate a person as severely or extremely limited, where the Dutch still tend to answer “moderately.” These patterns imply that the Dutch seem
harder on vignette persons with a serious limitation and softer on those with a minor limitation.
This tendency for the Dutch to gravitate toward
the center is not limited to work disability. In a
7
In contrast to the CentERpanel, the RAND MS panel
has only respondents with prior Internet access. The critical
issue here is not whether the samples we use differ from the
population of interest in observable characteristics, since we
use sampling weights (and the HRS). The issue is whether
those in Internet samples, conditional on observables, use
different thresholds and thus give different vignette evaluations. For part of the Dutch sample, we know if respondents had Internet access before they joined the panel. We
reestimated the equations for the vignette evaluations with
additional dummies for whether a respondent had prior
Internet access or not. In all three domains, the coefficients
of these dummies turned out to be insignificant. This suggests that our results for the United States are not selective
due to prior Internet access.

MARCH 2007

five-point scale describing their general health status from excellent to poor, compared to the Dutch,
US respondents are four times more likely to state
that they are in excellent health, and twice as
likely to say they are in poor health.
For a dichotomous question on whether one
is work disabled or not, being softer on those
with a minor condition is much more important
than being harder on those with a serious work
limitation. Whether one labels someone as “severely” or “extremely” work limited does not
matter on a two-point scale, as people in both
categories will always be seen as having a work
disability. In contrast, the general reluctance of
the Dutch (relative to the Americans) to say that
someone is “not at all” work limited is critical.
Thus, Table 2 suggests that, especially in the
domains of pain and affect, the Dutch would be
harder on themselves if they used the US scales.
Using the US scales would reduce Dutch selfreported work disability prevalence, thereby
reducing the difference in work disability
prevalence between the two countries.
III. Empirical Estimates

A. Model Specifications
To estimate the model comparing work disability in the United States and the Netherlands, three
datasets are combined: the Dutch CentERpanel
(waves 1, 2, and 3, in August, October, and December 2003), the US RAND MS Internet panel,
and the US HRS wave 1998.8 CentERpanel and
RAND MS have exactly the same vignette questions on pain problems, emotional problems, and
cardiovascular disease. HRS has no vignettes.
CentERpanel has self-reports on work disability on a five-point scale and on a two-point
scale, while both US surveys have the two-point
scale only. To link the US (and Dutch) selfreports on the two-point scale to the US (and
Dutch) vignette evaluations on a five point
scale, we expand the model described above
with a transformation from the five-point scale
to the two-point scale. The Dutch data with both
scales for the same respondents show that the
cut-off point between “yes” and “no” for the

We use 1,978 observations from CentERpanel, 672
observations from the RAND MS Internet panel, and 15,740
observations on persons under the age of 75 from HRS
1998.

Implications
Within this basic structure, we consider several models to test the sensitivity of our main
results to different assumptions. The first
“benchmark model” uses all 15 vignettes covering three domains (affect, pain, and cardiovascular disease), assuming a common response
scale across these domains.10

model not allowing for any threshold variation
across respondents. The work disability equation in the latter model (first two columns) is
almost identical to a standard probit for the
probability of reporting a work disability, not
taking account of potential differences in reporting thresholds. The remaining columns concern
the model allowing for different response
scales. The middle two columns are the estimated effects of respondent characteristics on
the first response threshold ␥1, the most important threshold for determining whether someone
claims to be work disabled on a two-point scale
(see (3) and (7)). The final two columns are the
coefficients in the work disability equation after
correcting for differential response scales. A
likelihood ratio test strongly rejects the model
not allowing for response scale variation against
the more general model that does allow for DIF.

The same is found for each country separately,
in line with the many significant parameters in
the first threshold equation in Table 3.
We first focus on the impact of differential
response scales on within-country variation in
work disability. In the model without the DIF
correction, work disability in the United States
falls significantly with education level, rises
with age, is not significantly different for men
and women, and is significantly positively associated with all the health problems included in
the model. The age and particularly education
effects are steeper in the United States than in
the Netherlands. The DIF corrected results for
the United States imply an even larger fall in
work disability across education groups, since a
higher initial threshold for work disability is
used by those in the lowest education category
compared to the higher educated groups. In the

VOL. 97 NO. 1

KAPTEYN ET AL.: DISABILITY AND VIGNETTES IN THE US AND THE NETHERLANDS

Netherlands, there is no evidence of a relation
between response scales and education level,
and the relation between education level and
work disability is much weaker, both before and
after correcting for DIF.
In the United States, we estimate that women
use higher thresholds than men. In the Netherlands, there is no evidence that male and female
respondents use different thresholds. The effect
of gender on work disability is insignificant for
both countries. In general, there is substantially
less within-country variation in thresholds
among the more homogeneous Dutch. Since all
regressors are included as deviations from their
sample means, the significantly negative coefficient on the dummy for NL in ␥1 implies that
the respondent with average characteristics in
the Netherlands uses a significantly lower first
threshold than an otherwise identical respondent in the United States.
Pain and emotional problems are more important causes for work disability in the Netherlands. In both countries, respondents with
emotional problems use lower thresholds than
those without these problems, but the difference
is larger in the United States. Thus, the effect of
emotional problems on work disability is overestimated without correcting for DIF, particularly in the United States.
Finally, we discuss some parameter estimates
for the benchmark model not presented in Table 3. In addition to the use of different thresholds by gender, we find evidence that the
threshold used was lower if a female name was
used in the vignette description instead of a
male name: negative estimates of ␪d were found
for all three domains, and were significant for
pain and CVD. Thus, for a given vignette description, a male vignette person is seen as more
work disabled than a female vignette person, by
both male and female respondents.11
We find significant unobserved heterogeneity
in the thresholds, leading to a positive correlation between several vignette evaluations of the
same respondent, and between self-reports and
vignette evaluations. The estimated standard deviation of the unobserved heterogeneity term ui
in (3) is 3.62 with standard error 0.15. With the
standard deviation of unobserved heterogeneity

in respondent work disability set to 10 and the
estimated standard deviation of the error term in
the vignette equation of 5.51, this implies a
correlation coefficient of 0.08 between selfreports and vignette evaluations, with observed
characteristics Xi held constant.
C. Comparisons of Work Disability across
Countries
In this section, we present the results of simulations based on our models for the basic
question of how important response scale differences are in explaining differences between
the United States and the Netherlands in reported rates of work disability. We focus on the
51– 64 age group and use sample weights at the
respondent level that are provided with the HRS
and CentERpanel to make the samples population representative of the 51– 64 age groups in
the two countries. The simulations take the explanatory variables in the two samples as given
and simulate values of work disability and of the
thresholds, using US thresholds for both the US
and the Dutch sample.
We first consider the model without DIF and
the benchmark model (see Table 4). The model
without DIF predicts work disability rates of
22.7 percent in the United States and 35.8 percent in the Netherlands, a difference of more
than 57 percent. This is similar to what is in the
raw data and to what the benchmark model
predicts if the Dutch use the Dutch scales and
the US respondents use the US scales (numbers
not shown). If the Dutch would use the US
response scales, however, the simulations show
that reported work disability would be reduced
to 28.3 percent, only 23.4 percent more than the
US rate. Thus, for this age group, the difference
in response scales explains more than half of the
difference in the raw data.
Table 4 also uncovers to what extent, according to the same benchmark model, chronic
health conditions explain the work disability
rate in both countries, again using the US
thresholds for the Dutch as well as the US
respondents. Consider an evaluation of the impact of a health condition j. Let P( A) and P(B)
be the (predicted) work disability rates in countries A and B, and let P( A)⫺j and P(B)⫺j be the
predicted work disabilities in countries A and B
for the “counterfactual” situation that nobody
would suffer from health problem j. P( A) ⫺

the corresponding coefficient in ␤). We can write

where g(xi , bA) is the probability that an individual with characteristics xi and parameter vector bA has a work limitation; and x⫺j
is the
i
vector xi with its j-th element xij equal to zero.
The first factor in the right-hand side of (8) is
the fraction in country A that suffers from the
chosen health problem (the “prevalence effect”
for country A). In the second term, ⌬g(xi , bA) is
the marginal effect for a dummy variable, the

difference if it is set to 1 or 0, with other variables
set to their values for observation i. Thus the
second term can be seen as the average impact of
the health problem on the probability of work
disability for those who have the health problem.
Table 4 shows that prevalence of all chronic
health conditions for the 51– 64 age group is
larger in the United States than in the Netherlands, with the exception of pain. Pain has by
far the largest impact on work disability of all
chronic conditions in both countries. Moreover,
the impact of pain is much larger in the Netherlands than in the United States. In the model
with DIF, it explains a work disability rate of
13.9 percentage points in the Netherlands and
7.9 percentage points in the United States. All
health conditions in the model can jointly explain 20.6 percentage points of the total work
disability in the Netherlands and 16.1 percentage
points in the United States. All health conditions
combined thus explain 4.5 percent of the total
5.5-percentage point differential in work disability
between the two countries. Pain by itself could,
however, already explain the total difference.

according to the benchmark model, most of the
difference in reported work disability between
the two countries is due to response scale differences. The third line presents the results for a
model similar to the benchmark model, but ignoring individual unobserved heterogeneity in
the scales (ui in equation (3)). The outcomes
hardly change. The fourth line of Table 5 presents results for the benchmark model in which
the three categories—moderate, severe, and extreme work disability—are combined for the
five-point scale self-reports and the vignette
evaluations. We see hardly any difference with
the benchmark model. This is what we expected, since the yes or no scale is driven by the
distinction between none, mild, and moderate,
while the thresholds between the more severe
categories play no role. Another issue for our
sensitivity analysis is the use of health conditions as regressors. Until now, we have ignored
potential measurement and cross-country comparability issues with these reported health conditions, which may play a role (Michael Baker
et al. 2004). If there are systematic differences
in reporting health conditions across countries,
this might bias our results. We therefore reestimated the benchmark model excluding the
health conditions from the equations for work
disability and the thresholds. The results in the
fifth row of Table 5 show that this makes little
difference for the predicted work disability rate.
The estimated difference between the Netherlands and the United States using US response
scales in both countries becomes 17.8 percent,
even somewhat lower than the 23.4 percent in
the benchmark model.

The benchmark model assumes that response
scale differences are the same in all domains of
work-related disability. That is, if US respondents are harder on people with pain problems
than Dutch respondents, then they are also
harder on people with emotional problems or
people with heart problems. To check whether
this assumption is reasonable, we have reestimated the benchmark model using the vignettes
in only one of the three domains. The resulting
predictions are presented in the next three rows
of Table 5. They show that vignettes in the three
domains lead to different conclusions. If we use
the affect vignettes only, the correction for response scale differences is very large, and response scale differences explain almost the
complete difference in the self-reported rate of
work disability. But if we use only the vignettes
on heart problems, the opposite conclusion is
obtained: respondents in the United States and
the Netherlands use similar response scales, and
less than a quarter of the difference in selfreported work disability rates is explained by response scale differences. For the pain vignettes,
the results are in between these two extremes and
similar to those for the benchmark model. Thus,
these results cast doubt on the assumption of common response scales across health domains.
The final row presents results from a more
general model, which accounts for different response scales for the three domains. This model
is explained in detail in online Appendix 3
(available at http://www.e-aer.org/data/mar07/
20041059_app.pdf). Although the assumptions underlying this model are very different
from those of the benchmark model, the result-

472

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

ing estimate of the percentage difference in
work disability between the United States and
the Netherlands is almost identical to the estimate for the benchmark model.
IV. Conclusions

In sharp contrast to the believed similarity in
their health outcomes, workers in different
Western countries report very different rates of
work disability. This contradiction continues to
be seen as a major unresolved puzzle. In this
paper, using new data from the United States
and the Netherlands, we offer a partial resolution of the puzzle. We find that a large part of
observed differences in reported work disability
stems from the fact that residents of the two
countries use different response scales in answering standard questions on whether they
have a work disability. Essentially, for the same
level of actual work disability, Dutch respondents have a lower response threshold in claiming disability than American respondents do.
We reached this conclusion by implementing
a vignette methodology for Internet surveys in
both countries. Our vignettes gave respondents
the same simple scenarios in which hypothetical
workers varied in the objective circumstances of
their work disability. Respondents were asked
to rate the extent of that disability. Especially in
the more subjective health domains of pain and
emotion, the evidence is strong that American
respondents use a “tougher” standard when assigning a work disability status. While explaining these different standards is an important
research question in itself, there seems little
question they exist. While one may quarrel with
the specific assumptions in each modeling approach in the paper, the similarity of their
implications for explaining international differences in work disability is striking.
In addition to their role in explaining crosscountry differences, vignettes are a useful tool
in helping us understand within-country differences in reporting. Using vignettes given to
Americans shows that different thresholds are
used by three of the most widely used empirical
determinants of work disability—sex, education, and age. Such differences also have implications for the use of self-reported health as an
explanatory variable in models explaining, e.g.,
labor force participation or mortality. While
self-reported health is typically strongly corre-

MARCH 2007

lated with objective health indicators (see Ellen
Idler and Yael Benyamini 1997), its measurement scale may well vary systematically with
other explanatory variables, biasing the estimated coefficients of these other variables. For
example, Hendrik Juerges (forthcoming) finds
that next to self-reported health, socioeconomic
variables have an independent predictive effect
on mortality. Without further information, one
cannot determine whether the effect of the socioeconomic variables is real or whether it simply picks up systematic differences in the selfreported health measures. Vignettes provide an
opportunity to directly analyze scale differences
and correct for them.
Vignettes represent a potentially important
new methodological tool that may aid in the
analyses of other applications besides health
and disability. Any time threshold scales categorize individual responses, the question will arise
as to whether people really differ or whether
they are simply not using the same scales. Vignettes can help answer that question in such
varied applications as general well-being scales,
political efficacy (King et al. 2004), health problems, consumer satisfaction, risk measurement,
and perception of poverty. The application of a
new technique like vignettes also poses new
methodological questions. Internet surveys appear
to be a powerful tool to address such questions.
