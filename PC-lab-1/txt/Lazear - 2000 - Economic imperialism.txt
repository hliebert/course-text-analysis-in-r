ECONOMIC IMPERIALISM*
EDWARD P. LAZEAR
Economics is not only a social science, it is a genuine science. Like the physical
sciences, economics uses a methodology that produces refutable implications and
tests these implications using solid statistical techniques. In particular, economics
stresses three factors that distinguish it from other social sciences. Economists use
the construct of rational individuals who engage in maximizing behavior. Economic models adhere strictly to the importance of equilibrium as part of any
theory. Finally, a focus on efficiency leads economists to ask questions that other
social sciences ignore. These ingredients have allowed economics to invade
intellectual territory that was previously deemed to be outside the discipline’s
realm.

By almost any market test, economics is the premier social
science. The field attracts the most students, enjoys the attention
of policy-makers and journalists, and gains notice, both positive
and negative, from other scientists. In large part, the success of
economics derives from its rigor and relevance as well as from its
generality. The economic toolbox can be used to address a large
variety of problems drawn from a wide range of topics.
In earliest times, economics was not distinct from other social
sciences or even philosophy. Aristotle and Plato discussed economic issues in the context of social philosophy. Adam Smith
[1776], Ricardo, and Malthus analyzed economic factors in broader
contexts than most economists do today. The American Economic
Association itself was hewn from the societies of other fields. The
AEA was created as a joint effort of the American Social Science
Association and the American Historical Association for the
purpose of encouraging economic research.1
At least during the last four decades, economics has expanded
its scope of inquiry as well as its sphere of influence. Neither luck
nor the inherent charm of economists is responsible for the
change. Rather, the ascension of economics results from the fact
that our discipline has a rigorous language that allows complicated concepts to be written in relatively simple, abstract terms.
The language permits economists to strip away complexity. Com* This research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation. I

plexity may add to the richness of description, but it also prevents
the analyst from seeing what is essential.2
Our rigorous language can be used in many ways, but over
the years, three themes have become fundamental in economics.
First, economists assume that individuals engage in maximizing
rational behavior. Second, economics adheres strictly to the
importance of equilibrium as part of any theory. Third, economists
place a heavy emphasis on a clearly defined concept of efficiency.
The starting point in economic theory is that the individual or
the firm is maximizing something, usually utility or profit.
Economists, almost without exception, make constrained maximization the basic building block of any theory. Many of our
empirical analyses seek to test models that are based on maximizing behavior. When we obtain results that seem to deviate from
what would appear to be individually rational, we reexamine the
evidence or revise the theory. But the theoretical revisions almost
never drop the assumption that individuals are maximizing
something, even if the something is unorthodox. Few economists
are willing to concede that individuals simply do not know what
they are doing. We may permit imperfect information, transaction
costs, and other intervening variables to muddy the waters, but
we do not model behavior as being determined by forces beyond
the control of the individual. Most sociologists, by contrast, argue
that understanding the constraints is more important than
understanding the behavior that results from optimization, given
the constraints.3
The emphasis on maximization is important because it allows
an analyst to make predictions in new situations. When individuals are assumed to maximize something, a well-defined and
predictable behavioral response to any stimulus can be derived.
Other social sciences that are unwilling to assume maximization
are in the position of being unable to predict in new situations.
The maximum of a function is a well-understood concept; other
rules are not, especially when they vary from situation to situation.
2. Rigor need not take the form of mathematics, but much of economic rigor
relies on its mathematical precision. Although many economists of earlier years
were accomplished mathematicians, Samuelson [1947] made mathematical economics available to the profession at large.
3. Becker and Murphy [2000] argue that when social feedback effects are
sufficiently strong, the maximizing individual will not be sensitive to the traditional variables of price and income. As a result, it will appear as though individual
behavior is dictated by society. They argue that a more fruitful way to think about
this is to allow for individual maximization with strong social interaction effects.
In this way, equilibria can be understood, and the nature of the result and
feedbacks can be studied and predicted.

A corollary of maximization is that on the margin, there are
always trade-offs. The notion that there is no free lunch is central
to economics. The simple, but crucial concept of opportunity cost
lies behind much of the ability of economics to extend into other
areas. Sometimes the trade-offs are subtle. Prices and costs are
not necessarily parameters that are observed in market data, but
they affect behavior nonetheless. Other social sciences do not
place the same weight on explicit recognition of the tension
between costs and benefits, which reduces the ability of these
fields to grapple systematically with social phenomena. Thinking
about trade-offs gives rise to related thoughts on substitutability.
Economists place emphasis on choice. Things are not technologically determined. This is true for consumers and producers alike.
There is no fixed number of jobs. Firms can trade off between
employing labor and capital, and workers can choose between
labor and leisure.
Second, as in the physical sciences, equilibrium is a central
concept in economics. Virtually all economic theories have as
primary desiderata that the behavior described must be consistent with some notion of equilibrium. Economic theory usually
consists of modeling the behavior of agents. Then, behavior of the
individual actors is aggregated to examine what happens when
they interact. Often, this is in the context of a market. The
economist’s most familiar tools are supply and demand, which
appeared during the nineteenth century (see Jenkin [1931, originally 1871]). Marshall [1890] made heavy use of these tools and
derived a rich set of implications and testable predictions. Although the behavior of individuals who lie behind the supply and
demand curves is inherently interesting, it is the interest in
equilibrium itself that distinguishes economics from other social
sciences. To be sure, other social sciences discuss spillover and
feedback effects, but among social scientists, only economists
insist on a physical-sciences-style equilibrium as part of the
analysis.
Third, much of economics is driven by the notion that
efficiency is important. Adam Smith’s [1776] concept of the
invisible hand is a guiding principle in economics. Individuals
acting in their self-interest further the general goals of society.
Smith took the moral ideas of the Enlightenment (especially the
emphasis on free will) and transformed them into a positive
theory of the economy, with limited or no role for the state. More
formal statements have been provided during this century. The

idea that competitive equilibrium is efficient appears in the
literature since the time of Marshall.4
The importance of efficiency is not that it is an apology for the
status quo. Efficiency is a concept that, together with equilibrium,
pushes economists to do a particular kind of analysis. When
economists model a situation and the resulting equilibrium is
inefficient, usually there are trades that could have occurred that
are implicitly or explicitly ruled out. The analyst or his critics are
induced to ask what the reasons are and what market or other
institutions could arise to remedy the situation. Thus, the focus on
efficiency when combined with equilibrium prevents the economist from being content with partial answers and half-truths. The
notion that efficiency is a natural outcome motivates a larger
series of questions and initiates deeper analysis. It also permits
economists to make clear, unambiguous policy statements, although the assumptions that lie behind welfare economics are
somewhat controversial. Still, Pareto optimality is a well-defined
concept that allows us to take an axiomatic approach to issues
over which other fields can only wring their hands.
Other social scientists generally ignore equilibrium considerations.5 In part, this is intentional, reflecting a belief that
equilibrium takes too long to reach and too many things change
before a given equilibrium is ever attained. For the most part,
however, it is simply taken as a given, much as equilibrium is
taken as a given for economists. In sociology and psychology,
equilibrium is rarely considered. For economists, it is a necessary
component of the model.
The power of economics lies in its rigor. Economics is scientific; it follows the scientific method of stating a formal refutable
theory, testing the theory, and revising the theory based on the
evidence. Economics succeeds where other social sciences fail
because economists are willing to abstract. The old joke about a
stranded, starving economist assuming a can opener to open a can
of food pokes fun at our willingness to assume away what we
4. Early examples include Hotelling [1938] and Bergson [1938]. Formal
analyses are found in Arrow [1951a] and Debreu [1951].
5. On rare occasion, sociologists develop models that discuss an equilibrium.
One such example is Berger and Snell [1957]. Interestingly, this paper was heavily
influenced by economics, in particular, the work of Prais [1955a, 1955b].
An important more recent exception is sociobiology, e.g., Wilson [1975]. This
field uses the same approaches as those of economists to explain evolutionary
developments. A nice summary of the literature on social selection of mates is
found in Ridley [1993]. This book makes constant reference to trade-offs and to
efficiency of equilibria and reads like an economics article.

believe to be unimportant or difficult details. Economists are used
to posing the counterfactual question to do analysis. What would
one expect in the absence of the hypothesized effect? What would
be observed? Do the data allow us to choose between various
hypotheses? Economists are not alone among social scientists in
following this method, but this form of inquiry has become the
standard for economic research.
It is the ability to abstract that allows us to answer questions
about a complicated world. As economists, however, we believe in
comparative advantage. I have argued elsewhere that the strength
of economic theory is that it is rigorous and analytic (see Lazear
[1995], Chapter 1). But the weakness of economics is that to be
rigorous, simplifying assumptions must be made that constrain
the analysis and narrow the focus of the researcher. It is for this
reason that the broader-thinking sociologists, anthropologists,
and perhaps psychologists may be better at identifying issues, but
worse at providing answers. Our narrowness allows us to provide
concrete solutions, but sometimes prevents us from thinking
about the larger features of the problem. This specialization is not
a flaw; much can be learned from other social scientists who
observe phenomena that we often overlook. But the parsimony of
our method and ability to provide specific, well-reasoned answers
gives us a major advantage in analysis.
There are two claims made in this essay. The first is that
economics has been imperialistic, and the second is that economic
imperialism has been successful.6 To establish the validity of the
argument, it is first necessary to define economic imperialism and
then to establish a criterion against which success can be judged.
Economic imperialism is defined as the extension of economics to
topics that go beyond the classical scope of issues, which include
consumer choice, theory of the firm, (explicit) markets, macroeconomic activity, and the fields spawned directly by these areas. The
most aggressive economic imperialists aim to explain all social
behavior by using the tools of economics. Areas traditionally
deemed to be outside the realm of economics because they do not
use explicit markets or prices are analyzed by the economic
imperialist. For example, discrimination against particular groups,
6. This is not the first time this claim has been made. See, for example,
Raditzky and Berholz [1987].

traditionally thought of as a perhaps irrational social phenomenon, has been addressed by economists during the past 40
years.7
Additionally, those issues that lie at a deeper level than those
of traditional economics are also part of economic imperialism.
Economics is extended to consider questions that are inside the
‘‘black box.’’ For example, microeconomics historically took the
firm as an entity. Modern economics examines the structure of
relations within the firm, including issues of personnel policy and
market strategy that have traditionally been outside the scope of
economic analysis. Historically, economists assumed that firms
would simply do what was best for maximizing profits, without
attempting to describe the details on how profit maximization is
best achieved.
Economists generally believe in the market test. Economic
imperialism can be judged to be successful only if it passes this
test, which means that the analyses of the imperialists must
influence others. The effort to extend the field measures its
success by inducing others to adopt the economic approach to
explore issues that are not part of classical economics.8 One
possibility is that scholars outside of economics use economic
analyses to understand social issues. Political scientists, lawyers,
and sociologists come to use the methods of economics to answer
the questions that are of interest in their fields. Another possibility is that economists expand the boundaries of economics and
simply replace outsiders as analysts of ‘‘noneconomic’’ issues,
forcing noneconomists out of business, as it were, or at least
providing them with competition on an issue in which they
formerly possessed a monopoly. Below, it will be argued that both
routes have been followed with success.
In what follows, a number of new areas into which economics
has broken will be discussed. In each case, I will attempt to
illustrate by way of these examples, how the framework, the focus
on maximizing behavior, equilibrium, and efficiency have led to
new insights on a diverse array of subjects.

7. Modern economic imperialism’s birth is due primarily to Gary Becker, but
there are precedents in the work on household economics by Margaret Reid [1934]
and on human capital by T. W. Schultz [1959, 1961, 1963].
8. It is always a bit dangerous to claim that an area was not part of classical
economics. There are very few topics today that cannot be argued to have some
roots in the writings of the classical economists, especially Adam Smith.

ECONOMIC IMPERIALISM

LOOKING

INSIDE THE

105

ATOM

Much of economic imperialism is analogous to looking inside
the atom. For many purposes in physics and especially chemistry,
taking the atom as the relevant unit of analysis is appropriate.
For example, chemists tell us that water is made from the
combination of two hydrogen atoms with one oxygen atom. But for
other purposes, such as the production and harnessing of nuclear
power, it is necessary to understand that the atom is made up of
electrons, neutrons, and protons and to understand how they
interact with one another.
The same is true in economics. For many questions, it is
sufficient to think in terms of an individual, a household, or a firm.
But the economic imperialists have not been content with answering questions that can be dealt with at that level of abstraction.
They have tried to understand the preferences of the individual,
the composition of the household, and the internal workings of the
firm to answer more questions that are of interest to social
scientists.
Let us begin, then, by examining economic imperialism that
takes the form of moving to a deeper level of analysis. We start by
considering consumer theory and with it, the preferences of and
budget constraint faced by the individual.
CONSUMER THEORY
Modeling Tastes
In modern decades Gary Becker is surely the economist who
has done the most to expand the boundaries of economics into the
other social sciences, particularly sociology.9 Sociology arose in the
early part of this century as a reaction against individual rationalism. Over his career Becker has reasserted the ability of economics, with its assumption of rational, maximizing behavior, to
explain social phenomena that were in the purview of sociology. In
virtually every area of economic imperialism, Becker’s work plays
a prominent and often controversial role. Like it or not, Becker
has forced sociologists to take account of his theories.

9. For an excellent discussion of the impact of economics on sociology, see
Baron and Hannan [1994], who argue that most of the attention that sociologists
have paid to economics is directed toward human capital and critiques thereof.

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

One of Becker’s early important contributions was more of a
foray into psychology than it was an attempt to move to the level
of society. Rather than trying to describe tastes directly, Becker
recast consumption as production so that changes in prices and
income could be the driving forces to understanding behavior.
Becker’s ‘‘Theory of the Allocation of Time’’ [1965] gave economists
a different way of thinking about consumption and labor supply.
This work, and that of Lancaster, gave major impetus to the
creation of a field that has come to be known as household
economics. Both Becker and Lancaster viewed goods as inputs
into an individual’s or household’s production function. What
entered the utility function were commodities zi that could be
produced by some combination of goods xi and time ti, according to
a production function,
zi ⫽ f (xi,ti ).
This seemingly minor change in specification gave rise to a
large number of implications and was especially helpful in
explaining behavior. Rather than focusing on taste differences,
Becker placed the emphasis on subtle prices and replaced some of
the emphasis on heterogeneous preferences with a measurable
and testable source of variation. Time-intensive commodities are
more expensive to high-wage individuals than are goods-intensive
commodities. Thus, high-wage people enjoy their leisure in different ways than low-wage people. High-wage people may spend
fewer hours in leisure activities, but these involve high priced
goods such as opera tickets, expensive restaurant meals, and
yachting. Low-wage people combine their time with relatively low
cost inputs spending a higher fraction of their time playing
basketball and watching television.
Instead of assuming that poor people have different tastes
than rich people, the allocation of time framework allowed
economists to think about differences in consumption patterns in
a systematic way. Poor people consume more time-intensive
commodities not because they like them better than rich people,
but because they cost relatively less to poor people who place a
lower value on their time. Since economists are not particularly
good at modeling taste differences across individuals, this model
provided a real insight into at least some differences in consumption patterns. It also brought economics into the realm of psychology. The theory made it possible to predict the preferences of
individuals for particular goods. Although economists generally

ECONOMIC IMPERIALISM

107

concede the analysis of tastes to psychologists, the allocation of
time approach provided some competition. Most important, the
predictions of the allocation of time model are borne out in market
data and could also be tested using laboratory experiments.
Demography
Malthus [1890] was the first economist to model population
growth. Noticing that income and population growth were positively correlated both cross-sectionally and over time, Malthus set
about to construct an economic theory of population dynamics.
Most important, Malthus’ view of population relied on quite a
formal notion of equilibrium, which was determined by the
subsistence level of consumption. Furthermore, Malthus did allow
(in his second version) for choice to play a role in the determination of the fertility rate. Malthus discussed delayed marriage,
abstinence, and other methods that could be used to reduce
population growth that result from the choice of individuals over
childbearing. Malthus’ model was quite successful at explaining
the facts that prevailed during his time, but the theory did not do
so well in explaining the population patterns of the twentieth
century.
To explain twentieth century patterns, Becker used a direct
extension of the allocation of time framework, which allowed for
an even greater role of choice than did Malthus’ framework. In one
of Becker’s more controversial works, he modeled the choice to
have children as the demand for a consumer durable (see Becker
[1960b]). Children produce a stream of services over time, much
like an automobile, so one could talk about population growth in
terms of consumption and demand curves.
The allocation of time approach is useful in predicting more
recent time series and cross-sectional difference in fertility behavior. High-wage women are less likely to have children than
low-wage women. Since child services (the commodity produced
with children) is a time-intensive commodity, high-wage women
face a higher price of children than do low-wage women. Also, as
labor force opportunities improve for women, in part because of
more equal distribution of education, women find it more costly to
have children. The policy implications of this theory are profound:
to reduce fertility, it is important to raise the wage rate of women
and improve their labor market alternatives.
Becker argued that most of what determined fertility rates
was choice and further, that individuals make rational decisions

to have children. Data supported his view. Declines in childhood
mortality rates were followed by declines in fertility rates, suggesting that people were adjusting their behavior to obtain a desired
family size.
There is considerable evidence of the success of the economic
approach to fertility. Economists play an important role at annual
demography meetings, publish papers on demography in both
economic and demography journals, and are significant in the
policy discussion. Even demographers who do not embrace the
economic approach,10 view it as a force to be reckoned with.
Discrimination
An early economic exploration of the issue of discrimination
was Gunnar Myrdal’s An American Dilemma [1944]. Myrdal’s
work made tastes for discrimination endogenous and discussed a
self-reinforcing equilibrium. He argued (see Chapter 9) that three
factors, namely, economic well-being, ex post intelligence and
educational attainment, and discrimination by whites were linked.
Any one would give rise to the other two. This created a vicious
circle and perpetuated the state of poverty into which the AfricanAmerican found himself locked.
A more rigorous approach was provided by Becker in his
doctoral dissertation. In fact, Becker started his imperialistic
crusade in this work, which examined the phenomenon of discrimination, especially racial discrimination [Becker 1957]. Becker
modeled discrimination as a taste against a particular group, but
a taste that varied throughout the population. Becker assumed
that a taste for discrimination was part of an individual’s utility
function. As a result, discrimination could be analyzed in the same
way that the demand for other goods could be understood. The
taste might reflect a utility function that most would regard as
objectionable, sinister, or evil, but the behavior of the individual
possessing such a taste is rational, that is, consistent with
maximizing behavior. In the context of discrimination, being
rational means being willing to pay a price in order to exercise
one’s taste for discrimination. In the labor market context, this
would imply that an employer who did not like blacks would be
willing to pay a higher wage to white workers of equal ability.
Specifically, one could define a discrimination coefficient from the

10. A case in point was Kingsley Davis, the late, well-known demographer.

109

following relation:
ww ⬅ wb ⫹ d
or
d ⬅ ww ⫺ wb,
where ww is the wage of white workers and wb is the wage of black
workers. An individual possessing a discrimination coefficient d
would be indifferent between hiring a black at wage wb and a
white at wage ww. The larger the value of d, the greater is an
individual’s discrimination against a particular group. Given this
value of d, the individual’s behavior was hypothesized to be
otherwise completely consistent with standard predictions of
consumer behavior.
Not only did Becker make rationality part of the theory, but
discussion of market equilibrium was an essential part of the
analysis. Because tastes vary, some employers are willing to pay a
larger discrimination premium than others. But it is the taste of
the marginal agent, not the average agent, that determines prices
in markets. This means that the wage differential between black
and white workers depended on supply as well as demand. If there
are very few individuals from the group against which there was
discrimination, then the equilibrium wage differential will not be
large. Individuals from each group simply work for employers
with the least taste against them. This gives the implication that
wage differentials are smaller in markets with fewer of the
discriminated against individuals.
Efficiency considerations also pushed Becker to consider the
dynamics of this market. Since individuals who discriminate pay
higher wages than those who do not, discriminators must accept a
lower return on their capital. The expectation is that in the long
run, discriminatory employers are replaced by nondiscriminatory
ones. Thus, discrimination should not persist over the long run.
The fact that wage differentials have persisted for a long period of
time suggests that other explanations, perhaps relating to discrimination that occurs before the individual enters the labor market or
discrimination at the level of the consumer, need be found.
Becker’s model also provides a way to test for the existence of
discrimination. For example, if it is alleged that lenders discriminate against a particular group, then those who do not discriminate should earn higher returns on their loans than those who do.

Economic theory provides a clear prediction that can be tested
using cross-sectional data.
Becker’s analysis of discrimination is one of the best examples of the ability of economics to understand ‘‘noneconomic’’
issues. Discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or religion is
viewed by most as heinous, and the topic often inspires heated
discussion. Nevertheless, the emotional aspect of the topic did not
prevent economists from thinking about discrimination in a
rigorous way. Economics derives the logical conclusions of a set of
assumptions about discriminatory tastes and provides clean and
testable implications. By adding a degree of logic to the discussion, economics has made a topic that previously could only be
discussed in emotional terms one that is the subject of a great deal
of theoretical and empirical analysis.
The Family
Most analyses in consumer theory assume that the utility
function reflects the preferences of an individual or sometimes of a
household. The composition of the household is taken as given.
The economics of the family tries to understand the determinants
of household structure and the interactions of its members, rather
than taking the unit as a given. The major work in this area again
belongs to Becker. Becker’s [1991b] Treatise on the Family, first
published about twenty years ago, dramatically changed the way
that academicians thought about the family. Almost heretical,
Becker’s willingness to extend the economic framework to consider topics like marriage and divorce, love for children and
parents, institutions such as primogeniture and even discipline,
reward, and punishment in the context of the family, was nothing
short of revolutionary.
As is always the case in Becker’s work, rational maximizing
behavior is the key to understanding behavior even when it comes
to such seemingly irrational activities as love. Becker’s theory of
marriage and divorce relates closely to labor market theories of
specific human capital and to matching theory (see Jovanovic
[1979]). In the labor market, ‘‘marriages’’ between workers and
firms tend to survive when the match is a good one. A good match
consists of a situation where there is more surplus generated by
the particular pairing than by other configurations. When workers have firm-specific human capital, the worker’s value to his
current employer exceeds that to another. Such pairings are
robust. Analogously, marriages that have a great deal of marriage-

specific capital are also likely to survive. Two proxies for marriagespecific human capital are the existence of children and the
number of years during which the couple has been together.
Children are marriage-specific because, perhaps for evolutionary
reasons, parents tend to love their own children more than adults
love the children of others. The presence of children, Becker
suggests, reduces the likelihood of a breakup. Also, just as
firm-specific human capital increases with time on the job,
marriage-specific capital increases with time in the marriage.
Thus, the observed patterns of declining hazard rates with job
tenure are mirrored in the relation of divorce to time of marriage.
The pattern shown in Figure I is consistent with the data on both
worker turnover and divorce.11
The way that parents relate to their children is modeled by
appealing to altruism, which means formally that the child’s
utility (or consumption) enters the parent’s utility function. The
distribution of schooling across families and between siblings
within families can be explained as an attempt to equalize utility
across offspring. Such institutions as primogeniture, coupled with

sending a second son to the military, college, or the clergy can be
understood in this context. Analogously, the patterns of support of
the elderly and their housing choices also fit into this framework.
Related to this work are some important spillovers into
macroeconomic and social security policy. Barro’s [1974] work on
Ricardian equivalence and the effect of various governmental
policies on investment derive in large part from thinking in terms
of intergenerational links and altruism. Auerbach and Kotlikoff
[1987] build a system of intergenerational accounting that uses
the economics of the family as a foundation.
Becker’s work on the family is recognized, both inside economics and to some extent in other fields as well, as the most
comprehensive and rigorous treatment of family formation and
preferences to date. Again, the market test vindicates the use of
economics to understand family behavior. Ideas that were considered bizarre and almost comical twenty years ago are now
standard. Even sociologists, who were initially very resistant to
the concepts, have given some ground here.12
Social Interactions
Taste formation has generally been declared off limits to
economists. Preferences are of primary interest to psychologists
and to sociologists. More recent studies in economics have attempted to incorporate the concepts of the other social sciences,
but in doing so, to provide theories that better explain the social
phenomena from which the observations are derived. In particular, concepts that have long been discussed in other fields now are
analyzed by economists as well. For example, the sociologist’s
notions of peer pressure, norms, and social interaction now appear
in the economics literature.
Sociologists stress the importance of constraints imposed on
individuals by the fact that they live in a community, interacting
with other individuals. Peer pressure is exactly one such interaction. Kandel and Lazear [1992] consider the effect of peer pressure
on work effort. Individuals maximize, but take into account the

James Coleman, is a move back in the direction of economics. Furthermore, in
addition to being a member of its Department of Economics, Becker is a member of
the Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago.

equilibrium outcome of a process where deviations from any given
(say, mean) level of effort results in direct or indirect sanctions.
Peer pressure is more likely to be effective in small groups.
A more complete theory of social interaction is offered by
Becker and Murphy [2000]. The emphasis here is on maximizing
behavior, but an additional important component is attention paid
to equilibrium. The word ‘‘market’’ in the title of their work, Social
Markets: The Marriage of ‘‘Economic’’ and ‘‘Social’’ Forces,13
emphasizes that the action takes place in an equilibrium framework. Specifically, Becker and Murphy allow for feedback effects
from other individuals. As in Kandel and Lazear, Becker and
Murphy postulate a utility function where concern for the actions
of others is important. Thus, an individual may prefer to go to a
restaurant that others favor simply because he derives utility
from being associated with these individuals or the image of going
to a crowded restaurant.14 Becker [1991a] shows that such
behavior can result in multiple equilibria and may cause a
restaurant with long queues of customers to resist raising prices.
By raising prices, and reducing the number of individuals who
come to the restaurant, additional spillover effects are created
that reduce the demand for the restaurant’s product. Under such
circumstances, it may be more profitable to charge a lower price
and to encourage large queues. Earlier, Schelling [1978] used the
same kind of analysis to explain how a neighborhood could tip
from being predominantly white to predominantly nonwhite.
Rather than saying that individuals have little control over
outcomes because most are determined by social constraints,
Becker and Murphy prefer to frame the problem in terms of
maximization in the face of large spillover effects. When these
effects are large, the elasticities of quantities with respect to the
traditional variables of price and income are small. They argue
that this is what sociologists mean when they say that individuals
are constrained by the actions of society because agents are less
responsive to the standard economic variables.
The more general point illustrated by this example is that
feedback effects can affect individual decision-making, which in
turn affects the equilibrium that is observed. The importance of
13. Schelling [1978] considered social markets using a somewhat different
approach, but also assuming rationality and maximization.
14. Another way to think about this is that there is information conveyed by
the fact that others are purchasing a particular good or service. This has been
emphasized in the finance literature, e.g., Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch
[1992], and Bulow and Klemperer [1994].

thinking about the world in this way is first that it changes the
focus from the nonrational to the systematic and predictable.
Second, it causes the researcher to ask other questions that do not
arise in a nonmaximizing context. Becker and Murphy emphasize
the importance of reference groups when large social spillovers
exist. If individuals’ elasticities are small once peer effects are
considered, then it is important to choose one’s friends wisely.
Thus, the choice of neighborhood in which to locate is a decision
that affects many aspects of consumption. This theory provides a
different way to think about neighborhood effects and location
choice. Finally, the theory is extended to examine dynamic
structures and especially fads and fashion, where feedback effects
seem to be the heart of the issue. The notion that social spillovers
are important has been used to examine criminal behavior and to
predict riots. In this invasion into the study of crime, the notion of
equilibrium is again key. Sah [1991] models the spillover effects of
crime on the probability of a given criminal being apprehended. In
neighborhoods where many crimes are being committed, the
probability that any one criminal will be caught is low because
police are busy chasing others.15 DiPasquale and Glaeser [1998]
have extended the idea to model the likelihood of riots. This is
modeled as a situation of multiple equilibria, where spillover
effects determine whether a riot occurs or not. If a potential rioter
believes that no others will riot, he is reluctant to take action for
fear that he will be caught. But if many others are rioting, the
limited police resources are spread thin, reducing the probability
of detection to acceptable levels and making rioting worthwhile.
Thus, small changes in beliefs can set off a riot as society jumps
from one equilibrium to another.16
It is already clear that economists feel comfortable extending
standard analysis to consider issues that involve society as a
whole or some subset of it. Whether noneconomists are eventually
persuaded that our approach is useful remains to be seen.
15. There is a supply side to this story as well. High crime neighborhoods may
warrant a greater police presence, which works in the opposite direction. Economies of scale in detection play an important role in determining the direction of the
net effect.
16. As with all models that rely on multiple equilibria, the story is incomplete.
The existence of multiple equilibria means that something is absent from the
model that determines which of the equilibria prevails. In this context, missing is a
model of beliefs and changes in them over time.

Religion
If bringing economics to bear on the analysis of the family
seems disrespectful, applying it to religion is downright dangerous, given the power of higher authorities. Yet economics has
made an impact on religion, and the work by Lawrence Iannaccone, in particular, is viewed by those who study religion as a
social phenomenon as one of the (newly) established schools of
thought.17
There are at least two ways to bring economic thinking into a
discussion of religion. One is to simply assume that religion enters
the utility function. Treating religion in this way relegates it to
being simply one of many important industries, and it is the
approach followed by Azzi and Ehrenberg [1975], who study
religiosity. Their model of church attendance addresses the problem as one of investment under uncertainty, where the uncertain
event is entering heaven. Although the predictions of the theory
are empirically verifiable (e.g., older people should be more likely
to attend church), the validity of the underlying assumptions is
impossible to determine in the current life.
An alternative is to view religion as changing preferences or
prices in a more fundamental way. This is Iannaccone’s approach.
Iannaccone uses agency theory to model the practices of religious
groups. Specifically, Iannaccone [1992] argues that free-rider
effects were important in religious groups and that they had to
find ways to deal with these effects. One method is to lower the
value of alternatives, thereby increasing commitment to the
group. By changing the prices or alternatives, the budget constraint is shifted, inducing individuals to take actions that are
better for the group in question. Thus, Hari Krishnas, by dressing
in unusual ways, make themselves unacceptable to others, which
decreases the incentives to spend time engaged in activity outside
the Hari Krishna circle. A similar point is made by Max Weber
[1946, 1970, originally 1906–1924]. Kosher laws followed by Jews
make it impossible for them to accept invitations to eat in
nonkosher households, thereby restricting their contact to other
kosher Jews. Recently, Berman [1998], used the Iannaccone
model to explain puzzling fertility rate changes and labor force
participation behavior among ultra-orthodox Jews. Related, un17. North [1981] argues that ‘‘any successful ideology must overcome the
free-rider problem’’ and argues that modeling the free-rider problem is key to
building a positive theory of laws and institutions.

usual dress codes and costly practices provide a screen (e.g., the
Amish). Individuals signal their commitment to the group by
acceding to the group’s dress codes and other restrictions.
THE THEORY

OF THE

FIRM

Just as consumer theory can be taken to a deeper level of
analysis, so too can economists penetrate the standard concepts
used in production theory to extend the boundaries of economics.
This can be done in a few ways.
First, the quality of factors of production can be viewed as
endogenous. The most direct application of this kind of thinking
opened up the economics of education.
Second, the nature of the interactions between various agents
can be modeled and studied. Economists are no longer content
with writing down a production function and assuming that the
nature of that function is the scope of engineering or organizational behavior. Alfred Marshall’s famous statement that it is not
the business of the economist to tell the brewer how to make beer
is less true today than it was in his day. Imperialistic economists
are anxious to get inside the brewing process. Although not
literally true, economists now see it as their task to understand
how various production technologies and interactions can arise.
Third, the notion that firms simply maximize profits is no
longer sufficient. Economists now want to know how it is done.
What is the method used to monopolize a market and to choose
which products to produce?
Although these questions that relate to the firm may seem to
be closer to the main topics that economics has studied, we should
not take for granted that these areas were open to economists.
Indeed, for most of this century, other social sciences controlled
this territory.
Surprisingly, scholars in the area in which economics would
seem to be most applicable, namely the study and analysis of
business, have avoided using economics until recent decades.
There are still some holdouts. In some famous business schools,
basic microeconomics is not even part of the curriculum.18 Perhaps as a result of the high level of abstraction, economics was not
thought to be applicable to business issues. The view was that
economics was not practical. Economic analysis has only recently
18. Harvard Business School is an important example.

changed that view and has made its mark in finance, accounting,
marketing, human resources and industrial relations, the theory
of organizations, and business strategy. By now, despite some
laggards, the impact of economics on the study of business is
profound. Economics has genuinely altered the way that business
research and education is conducted.
Economic theory’s slow entrance in business was in part a
fault of economics itself. Economists, as scholars, have emphasized the positive aspects of economics and eschewed the normative (see Friedman [1953]). Business is in large part normative
because the goal of a business education is not so much to explain
the world, but to run it. Thus, much of the contribution of
economics to both the study and teaching of business has been a
result of translating positive lessons into normative ones.
The impact of economics has not been confined to the study of
business. Economics has made its mark on the business community itself. An obvious example of this is the Black-Scholes
formula for option pricing. Options are now priced in the market
very much in line with the Black-Scholes formula. The fact that
people believe that this is the correct way to price options forces
market prices to conform to this formula, whether they did so
before or not. Consulting firms borrow concepts from economics
and sell them to their clients. For example, compensation consultants price jobs based on their nonpecuniary attributes. These
concepts on which the method is based date back to Smith’s
Wealth of Nations.19 Yet consulting firms still reject economics as
being fundamental to understanding business and advising clients. These firms are filled with psychologists and others with
broad managerial training. Things are changing over time, however, as economists have shown that they have a different, but
insightful way of looking at issues that have been of traditional
concern to the firms’ clients.
Determining the Quality of Labor
The theory of human capital is the most important contribution to determining the quality of labor inputs. Human capital
theory, especially as it was applied to education, opened up a new
area of inquiry and is strong evidence of the power of the economic
framework. The three names most important here are Jacob
19. See Smith [1986, originally 1776] Book I, Chapter 10 on wage differences
that compensate for job characteristics.

Mincer [1958], T. W. Schultz [1959,1961,1963], and again Becker
[1960a,1962,1975]. Forty years later, it is obvious that education
can be thought of as an investment that affects the quality of
labor. It was not so obvious at the time. The notion that humans
were capital was anathema to many inside the economics community as well as out.
The costs of education are somewhat subtle. As in the area of
demography, recognizing that a large part of the cost of education
consists of forgone earnings provided key insights into understanding the distribution of schooling across a population. The fact that
the young are more likely to go to school than the old is derived in
part from this point. Because the opportunity cost of a child’s time
is low, this is the ideal time to invest. (It also allows the greatest
payoff period.) Prime-age workers rarely drop out of work to
attend school even if attendance would increase their earnings.
They simply cannot afford to do so because the opportunity cost of
forgone wages is too high.
Both equilibrium and efficiency drive a number of the results
associated with the economics of education. Initially, economists
worried that there was too little investment in education because
the rate of return to schooling exceeded what most thought of as
the rate of return on other investments. Some then claimed that
the reverse was true: as a result of increased enrollment in
schools, done to avoid military service during the Vietnam War,
the rate of return to schooling plummeted during the seventies,
only to return to its highest historical level by the time of this
writing (see Freeman [1976]). The importance of the economic
approach to education is that it gives social scientists a way to
think about who would acquire education, when education would
be acquired, and it guides social policy by providing a method for
determining the optimal level of schooling. No other social science
has delivered the same implications or prescriptions.
The extension of economics into education had spillover
effects. The earnings equation that Mincer derived in the late
1950s stated that
ln (Earnings) ⫽ a ⫹ r (Schooling).
This function or some variation of it has probably been estimated
more times, by more researchers, and on more different data sets
than any other relation in economics. It generated an enormous
interest in analyzing cross-sectional and panel data sets and was
a force behind the acquisition of some of the data collected during

the 1960s and 1970s. A consequence of this kind of analysis was
the refinement of econometric techniques and an emphasis on
serious statistical analysis. Of course, serious statistics are not
without their precedents in labor and consumer economics. For
example, Friedman and Kuznets [1945] is a masterpiece in
combining economic theory with data analysis. But the work in
human capital gave impetus to the collection of new kinds of data,
which made economics far more empirical than it had been in the
past. Furthermore, the intensity and quality of empirical analysis
gave credibility to the results obtained by economists that surpassed that earned by scholars in other fields.
No one can doubt the impact that human capital theory has
had on other fields. Scholars in education now think of the model
as mainstream. The National Science Foundation is currently
funding a major project in understanding human capital. Even
the business press features articles on human capital. It has
taken over the way that most social scientists model education
and the quality of labor.
Personnel Economics
Human resource executives are often regarded as the lowest
form of managerial life. The same has been true of those academics who study human resources. There is a reason: historically, the
field was loose talk. It was descriptive. It was ad hoc. It lacked
positive predictions or reliable normative prescriptions. The older
analysts focused much of their attention on industrial relations,
which has all but died as unions have become less important in
the American labor market.
Human resource management is today where finance was
twenty years ago. Recently having become rigorous, both research
and teaching in the field have been influenced, if not taken over,
by economics. Industrial relations has been replaced at the top
business schools by personnel economics. The difference between
this approach and earlier human resources research is that the
economic approach emphasizes maximization and rational decision-making by workers, competition in labor markets, and
efficiency in labor contracting.
Personnel economics uses economic analysis to model the
relationships between workers, managers, and owners. It is an
attempt to move inside the profit maximization equation to
determine how labor supply is elicited, who has incentives to do
what to whom, and how firms can best make decisions about the

use of factors of productions. It is somewhat more normative than
many traditional economics fields in that it reasons through
complicated incentive problems, partly with the goal of informing
managers. It is for this reason that it was started by individuals
whose primary appointment was in business schools.
It is instructive to contrast the approach of the personnel
economist with that of more traditional human resource scholars.
Let me offer an example. One area in which economics has direct
application is in determination of turnover and layoff policy.
Economists naturally think about issues involving market competition and appropriate matching. These ideas may be implicit in
old-style human resources, but they are never dealt with in a
systematic way, in large part because the disciplines from which
human resources scholars were traditionally drawn do not have a
framework for analyzing these issues. Among the more analytic
and respected of the human resources authors is George Milkovich. In his text with John Boudreau [1988, p. 327], turnover is
discussed as follows:
Many employment planners establish specific rates of turnover (or
patterns of mobility) as an objective. Subsequently, personnel programs are
designed to achieve the objective. Looking again at Kodak, it designed early
retirement programs to encourage older, experienced, and more expensive
employees to leave. It also designed layoffs and instituted a recruiting
freeze. . . . Whether to seek increased or decreased turnover rates depends on
the circumstances faced by the organization.

Although there is little that is controversial in this statement,
there is also no guidance as to when to lay workers off, whom to lay
off, what is a desirable turnover rate, and how does it vary with
economic conditions. Contrast this with the approach that economists use [Lazear 1998, Ch. 1]. The economic approach focuses on
profit maximization and on efficiency. The efficiency rule can be
stated as follows: a worker should be kept whenever his productivity at the current firm, Q, exceeds the value of his alternatives, A.
This can be broken down into two statements. A firm wants to lay
off a worker whenever the wage W exceeds Q. The worker wants to
quit whenever W ⬍ A. In situations where the worker has rights to
his job, the framework provides a rule for successful buyouts,
which is another manifestation of the Coase theorem. Whenever
Q ⬍ A, there exists the possibility of a buyout. The worker earns
rent W ⫺ A by staying. The firm loses rent W ⫺ Q by having the
worker stay. Thus, the firm is willing to pay B ⱕ W ⫺ Q to have the
worker leave. The worker will accept B8 ⱖ W ⫺ A to go. A

ECONOMIC IMPERIALISM

121

successful buyout exists whenever B ⬍ B8, the offer exceeds the
demand, or whenever
W ⫺ A ⬍ W ⫺ Q.
This can be rewritten as
A ⬎ Q,
which is the efficiency condition. A successful buyout offer can
always be made whenever it is efficient for the worker to go
elsewhere.
Of course, estimating the values of A and Q may be a difficult
task. But the old HR approach has the same difficulty. Anytime a
layoff decision is made, the firm is saying that it views the
worker’s net output as less than his wage. The economic approach
does this explicitly and gets the decision rule correct at the outset.
The economic approach to turnover is very different from the
traditional HR approach. The economic approach focuses on
efficiency, competition and market equilibrium, and profit and
utility maximization. It provides many more implications for
specific rules of turnover than does the HR approach. It dictates
that layoffs occur not when things are bad at any particular firm,
but when things are worse there than elsewhere. It also implies
that young individuals and older ones are most likely to separate
because the young have little firm-specific human capital and the
old have alternative uses of time that are close to the value of their
productivity on the job.20 Finally, it prescribes a specific structure
of buyouts that will be successful for targeted workers.
The difference between the way that economists and other
social scientists think about personnel issues is illustrated by the
following example.
The CEO of a major financial services firm recently stated
that in a survey of the firm’s workers, one finding was ubiquitous
at offices throughout the world. Workers said that they would
prefer better working conditions to more money in their current
jobs. Critics of the economic approach often delight in facts like
this, which they often believe negates the economic approach that
places such heavy emphasis on money. An industrial psychologist
might argue that improved working conditions signal to the
worker that the firm cares about the worker’s welfare and creates
20. Efficient retirement occurs at the age when the value of alternatives just
equals the value of productivity on the job. Workers who were paid their marginal
products would retire voluntarily at the efficient age.

a feeling of family and loyalty. There may be truth to this, but the
economist would take a harder line. First, the economist might
point out the question was not well-posed. It is first necessary to
specify whether the improved working conditions cost more or less
than the additional money offered to the worker. It would hardly
be surprising to find that firm spending of $50,000 on improved
worker conditions for a given worker is preferred to an increase of,
say, $1000. Unlike other social scientists, the economist asks ‘‘at
what price or cost?’’ Second, even if the comparison were between
working conditions and benefits that cost the same amount, they
should have equal value to the worker at the optimum. At the
optimum, a dollar spent on working conditions should produce the
same utility for a worker as a dollar spent on salary. If a dollar
spent on working conditions produces more utility, then resources
should be transferred from salary to working conditions until the
worker is indifferent between the two. The finding reported by the
CEO that improved working conditions are preferred to money
simply reveals that this firm is not at the optimum and should
transfer resources from salary to working conditions. The reverse
could just as well be true at other firms that overspend on office
furniture.
Personnel economics deals with interactions that are inside
the firm in a rigorous way. The field, which applies labor and
microeconomics to human resource management, has had a large
impact on the literature and is having an impact on teaching.
Whether it will come to dominate the field in the same way that
economics has dominated finance remains to be seen.
Whereas human capital theory and personnel economics have
helped delve deeper into the understanding of labor within the
firm, modern finance has made much progress in rationalizing the
study of capital usage. To some, this may not seem like imperialism at all. What could be a more natural part of economic theory
than finance? Although seemingly obvious, it took some energetic
economic pioneers to wrest the field away from the traditional
management types who owned the discipline until the sixties.
Prominent among these earlier researchers was Merton
Miller. Miller’s contribution was to discover that because changes
in capital structure do not alter the flow of earnings over time,
altering the division of the firm’s liabilities between stocks and
bonds leaves the total value of the firm unchanged. When asked
about his contribution with Franco Modigliani to understanding
finance, Miller remarked, ‘‘If I take a pizza and cut it into eight

ECONOMIC IMPERIALISM

123

pieces, it’s still a pizza.’’ This insight was one of the first building
blocks of modern finance [Modigliani and Miller 1958]. Not all
financial economists accept the reasoning of the M&M theorem,
but even its doubters have been influenced by it to look into areas
of corporate governance and incomplete markets that might affect
interpretation of the theory.
There are a few other individuals who are noteworthy. Harry
Markowitz’s [1952] early analysis of portfolio choice, William
Sharpe’s [1964] capital asset pricing model, Eugene Fama’s [1970]
work on efficient markets, and the already-mentioned BlackScholes formula are the groundwork on which much of the
research in modern finance is based. Work in finance during the
fifties and early sixties focused attention on capital budgeting,
much of which can be traced back to early treatises on the time
value of money, especially by Irving Fisher [1930]. More modern
asset pricing research, however, owes much of its existence to the
economic theory provided by economists mentioned above.
Their theories were a major break from the institutional
finance that used to be the subject of business teaching and
analysis. Absent economic theory, with maximizing agents, equilibrium, and efficiency, financial scholars spent much of their time
describing the institutions such as banks that prevailed in
markets and trying to understand their differences and similarities. Much of the material was classificatory, grouping certain
assets into some categories and other assets into other categories.
The new finance broke away from this approach by keying in on
both equilibrium and efficiency.
The simple concept of arbitrage made much of the work
possible. Although arbitrage does not always guarantee efficiency,
it was the concentration on economic efficiency, maximization,
and equilibrium that induced financial theorists to think in terms
of arbitrage conditions and thereby change the direction of
finance. The Black-Scholes options pricing formula, widely used
in the business world as well as in academia, exploits the concept
of arbitrage in a sophisticated way. Understanding that constraints were placed on prices by the ability to trade assets that
were identical or equivalent to the ones in question imposed
discipline on economic predictions. The assumption that market
agents maximize profits by engaging in particular trades was a
straightforward and powerful engine that yielded results. Market
equilibrium based on standard supply and demand analysis

replaced institutional taxonomies for determining the linkages
between securities.
The effects of the introduction of economic theory and econometric analysis into finance have been powerful. Finance is
viewed as the premier field in business schools and attracts some
of the finest talent in the profession. (In addition to the Nobel
Laureates listed above, note that two of the last seven winners of
the John Bates Clark Medal are financial economists.) Finance
has relevance to the real world; it has mathematical and statistical sophistication; it is important in terms of spillovers to and
from other branches of economics and, as a result, commands
great respect as a discipline. It is no wonder that finance has
experienced a meteoric rise in status, especially in the research
community, over the past three decades. Neither is economists’
takeover of the field of finance a given, nor is it an obvious
extension of traditional economics. Just as sociologists argue that
institutions are more important in determining individual behavior than is maximization given constraints, management professors who taught finance believed that institutions were the key to
understanding finance and financial institutions. They controlled
the field and rejected the idea that economic theory could inform
their discipline. They have been replaced by financial economists,
almost to the person.
Accounting
If finance sits atop the altar of business research, accounting
is the ancient language of the temple. Almost every manager who
has had even a rudimentary business education has at least a
basic knowledge of elementary accounting. Terms such as assets
and liabilities, credit and debit, and the simple balance sheet are
standard in business vernacular. Like finance, until recent years,
accounting was a field rich in description, but lacking rigorous
theory. That started to change perhaps three decades ago, and the
departure from the old style of analysis in accounting has
accelerated in recent years.
Accounting is a field that is a natural to be informed by
economics, but like finance, the resistance was great, and inroads
were made only recently. Economics was so absent from accounting that the two fields had very different concepts of profit, which
led to significant confusion. Businesspersons often have a difficult
time understanding why any firm would be in business simply to
earn zero profit, neglecting the fact that economic profit allows a

ECONOMIC IMPERIALISM

125

normal return on capital and to managerial labor. The economist’s
definition is the one that comes from a notion of equilibrium; the
accountant’s definition a usage of the term that is unrelated to
equilibrium.
Much of the change in accounting came about as the awareness of information economics grew. Since accounting is for the
most part about information, breakthroughs in the theory of
information had direct application to accounting. This showed up
most dramatically in managerial accounting. There came to be a
recognition that the kind of information that is most useful for
guiding decisions is not necessarily the kind of information that
was reported to or required by governmental agencies. Decisionmaking requires a sophisticated understanding of costs and
knowing what to do with the information. Allocating costs to
various units or activities in firms poses deep theoretical and
empirical challenges. Microeconomics provided guidance in the
middle of this century to those trying to decide whether costs
should be regarded as fixed or variable and what the classification
implied for build or scrap decisions (see Horngren, Sundem, and
Elliott [1999]). Information and personnel economics provided
insight into other kinds of decisions problems. Transfer pricing
provides incentives to divisions and managers to behave in ways
that can make the firm better off, but setting the prices correctly
or choosing to use implicit rather than explicit systems requires a
sophisticated understanding of economic mechanisms. Modern
accountants now possess that understanding.
Second, accountants have come to realize that accounting
statements are not the only determinant of market valuation.
This derives from an awareness of asset-pricing mechanisms by
knowledge of modern finance and the economics that created it.
Much of the empirical accounting literature over the past two
decades is concerned with the kind of information that is most
likely to affect market valuation (see Beaver [1968]).
Finally, a large part of accounting is normative. It provides
guidance for managers and sometimes for policy-makers. Various
agencies use the work of accountants to guide their policies on
rules that firms must follow. Since the analyses are based in large
part on economic reasoning, economics has altered policy.21 For
21. The Federal Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has been caught in the
middle of a battle between academic accountants and businesspersons for the past
ten years over whether the expected value of options should be deducted from

example, one question is whether a regulatory agency like the IRS
should announce or conceal its audit rules. If rules are announced,
then firms know what they can get away with and what they
cannot. This will induce them to take actions that they might have
been afraid to take if the rule had remained secret. But making
the audit rule clear also means that transgressions that might
have occurred if the rule had been kept secret will be completely
eliminated by publicizing that such behavior will result in certain
punishment. No cheating on the audited items occurs when the
rule is announced.
Modern accounting scholars now use the language and tools
of economics. Agency theory,22 information economics, and economic notions of equilibria and pricing are used in cost accounting. The fact that young accountants, who possess the new skills
that make heavy use of economics, are in such demand by
business schools is testimony to the impact of economics on the
field.
STRATEGY
Until very recently, economists assumed that they had little
to say about the optimal strategy of the firm. Emphasizing
positive economics, economists generally shunned making normative prescriptions. Rather, the direction was the reverse. Businesspeople were assumed to know what they were doing. The
economist’s job was only to document it and to explain the
behavior in a systematic way. That goal still remains noble, but it
has been broadened.
The field of business strategy was never part of economics
proper. Even Adam Smith did not include it among the topics that
he discussed. Twenty years ago, research in business strategy
(sometimes called business policy) meant studying the composition and behavior of boards of directors. The analysis was much
like Kremlin watching in the former Soviet Union. Who sat next to
whom at the board table was noted with significance and the
importance of liaisons was emphasized. Much of the change is a
direct result of Porter’s [1980] book, which took the positive
economics of industrial organization and made it normative.
impacts will not be significant because the market will see through the change in
accounting rules. Firms that grant options are adamantly opposed to such a
change.

[1984].

Porter used what we know about vertical integration, monopoly, and pricing and translated it into rules or lists of factors
that businesspersons could follow. Some view this as mere intellectual arbitrage. To do so is equivalent to denigrating a producer for
merely copying and improving an existing product. By making a
product better and cheaper, the follower may generate the lion’s
share of consumer surplus. In a similar vein, business strategy
scholars have done much to improve our understanding of business by taking theories that were positive in nature and applying
them in a more normative context. And there is no doubt that they
have succeeded. Strategic management as a field is now applied
industrial organization, where the appropriate boundaries of the
firm, product choice, where, when, and along which dimensions to
compete, are all studied systematically. Previously missing, but
now at the heart of the field, is the assumption of profit maximization by firms, working out market equilibria as a result of
engaging in a particular strategy, and efficiency considerations.
Game theory has added much to the discussion of strategy
issues. The language used in game theory is the same as that of
business strategy. In game theory, as in strategy, attention is paid
to economic efficiency. Business strategy is a process-oriented
field. Game theory is attractive, not only because it allows the
derivation of equilibria where the standard models were unsatisfactory, but also because it focuses more on process than the old
competitive model.23 The Walrasian auctioneer was an analytic
fiction to make us feel more comfortable about the process that
generated a result we believed in. Game theory and mechanismdesign analyses place much more emphasis on process than the
competitive model and the stories seem realistic. When we
consider two firms interacting with one another in a market,
prisoner’s dilemma scenarios seem to vividly capture the nature of
at least some interaction. When we think about firms that are
fighting over a standard to be selected for the industry, the
battle-of-the-sexes framework seems to be more than just a
metaphor. But herein lies the danger, which shows up in business
strategy literature. Because the models of the process are so
realistic, scholars are often content with results that imply
inefficiencies. Rather than asking whether the selection of the
strategy space has ruled out efficiency-enhancing trades, modelers sometimes stop too soon and do not question whether there is a
23. This is especially true when considering oligopoly.

pattern to the inefficiencies that might be explained by a more
complete theory. Standard competitive theory is less likely to lead
to this conclusion because almost no weight is placed on the
process, instead the focus is on the equilibrium itself. An example
is instructive.
Suppose that a firm is engaged in a long-term trading
relationship with a supplier. Since the relationship has bilateral
monopoly aspects to it, one possible way to model this is to allow
the supplier to demand a particular price and to allow the buyer to
accept or reject. This is not an unrealistic description of the
process that might occur in the real world. Let the value of the
input to the purchaser be M, distributed F(M ), and the reservation price of the supplier be C, where C is known to all. Suppose
that the supplier does not know the realization of M, but knows
the distribution F(M ). The supplier’s problem is then to announce
a demand price P to solve
max [1 ⫺ F(P)](P ⫺ C),
P

since the producer accepts the supplier’s price whenever M ⬎ P or
(1 ⫺ F(P)) of the time. The solution is
P ⫽ C ⫹ (1 ⫺ F(P)/f (P).
This is monopoly pricing and results in an inefficiency. Because
the supplier is trying to maximize its own surplus, it announces a
demand that exceeds its reservation price. Inefficiency results in
those situations when P ⬎ M ⬎ C. Trade does not occur because
P ⬎ C; i.e., the price is set above the reservation value. Trade
should occur because M ⬎ C; i.e., the value of the trade is positive.
The inefficiency results, however, because the strategy space
is not sufficiently rich. The seemingly realistic structure disguises
the fact that there is room for trade that eliminates the inefficiency. Since C is known to all, the solution is to sell the power to
set price to the producer who is the buyer of the input, not to the
supplier who is the seller of the input. The producer pays a
retainer to the supplier, which determines the share of rent that
goes to each party. All trades take place at price C, which the
supplier always accepts. Whenever M ⬎ C, the producer offers the
supplier C. When M ⬍ C, no offer is made, and no trade occurs.
This eliminates all inefficiency since the producer buys if and only
if C ⬍ M.
Concentrating on the process rather than the equilibrium is

more common in other social sciences. There, constraints are
accepted as part of the problem’s description, and researchers are
unlikely to ask whether there are incentives to relax the assumed
constraints in order to eliminate an inefficiency. If not, why not?
Perhaps the inefficiencies are minimal and of little social
consequence.

OTHER BUSINESS SCHOOL DISCIPLINES
Organizational behavior (OB) as a discipline is at the opposite
end of the spectrum from economics. Whereas economics is
precise, rigorous, and willing to abstract from details, organizational behavior is rich in description of details and empirically
observed phenomena, but loose and without a parsimonious
framework. Economists love to generalize. OB scholars like to
focus on differences. Most important, economists who examine the
issues assume maximization that must be consistent with an
equilibrium. Researchers in organizational behavior feel no such
compulsion and are generally put off by the notion that individuals are rational and maximize.
Economists have begun to have an impact on the way that
organizational behavior is researched and taught. Work by Williamson [1975], Milgrom and Roberts [1992], Brickley, Smith, and
Zimmerman [1997], and most recently Jensen [1998], brings
economic reasoning to bear on questions of organizational structure. For example, Milgrom and Roberts emphasize efficiency at
the outset of their book. Efficiency considerations determine
whether firms operate using a system of transfer prices or
whether they operate using quotas. Milgrom and Roberts emphasize brittleness, which is a measure of the amount by which
expected profits decline when a manager has imperfect information (see p. 94). Their approach represents a clear break from the
organizational behavior tradition. ‘‘Brittleness’’ is not what an OB
scholar would make central. While economists already take this
as an appropriate model of the internal workings of the firm,
organizational behaviorists, with a few exceptions, have not yet
signed on.
Economics has influenced empirical analyses done by sociologists in the area of organizations. Thus, two sociologists, Baron
and Hannan [1994], summarize the work of sociologists who have
studied promotion and incentive systems, the economic models of
tournaments, internal labor markets and acquisition of human

capital, agency theory, and worker-firm matches. The fact that
there is a literature to summarize attests to some influence that
economics has had on this neighboring field.
Marketing has always been a field dominated by psychology,
not economics. Like most of the fields that have been the target of
economic imperialism, the field was not studied by economists
because we have traditionally held the view that to understand
marketing, it is necessary to understand taste formation. Since
economists generally have been reluctant to discuss taste formation, it is not surprising that economists have not played a
significant role in marketing. Nor is it obvious that economics is
well suited to discussing the kinds of issues that are central to
marketing. Still, economists have tried to analyze some of the
more market-oriented aspects of the field, and some have gone
beyond to model tastes and advertising (see Becker and Murphy
[2000]). Clearly, pricing policies, bundling practices, and retail/
wholesale relationships can all be informed by economics. For the
most part, marketing scholars have been affected by economics
primarily by encouraging sophisticated econometric analyses.
There are a number of areas in which economics has had
strong impacts. Application of standard price-theoretic and gametheoretic models to marketing are summarized in Moorthy [1993],
Rao [1993], and Blattberg and Neslin [1993]. They include
analyses of price competition, promotions (i.e., sales), advertising
competition as an arms-race phenomenon, and media scheduling
as a jumping-the-gun phenomenon [Roth et al. 1994]. Finally,
incentive models from personnel economics have been used to
understand sales force compensation (see Coughlan [1993]). Most
of these are inherently economic and are imperialistic only in the
sense that individuals who studied and taught marketing would
not have been willing to use these approaches twenty years ago.
Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that five out of eighteen chapters in
a recent handbook of marketing are devoted to economic analyses
or applications thereof.

The impact of economics has not been confined to digging
more deeply into the standard economic constructs. Economics
has affected thought in other fields, most notably law, politics, and
health.

Law
Half a century ago, the cornerstones for the field of law and
economics were being laid at the University of Chicago’s Law
School. An early pioneer, Aaron Director, set much of the tone for
the work that followed. Again, the familiar themes were present.
Maximizing behavior, equilibrium, and efficiency all played a role.
The most celebrated result in all of law and economics is the Coase
theorem [Coase 1960], which is a powerful use of the concept of
efficiency. The Coase theorem states that in the absence of
transactions costs, the allocation of resources will be unaffected by
the assignment of property rights. Although the distribution of
income is affected, the nature of production is not. When there are
no transaction costs, the welfare-maximizing allocation is obtained.
The Coase theorem is perhaps the best example of the old saw
that important results are first claimed to be incorrect and then
asserted to be obvious. The various interpretations of the Coase
theorem provided a number of useful directions for economics to
follow. Because the result is so profound, many concluded that one
interpretation of the theorem is that transactions costs must be
very important because the allocation of resources does seem to be
affected by property rights. Many economists have built their
careers thinking about the impact of transactions costs on economic behavior.24
More important is that legal scholars have been influenced by
the Coase theorem. The focus of the work by Richard Posner
[1972], Frank Easterbrook and Daniel Fischel [1991], and Richard
Epstein [1985] is efficiency.25 Posner especially has viewed the law
as in large part attempting to bring about efficient outcomes. This
was a radical concept. The idea that the law should deal with
efficiency rather than ‘‘justice’’ was a bitter pill for legal scholars to
swallow.26 An example from contract law is useful.
Consider a woman who signs a contract with a builder to have
a new house constructed. She agrees to pay him x at the time of
completion. After signing the contract, the builder is presented
with an alternative that has value z to him. The builder breaches
his contract with the woman and accepts the alternative. The
woman who retained the builder initially can have the house
24. Williamson [1999] is a well-respected case in point.
25. Actually, Epstein [1985] questions whether efficiency is sufficient or
whether the law should take into account implementability.
26. See Kaplow and Shavell [1998] for an argument that efficiency is the only
reasonable definition of justice.

constructed by another builder, but at a cost of y ⬎ x. The house is
actually worth v ⱖ x to the woman. How much should the builder
who breached the contract be required to pay? One obvious choice
is to order the contract violator to pay the difference between
replacement cost and contract price, i.e., to pay of y ⫺ x. Another
choice is to order him to pay the difference between the value to
the buyer and contract price, i.e., a payment of v ⫺ x.
The economically efficient solution is to require the builder to
pay v ⫺ x in compensatory damages. The fact that the builder
accepted the alternative tells us that z ⬎ x. But efficiency requires
that the builder turn down the alternative unless z ⬎ v because
social value is maximized by having the builder spend his time in
the highest valued use. If the builder is required to pay y ⫺ x in
damages, he will breach the contract if and only if
z ⫺ ( y ⫺ x) ⬎ x
because he receives z, but pays ( y ⫺ x) for a breach. If he honors
the contract, he receives x. This simplifies to breaching if and only
if
(1)

z ⬎ y.

If, instead, the builder is required to pay v ⫺ x, then he will breach
if and only if
z ⫺ (v ⫺ x) ⬎ x
or if
(2)

z ⬎ v.

Expression (2) guarantees efficiency. Expression (1) does not.
Specifically, there might be situations where the cost of having the
house built by another builder far exceeds its value to the woman.
Consider the situation where y ⬎ z ⬎ v. Rule (1) would cause the
builder to honor his contract with the woman when a breach
would actually be efficient. Because y ⬎ z, the builder honors the
contract. But this is inefficient since z ⬎ v. The value of the
alternative use of the builder’s time exceeds the value to the
woman of having the house built. Forcing the builder to pay only
the difference between the value to the buyer and the agreed-upon
price is tantamount to requiring (2), which simply states the
efficiency criterion. This is always the correct rule.
The law requires reimbursement for damages, not for replace-

ECONOMIC IMPERIALISM

133

ment cost.27 Reasonableness rules are consistent with this. The
prohibition of requiring specific performance under most circumstances is an example of efficiency in this context. Take an
extreme case where there is no alternative builder who could
build the house. Thus, y is infinite. The court could not require
infinite payment in damages, but it could compel the builder to
honor the contract. This would amount to specific performance,
which is prohibited in labor contracts. Instead, the contractor
would be responsible for damages, equal to the difference between
the value to the woman of the house and the negotiated price.
Ironically, the Coase theorem taken to its logical conclusion
implies that the court’s damages rule should not affect efficiency.
Even when the builder is required to pay y ⫺ x in damages, an
efficient breach can occur. The woman knows that the builder will
not breach when damages are y ⫺ x. But she can agree to permit
the breach at some price greater than v ⫺ x but less than z ⫺ x. As
long as z ⬎ v, which is the condition for efficiency, a deal of this sort
can be struck. Thus, even if the court adopts an inefficient rule,
the Coase theorem implies that it will have no effect on efficiency
absent transactions costs. The key is the phrase ‘‘absent transactions costs.’’ The existence of courts may be evidence that transactions costs are positive and substantial. Alternatively, they may
merely reflect the attempt by the various parties to affect the
distribution of rents, independent of the allocation of resources.
A natural outgrowth of the interest in law is an interest in
incentives that are created by the law. In particular, deterrence
associated with penalties for committing crimes is a primary goal
of any punishment system. How large is the deterrent effect that
is associated with any particular penalty? Becker [1968] modeled
deterrence in an expected cost framework. The key insight is that
the criminal cares about the expected penalty, defined as the
product of the size of the penalty and the probability of having the
penalty imposed.28 This simple point provided strong normative
27. Sometimes damages are equal to replacement cost. This occurs when x ⬍
y ⬍ v ⬍ z. In this situation, the house can be built by a third party at a cost less
than the woman’s value of the house. Efficiency requires that the woman accept
the offer to build at cost less than v. Efficiency also requires that the original
contractor take his alternative because z exceeds v. Thus, the general rule should
be that the penalty for a breach should be equal to the smaller of replacement cost
or the value of the house to the contracting party.
28. It is actually the change in the probability as a function of committing the
crime that is relevant. If a court system imposes high penalties randomly, then the
penalty has no deterrent effect at all. Deterrence comes from the change in the
expected penalty associated with committing a crime.

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

implications. Since detection is imperfect, it is necessary to
overpenalize the convicted. Having the penalty fit the crime
results in too little deterrence if this is interpreted to mean that
the penalty be equal to the damages caused. Efficiency requires
that the penalty should be inflated by the reciprocal of the
probability of conviction.29
This framework was used in a number of empirical studies to
determine the effect of various policies on deterrence. Among the
best known and most controversial is the analysis by Ehrlich
[1975] of the effect of the death penalty on murder rates. Ehrlich
found strong deterrent effects, and this evidence has been used to
bolster the case for capital punishment.
Economists gained insight into deterrent effects by assuming
rationality. Even criminal behavior, which many believe to be
inherently irrational, was modeled as a rational process where
individuals maximize utility and take punishment into account in
a rational way. Pushing the notion that individuals maximize
utility provided guidance, rigor, and specificity that was lacking in
other disciplines’ approach to analysis of criminal behavior.
The economists’ approach to the law has indirect spillovers. I
have argued that etiquette is simply a way by which society
enforces rules that lead to efficient behavior as an extension of the
notion that the law promotes efficiency [Lazear 1993]. Etiquette is
law where custom substitutes for courts. For example, etiquette
dictates that a young person give his seat to an older one on a
crowded bus. This is efficient because the gains from sitting to the
older person exceed the costs of standing to the younger one. In
poor societies, etiquette dictates that working men eat first and
children receive what is left. This is not the general pattern in
wealthier societies. When a family is close to subsistence, investing calories in working men may be the best way to ensure the
family’s survival. In wealthy societies, investments in children
and women may be more efficient.
Another example relates to professional etiquette. Orr [1993]
states that it is poor department etiquette to dump committee
work on junior faculty. This is consistent with efficiency since
29. There are some complications to this simple rule. A risk-averse society
may not want such a severe penalty rule when there is some probability of
convicting an innocent person. Furthermore, since it is marginal considerations
that are important, imposing too large a penalty for small crimes reduces the
deterrence for larger crimes. For example, if the penalty for stealing a loaf of bread
is execution, then the thief might be attempted to kill a policeman to escape
because the penalty for murder is no worse.

comparative advantage in committee work rests with senior, not
junior faculty. Finally, law journals allow simultaneous submission of papers. Economics journals require that a paper be
submitted exclusively to one journal at a time. Law articles are
refereed by students who view the task as education. Economics
articles are refereed by more senior scholars, whose time is more
valuable. The differences in etiquette across fields can be explained by efficiency.30 Thus, economists may even have an impact
on Miss Manners.
The influence of economics on legal scholarship has been
substantial. Landes and Posner [1992] document its growth over
the 1980s. By counting citations to particular economists associated with law and economics, they find that citations in law
journals increased from 283 between 1976 and 1980 to 2227
between 1986 and 1990.
Political Economy
It has never been much of stretch between economics and
politics. Historians, political scientists, and economists alike have
believed that economics can exert a strong influence on politics,
both at the national and international levels. This connection,
however, has nothing to do with economic imperialism. Economic
imperialism in the realm of political economy consists of the use of
economic methods to understand political processes. In earlier
times, the two were inseparable. The Mercantilists, Physiocrats,
and Adam Smith focused much of their attention on the relation of
economics to politics. Modern economists have returned to some of
the same themes, but in a somewhat different way. Two early
works in this area are Schelling’s [1960] The Strategy of Conflict
and Buchanan and Tullock’s [1962] The Calculus of Consent.
Schelling uses early game theory to analyze the interaction
between political entities. Much of the work considers international relations. Key is that Schelling emphasizes rational choice
based on maximization. Schelling writes, ‘‘Threats and responses
to threats, reprisals and counter-reprisals, limited war, arms
races, brinkmanship, surprise attack, trusting and cheating can
usefully be viewed as either hot-headed or cool-headed activi-

30. Some less important rules of etiquette seem to reflect multiple equilibria.
For example, who goes first (women before men, age before beauty) is a convention
that is useful, but arbitrary. Since there are no strong efficiency impacts of one
versus another, they tend to vary over time and across societies.

ties. . . . [It is] asserted that the assumption of rational behavior is
a productive one in the generation of a systematic theory’’ [p. 16].
He makes the radical statement that ‘‘Hitler, the French
Parliament, . . . Khrushchev’’ can be modeled as behaving in a
maximizing way [p. 17]. In addition to pushing the notion that
maximizing behavior can be used to understand political interactions, Schelling puts forth a variety of ideas that show up later in
the game theory literature. Perhaps most important is Schelling’s
well-known point about there being strength in weakness. This
early version of pointing out that it is helpful to be able to commit
to a particular strategy has many applications in political economy.
For example, a country can prevent surprise attacks by publicizing the existence of a device that automatically launches full-scale
nuclear retaliation at the first sign of attack. A potential aggressor
who knows this would not benefit from attempting an early strike.
Issues of voting rules and constitutionality appeared early in
Arrow [1951b] who proved the well-known impossibility theorem
and Downs [1957], who modeled the median voter. Buchanan and
Tullock opened a large area of research by arguing that standard
economic tools could be used to understand political processes.
Individuals and groups act in their self-interest using the political
process to further their own goals. Buchanan and Tullock employ
economics to construct a general theory of constitutions, to discuss
the impact of majority rules, rules of unanimity, different legislative structures, and the optimal size of government.31 Their
approach has paramount in it questions of efficiency. When side
payments can eliminate an inefficient outcome, they ask whether
a political system will impede such side payments.
Rent-seeking activities that are socially unproductive, but
privately beneficial, are common in a system where some agents
can gain at the expense of others by a political system that favors
their goals. Theories of regulation and government capture,
presented by Stigler [1971], are extensions of the Buchanan and
Tullock approach to rational action in a political environment.
Modern political scientists use economic tools and gametheoretic constructs as well as the logic of maximization, efficiency, and equilibrium to analyze political situations. Much
builds on the work of Downs and the importance of the median
31. They argue that governments should be small for two reasons. First, this
allows for more competition between entities. Second, smaller jurisdictions can
cater more specifically to the interests of their residents. Only when externalities
are sufficiently large should the size of the governmental unit be expanded.

voter, but the main point is that the literature assumes a
self-motivated, rational, maximizing voter. John Ferejohn and
Morris Fiorina [1974], two distinguished political scientists, consider strategic interaction among agents and other decisions rules
to explain why a rational individual votes. Their approach is
economic. Costs and benefits are weighed. The controversy in this
literature is over what are the appropriate ways to treat uncertainty, not over whether the individual is a maximizer. Additionally, the analyses, of which this is an early example, use the
economist’s definition of equilibrium, usually in the sense of Nash.
The literature considers policies efficient which are defined as
those that benefit one group by more than others are penalized,
i.e., Pareto optimality. Some models have Congress playing a
game against a president who has the power of veto by presenting
him with a bill that he does not necessarily prefer, but one that he
likes better than the alternative of no bill at all. Here, as in
Schelling’s early work, the ability to commit to consider no other
bills after a veto strengthens the hand of Congress. Compensation
and incentive theory finds its way into the literature as well. For
example, Ferejohn [1986] models a representative’s behavior who
seeks the reward of votes. Voters cast their votes on the basis of
the representative’s performance, and the reward structure and
incentive analysis resemble the tournaments of personnel economics, where output is only imperfectly observed.
Economics has permeated international affairs. In Bueno de
Mesquita [1985] and Altfeld and Bueno de Mesquita [1979],
choices of sides and strategies in war are modeled as the outcome
of rational, maximizing behavior. Once again, equilibrium in the
economic sense is incorporated into the analysis. Not only are
theories developed, but the predictions are tested and confirmed
using the historical record.
Health Economics
Part of health economics can be viewed as an extension of the
theory of the firm. Education is one way to affect the quality of
labor. Investing in health is another. Accounting for about 15
percent of GDP, the health industry is an extremely important
part of our economy.
Most health issues do not revolve around improving the
quality of labor. Medicine is interesting to economists not only
because it is an important industry and not only because it affects
labor quality, but also because many people view health care as

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

inherently different from other goods or services. Early work by
Fuchs [1974] and Feldstein [1971] changed this view among
economists. Fuchs, in particular, had a significant effect on
academic physicians and those who study health administration.
Fuchs’s book made clear to those in the health industry that
trade-offs are as important in medicine as they are in any other
arena. Health care is an economic good, that is, a scarce resource
that cannot be provided to everyone. Part of what made this
palatable was that Fuchs cast much of the discussion in terms of
production trade-offs. For example, a hospital with limited resources must choose between another kidney dialysis machine
and some orthopedic device. In the absence of economic reasoning,
one might reason that the kidney machine is more essential
because it is life-saving, whereas the orthopedic device simply
makes life more pleasant for someone. Yet almost all hospitals
choose to have some of both, implicitly trading off a life-saving
device for one that may seem less important. Just as in diamondwater paradox, people value diamonds more highly on the margin
than they do water even though water is life-sustaining and
diamonds are mere ornaments. Economics makes clear the difference between the value of the first unit and of marginal units. At
some point, kidney dialysis machines are sufficiently abundant in
a particular hospital that it pays to spend marginal dollars on
orthopedic equipment because the additional kidney machine has
lower value than the first orthopedic device.
The implications are even more dramatic in other situations.
The decision to spend money on a heart-lung machine rather than
on equipment that makes possible chemotherapy for leukemia
patients might favor older individuals over children. Money spent
on breast cancer instead of prostate research favors women over
men. Money spent on health care over homeless shelters favors
the middle class over the poor. Such trade-offs, obvious and
natural to economists, were anathema to those in health care.
Economics plays a role in current thinking on incentives and
reimbursement. Much of this comes from the relatively new area
of personnel economics. Reimbursement systems that pay doctors
a fixed amount for a given illness (the diagnostic related group or
‘‘DRG’’ system) tend to encourage cost saving, but lower the
quality of treatment. Systems that reimburse for costs tend to
induce more than the optimal quality of care, with excessive
testing and treatment. There is nothing unique to medicine. This
is a direct application of standard contracting theory, where

distinctions are made between payment on input and payment on
output. When a builder is given a fixed-price contract, he wants to
cut corners and reduce quality. When he is paid on a cost-plus
basis, he tends to spend too much on the job and does not concern
himself enough with efficiency.
The impact of economics in this field, particularly the focus on
rational behavior, has been profound. The concept of opportunity
cost is now explicit in medical decisions. Many major medical
schools and schools of public health have economists on their
staffs. Economists publish in medical journals,32 and there is
widespread recognition that economics can be of assistance in
thinking about the allocation of resources, of pricing, and of
reimbursement algorithms.
Other Targets
One of the more unusual applications of economics derives
from Sherwin Rosen’s [1974] work on valuing attributes. Rosen
showed that nonmonetary attributes of a good, service, or job
could be valued by looking at market trade-offs. Rosen argued that
this idea could be used to estimate the value of a life. In Thaler
and Rosen [1976] the notion that workers are willing to give up
something to work in a less dangerous environment is used to
estimate the value that workers attach to their own lives. The
logic is that if a job that has no danger associated with it
whatsoever has a lifetime wage of say, $2,500,000, and one that
has a 1/100 probability of death pays a lifetime wage of $2,550,000,
then the marginal worker views a 1/100 chance of death as being
worth $50,000. If marginal utility equals average utility, then the
value of life would be estimated to be 100 times $50,000, or $5
million. Even under less stringent assumptions, lower (or upper)
bounds can be placed on the value of a life. The method has been
used in the medical literature to determine whether a particular
procedure is worthwhile (see Kessler and McClellan [1996]), in
determining whether a particular piece of military hardware is
cost effective, and in court cases involving damages in a loss of life
situation.
In another unusual application, economics has begun to
venture into linguistics. The jumping-off point is the notion that
language can be thought of as a standard (see, for example,
32. See, for example, Sicherman, Bombard, and Rappoport [1995] on when to
use amniocentesis testing.

Church and King [1993]). Like all standards, other things equal, it
is better if all conform to one standard. This idea has been used to
model cultural assimilation and the equilibrium distribution of
languages across a region (see Lazear [1999] and John and Yi
[1995]. In my own model, I argue that the main purpose of
language is to facilitate trade, broadly defined. Thus, the incentives to learn another language are greater when the language in
question is used by a large portion of the population. It is for this
reason that minorities are more likely to learn the majority
language than are majorities to learn the minority language. The
empirical findings are extremely strong. Using the 1900 and 1990
U. S. Federal Population Census, it is found that individuals who
live in ghettos with many others from their native land are much
less likely to be fluent in English than those who live in communities in which they are a smaller minority. The approach is then
used to examine the equilibrium that occurs in countries under a
variety of circumstances. Minority languages tend to disappear
over time. Countries made up of many equal-size minorities are
likely to adopt one language (often an outside one) as the
standard. Chauvinism, where a society forces immigrants and
minority members to learn the majority language, may be socially
optimal because the gains to the community as a whole in
increased trade swamp the costs borne by minority individuals.
Finally, ghettos are a natural outgrowth of the attempt to increase
trade by associating with those who share a language or culture
and need not result from constraints imposed by others.
The emphasis in this literature is on the three key economic
ingredients. Individuals learn language as a rational choice. They
do this taking into account the resulting equilibrium and that the
equilibrium reflects the actions of optimizing agents. Finally,
societies may attempt to impose rules, taxes, or subsidies to
eliminate inefficient outcomes in language choice and assimilation speed.

BARBARIANS

AT THE

GATE

It would not be fair to discuss economic imperialism without
also mentioning the effect that other fields, most notably and
recently psychology, have had on economics. This comes in two
forms. Because much of psychology is empirical, based on laboratory experiments where economic theories can be tested in a
controlled environment, findings by psychologists are sometimes

ECONOMIC IMPERIALISM

of interest or worse, a source of embarrassment to economists (see,
for example, the work of Tversky and Kahneman [1990]). There
have been two approaches to the anomalies to which outsiders call
our attention. The first is to incorporate them into economic
models. This approach, best exemplified by Akerlof ’s [1982] work,
which takes concepts from psychology and imbeds them in an
economic model.33 These models retain all of the essential ingredients of economic analysis. They continue to assume a maximizing
individual, albeit one with a perhaps unorthodox utility function.
They also maintain the central role of equilibrium in the analysis.
The approach is economic, but economics informed by psychology.
Another approach attributed to those who study behavioral
economics does not accept the economic framework. Rather,
results from other fields are used to tweak the noses of economists
for being so naive and using abstractions that do not fit the data.
Camerer et al. [1997] is an example of this type of analysis. Rather
than relying on maximizing behavior, equilibrium, and efficiency,
this work attempts to show that the standard models are at odds
with the data. They are often presented as puzzles.
Although puzzles and anomalies are useful because they
provoke thought, they are best thought of as starting points
rather than conclusions. Most economists who have done empirical research find that they encounter many puzzles along the way.
The goal of the scholar is to make sense of the data, to reconcile
the puzzles, and if completely successful, to bring them into a
general framework that allows predictions to be made. Success is
defined by enhanced understanding, not by increased confusion.
To the extent that the anomalous results lead to improved
analyses and better models, they are indeed worthwhile. This
does not imply that the economist should adopt the methodology
of other fields. It is the obsession with theories that are consistent,
rational, and unifying that gives economics its power.
An example of the difference between the way economists and
psychologists think about a problem is instructive. Psychologists
have been studying utility functions and trying to specify what
they actually look like. One case involves perceptions about living
in California. Despite the common perception that living in
California is pleasant, Schkade and Kahneman [1998] find that
Californians are no happier, as measured by their responses to a
33. See, for example, Akerlof [1982] and Akerlof and Dickens [1982] Thaler
and Sheffrin [1981] might also fit into this category.

particular survey, than are non-Californians. They view this as
being somewhat anomalous. Perhaps, but an economist would
think of this in a different way. Because we focus on equilibrium,
we would argue that the marginal person in Chicago can be no less
happy than the marginal person in California. Geographic sorting
on the basis of local characteristics is the essence of the point
made by Tiebout [1956]. Free mobility ensures that happiness is
equated for the marginal individual. If everyone had the same
tastes, then land prices or other attributes of the communities
would change such that in equilibrium, everyone would view the
communities as producing equal satisfaction. If tastes differ, then
the marginal individual is indifferent, and all others are happier
in their current location. Economic models try to make sense out
of nonsense. Sometimes, they abstract away from the essence of
the problem. But the better analyses provide insight where there
was confusion.
CONCLUSION
Economics has been successful because, above all, economics
is a science. The discipline emphasizes rational behavior, maximization, trade-offs, and substitution, and insists on models that
result in equilibrium. Economists are pushed to further inquiry
because they understand the concept of efficiency. Inefficient
equilibria beg for explanation and suggest that there may be gaps
in the underlying models that created them.
Because economics focuses so intently on maximization,
equilibrium, and efficiency, the field has derived many implications that are testable, refutable, and frequently supported by the
data. The goal of economic theory is to unify thought and to
provide a language that can be used to understand a variety of
social phenomena. The most successful economic imperialists
have used the theory to shed light on questions that lie far outside
those considered traditional. The fact that there have been so
many successful efforts in so many different directions attests to
the power of economics.
