DO BETTER SCHOOLS MATTER?

PARENTAL VALUATION OF ELEMENTARY EDUCATION*
SANDRA E. BLACK
The evaluation of numerous school reforms requires an understanding of the
value of better schools. Given the difficulty of calculating the relationship between
school quality and student outcomes, I turn to another method and use house
prices to infer the value parents place on school quality. I look within school
districts at houses located on attendance district boundaries; houses then differ
only by the elementary school the child attends. I thereby effectively remove the
variation in neighborhoods, taxes, and school spending. I find that parents are
willing to pay 2.5 percent more for a 5 percent increase in test scores. This finding
is robust to a number of sensitivity checks.

I. INTRODUCTION

Parents are not the only ones interested in the quality of
schools. Economists, educators, and policy makers, too, have long
been interested in the value of better schools in order to assess a
number of school reforms. Many studies of the effect of school
quality have tried to establish a direct causal link between such
inputs and outputs as test scores and earnings. Their inconclusive
results, however, have only served to fuel the great debate among
researchers (see Card and Krueger [1996], Betts [1995], and
Hanushek [1996]).

This debate has led studies to seek an alternative strategy,
one that focuses on estimating the value that parents place on
school quality by calculating how much more people pay for
houses located in areas with better schools. Although a wide range
of literature has examined this relationship, attempts to estimate
the causal effect of school quality on house prices have been
complicated by the fact that better schools tend to be located in
better neighborhoods. As a result, estimates that do not sufficiently control for neighborhood characteristics may overestimate
the value of better schools.

To avoid the problems faced by earlier studies, I compare
houses on opposite sides of attendance district boundaries-the

geographic lines that determine which school a child attends

within a school district. By looking within school districts in
Massachusetts, I can control for variation in property tax rates

and school spending. By limiting my sample to those houses that
are very close to the attendance district boundaries-houses
within close proximity to each other but whose children attend
different schools-I can also control for neighborhood differences.
Importantly, the fact that test scores make a discrete jump at
attendance district boundaries while neighborhoods continue to
change in a smooth manner allows me to isolate the relationship
between test scores and house prices.
My main finding reveals that a 5 percent increase in elementary school test scores (approximately one standard deviation)
leads to an increase in the marginal resident's willingness to pay
of approximately 2.1 percent, or $3948 at the mean house price of
$188,000. This amount is roughly half the estimate one obtains
with more typical hedonic housing price regressions. Moreover, an
important aspect of this finding is its robustness to a number of
sensitivity checks and tests of omitted variable bias.
The results add to the existing literature by providing
information on how much parents value schools with higher test
scores, information that aids in the evaluation of various educational policies. In addition, this paper underlines the importance
of better schools not only to parents, but to home owners and local
politicians as well: its results indicate that a one-point increase in
Massachusetts standardized test scores (less than one standard
deviation) could lead to an increase in house values of close to $70
million in the state.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section II offers the
basic methodology; Section III discusses the data; and Section IV
presents the results and specification checks. Section V concludes
and poses some further implications of my findings.

II. BASIC METHODOLOGY

The standard hedonic estimation involves an inelastic supply
of housing with many types of consumers whose tastes for
characteristics differ. In equilibrium, all consumers with identical
preferences and income can achieve the same level of satisfaction;
price compensates for greater amenities. A hedonic price function

describes the equilibrium, where the sales price is described as a
function of the characteristics of the house and its location, and

the price that is associated with each characteristic represents
that of the marginal purchaser.1 The basic relationship of interest
is as follows:

(1) In (pricejiaj) = ?+ X+ia +jI + ?+ Ytestaj + Eiaj,
where Piaj is the price of house i in attendance district a in school
district j. The vector Xiaj includes characteristics of house i such

as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms in the house, Zj is a

vector of neighborhood and school district characteristics. The

regressor of primary interest, testajy is the average test score in
school that children living in attendance district a in school
district j would attend.

Previous research on the relationship between house prices
and school quality has estimated versions of equation (1).2 Unfortunately, a drawback to these approaches is that all relevant
house or neighborhood characteristics cannot be observed; hence,
results are biased because of omitted variables. There are two
distinct types of omitted variable problems with this estimation.
First, there are omitted variables that vary at the school district
level, in particular property tax rates and public goods provision.
Second, there are omitted variables that can change over space,
both within and across school districts, such as neighborhood
characteristics. To eliminate such problems, the methodology

explored here replaces the vector of observed characteristics

with a full set of boundary dummies that indicate houses that
share (on either side) an attendance district boundary:

(2) In (priceiab) =a + X'iabP3 + K'(4 + ytesta + Eiab,
where Kb is a vector of boundary dummies. Conceptually, this
methodology is equivalent to calculating differences in mean
house prices on opposite sides of attendance district boundaries
1. By using this price as a measure of the value, I am getting a lower bound on
the average value of test scores, since sorting suggests that those who value it
more will be living in the better attendance district.
2. For early work see Kain and Quigley [1975] and Li and Brown [1980]. More
recent work has focused on smaller areas, including Hayes and Taylor [1996],

Downes and Zabel [1997], and Bogart and Cromwell [1997]. However, it is not clear

that these areas are small enough to effectively remove differences in neighborhoods.

Other related work includes that by Bradbury, Case, and Mayer [1998], who
look at the capitalization of school quality and taxes by estimating the relationship
between changes in house prices and changes in school quality and taxes. As noted,
my study eliminates the variation in tax rates by looking within school districts.

(controlling for house characteristics) and relating this to differences in test scores.3 Boundary dummies account for any unobserved characteristics shared by houses on either side of the
boundary.
This methodology helps us address both types of omitted

variable problems. In the first case, because the houses being
compared are in the same city, factors that vary at the school
district or city level, such as differences in school spending and in
property tax rates, are no longer a concern. (Note that because I

am controlling for variation in school spending at the district
level, the differences in test scores across boundaries reflect
differences in the less observable components of school quality,

which could include better peers, better teachers or administrators, or more involved parents at the school.) In the second case, if
neighborhoods change continuously over space, by looking at
houses very close to attendance district boundaries-where there
is a discrete change in school quality-I can avoid the pitfalls
associated with omitted neighborhood characteristics.4

III. DATA AND SUMMARY STATISTICS
The housing price data cover all purchases and sales from

1993 through 1995 for Middlesex, Essex, and Norfolk counties in

Massachusetts, all suburbs of Boston.5 I chose Massachusetts as
my study sample because its school districts are small, which
leads to a relative homogeneity of populations within districts. I

focus on elementary schools because only these schools allow for
enough within-district variation.
Figure I presents an example of a city in my sample; the thick

black lines represent the attendance district boundaries, while

3. See the Data Appendix for more detailed information on attendance
district boundaries.
4. This methodology applies a regression discontinuity approach most recently used by Angrist and Lavy [1999] and Van der Klaauw [1997]. Bogart and
Cromwell [1997] apply a similar approach by looking at houses on either side of
school district boundaries in an area where there is no variation in public services
at these boundaries. However, they do not attribute the differences in prices to any

school attributes (such as test scores or differences in spending); moreover, their

estimates may still be biased by omitted neighborhood characteristics.
5. These three counties accounted for 43.4 percent of total school enrollments
in Massachusetts in the 1995-1996 school year, with the following breakdown:
Middlesex 21.4 percent, Essex 11.9 percent, and Norfolk 10.1 percent. There are a
total of fourteen counties in Massachusetts [Market Data Retrieval 1996]. Housing
price data were obtained from Bankers and Tradesman, a data products group.

the thin black lines represent streets within the city.6 Houses were
assigned to attendance district boundaries based on proximity; a

house was assigned to the nearest boundary, regardless of distance. Each house is associated with only one boundary. Houses

were also matched to census block groups.7 Figure II shows the
attendance districts (thick black lines) and the census block
groups (thin black lines) for this city. Note that census block
groups are not coincident with attendance district boundaries.

Using census block group identification, I matched the houses to

the 1990 census data. Houses were also matched to school-districtlevel data such as per-pupil expenditures, pupil/teacher ratios,
and property taxes.

This study was limited to single-family residences for reasons
of comparability.8 For a school district to be included in the
sample, it must have at least two elementary schools that overlap
grades. There were also four school districts with intradistrict

districts themselves.

census data are collected (each block group has an average of 1400 people).
8. Some transactions have missing "type of residence" data, which leaves me
unable to determine single-family residences. I have excluded these observations
from the sample. In some cases, entire city-year cells are excluded.

choice programs, which allow parents to choose which school

within the district their child attends.9 Because school assignment is not based on location, housing prices will not pick up
differences in school quality; therefore, these school districts were
excluded from the sample. In addition, there were 24 school

districts whose attendance district boundaries were either poorly
defined or not available. The resulting sample covers 39 school
districts.

Because of concerns about neighborhood differences on opposite sides of an attendance district boundary, I was careful to omit
boundaries from my sample if the two attendance districts were

divided in ways that seemed to clearly divide neighborhoods;
attendance districts divided by large rivers, parks, golf courses, or
any large stretch of land were excluded.

Summary Statistics
The full sample consists of 22,679 single-family residences
within 39 school districts that have at least two elementary
schools that overlap grades and no system of intradistrict school
choice. There are 181 attendance district boundaries in the
9. These districts are Cambridge, Somerville, Lowell, and Lawrence.

sample. Table I summarizes the data. The mean house price in my
sample is $188,076 with a standard deviation of $113,923. The
median house price is $157,931.10
My proxy for school quality is the fourth grade Massachusetts
Educational Assessment Program (MEAP), a statewide assess-

ment performed every two years on students in grades 4, 8, and
12. Its purpose is both to furnish information to improve curriculum and instruction in Massachusetts schools and to provide

reliable results for comparison at the school, district, and state
levels. In addition to being comparable across schools, evidence
suggests that test scores such as these may be important indicators of school quality. There is some evidence that relates elemen-

tary school test scores to outcomes later in life such as wages and
employment (see Currie and Thomas [1998]); in addition, the
popular literature suggests that parents do use test scores as a
primary measure of school quality.11 Even if parents are not
considering test scores specifically when evaluating a school but
are instead looking at characteristics that are correlated with test

scores, test scores will still be an appropriate measure.12
The MEAP test consists of five parts: reading, science, social
studies, mathematics, and writing.13 I use test scores for 1988,
1990, and 1992, and focus primarily on the sum of the math and
reading scores, averaged over the three years.14 Each section is
scored out of 16.00, and the scoring is relative at the state level,
with the best school receiving a 16.00. The means of the math,
reading, science, and social studies scores averaged over the three
years are 13.8, 13.8, 13.7, and 13.7, with standard deviations of

10. In regressions where the house price in dollars is the dependent variable,
prices are deflated to 1993 dollars using the median house price in Boston for the
quarter [Source: National Association of Realtors Home Sales, various years]. In
addition, all house prices are adjusted to incorporate the future stream of property
tax payments, assuming that property taxes remain constant and the discount
rate is 6 percent for an infinite lifetime. Results are entirely insensitive to this
adjustment.
11. See The Elementary School Handbook [Oppenheim 1989], p. 21.
12. See Hoxby [1998] for more discussion of what parents consider when
choosing a school.

13. In some cases, school scores are unreported due to small school and class
size (a school with fewer than twenty students in the fourth grade does not report
its scores) or because the school opened recently (and hence has no previous test
scores). In the case of new schools, excluding these boundaries because of omitted
test scores is not problematic, as the recent opening of a new school undoubtedly
resulted in a change in the attendance district boundaries within the school
district. It is unclear how the exclusion of small schools will affect the results.
14. Other work uses either the math, the reading, or the sum of the two as
indicators of school quality. See Bradbury, Case, and Mayer [1998] for one
example.

.77, .68, .63, and .65, respectively. The mean value of the average
of the sum of the reading and math over the three years is 27.59. I
also test the sensitivity of the results to my choice of the sum of the
reading and math scores averaged over the three years as the
indicator of school quality.

I use a number of census block group variables to represent

neighborhood characteristics (see Table I). At the neighborhood
level, the mean age distribution is 12 percent children aged less

than 10 years and 14 percent adults 65 years or older. There are
an average of 1.5 percent of households that are female headed
with children, while approximately 1.5 percent are Hispanic and
fewer than 1 percent are non-Hispanic black. Fifteen percent of
adults over the age of 25 have a bachelor's degree, 10 percent have
a graduate degree, and 8 percent do not have a high school
diploma. This sample is unique in that it contains a disproportionate number of relatively wealthy Boston suburbs. All of these
variables are measured at the census block group level and not at
the individual house level.
I also add a number of school district characteristics mea-

sured for all schools in the district. The average pupil/teacher
ratio is 15.02, which is approximately the state average. About

half of the districts have a free- or reduced-cost preschool program. The average per-pupil expenditure in 1993 was $4440.
Property tax rates are also measured at the school district level (in
my sample, the city and school district are synonymous). The
average property tax is $13.60 per $1000 of assessed house value.
I use these measures to proxy for financial inputs into schools,
most of which occurs at the school district level.

IV. RESULTS

Table II, column (1), presents the results when I estimate
equation (1). I do so to calculate the valuation of better schools one

would get if one did not limit the comparison to houses on opposite
sides of an attendance district boundary. The regression includes

house level characteristics-including the number of bedrooms,
bathrooms, lot size, internal square footage, and age of the
building-and neighborhood characteristics, proxied by census
block group level data from the 1990 census that includes the
percentages of Hispanics; non-Hispanic blacks; female-headed
households with related children; people 25 or over with a
bachelor's degree, a graduate degree, and who never finished high

school; and the age distribution (divided into 0-9 years, 65 and
older, and all others). I also include the distance of the house from
Boston and the distance squared to proxy commuting time.15 The
regression also includes school quality characteristics such as
per-pupil expenditures in 1993, the pupil/teacher ratio, and the
existence of free or reduced-cost preschool programs, all measured
at the school district level, along with property tax rates (also at
the district level), and the sum of the reading and math MEAP
test scores for the elementary school averaged over 1988, 1990,
and 1992 16

The results (presented in column (1) of Table II and column 1
of Appendix 1) are consistent with previous work done on housing

prices.17 Bedrooms and bathrooms are positively correlated with
higher house prices, as is lot size and the square footage of the
house. The number of bathrooms is nonlinear. The age of the

building and the distance from the center city are both negatively
related to the house price, also in nonlinear fashions.
School characteristics also enter the equation in the manner
one would expect. Per-pupil spending is positively correlated with
house prices, and the coefficient suggests that a $500 increase in

per-pupil expenditures leads to a 2.2 percent increase in the house

price ($4136 at the mean of $188,000). A higher pupil/teacher ratio
is associated with a lower house price, while higher test scores are
associated with a higher house price. The magnitude of the test

scores coefficient indicates that a 5 percent increase in the average
elementary school test score is associated with a 4.9 percent
increase in the house price, an increase equivalent to $9280 at the
mean.

These results are not surprising. But the serious problem of

unobserved or unmeasured neighborhood characteristics remains.

Because of the problems associated with equation (1), I focus
my attention on equation (2), which includes boundary fixed
effects. When estimating equation (2), I systematically restrict my

sample to houses that are smaller and smaller distances from the

attendance district boundary. As the sample is restricted to
houses closer and closer to the boundary, it becomes less likely

that there are differences other than the elementary school
quality on opposite sides of the boundary.
I initially estimate equation (2) for the sample of houses
located within 0.35 miles from the nearest boundary, arguing that

the houses on opposite sides of the boundary but within one-third
of a mile are similar in all respects except the elementary school
the child attends. These results are presented in Table II, column
(2). One can see that the coefficient on elementary school test

scores is approximately half of the coefficient initially estimated
using the more typical hedonic housing price regression.18 As a
check of the assumption that there are no significant neighborhood differences being picked up in my test scores coefficient, I
restrict my sample even further. Columns (3) and (4) show the

estimates as the sample is restricted to only houses very close to
the boundary, with the distances at 0.20 miles and 0.15 miles from
the boundary.19 In both cases, the coefficients on house characteristics and test scores do not change significantly.

Column (5) of Table II shows that it is not the change in the
sample size that is driving the results. This column shows that
when the aggregate hedonic house price regression (without
boundary fixed effects) is run on the subsample of houses that are
located within 0.15 miles from a boundary, the coefficient on the

elementary school test scores does not differ from the results from

the larger sample.20
Table III shows how the houses on opposite sides of the

boundary become more similar as the sample is reduced to houses
that are closer and closer to the boundary. The ratios represent
the difference in means of houses on opposite sides of the
boundary for the restricted sample over the difference in means

for the whole sample. As expected, the number is generally
decreasing, indicating that, by looking closer to the boundary, I
compare houses that are more similar in both physical attributes
and neighborhood characteristics.
The first row shows the simple difference in means of house

prices on opposite sides of the boundary, which provides a rough,
18. The difference between the coefficients is statistically significant at the 5
percent level.
19. Houses located exactly on the boundary were dropped due to the
imprecision of the mapping software. Results are not sensitive to this exclusion.
20. I also estimated equations (1) and (2) with the level of the house price as
the dependent variable; the results were substantively the same.

nonparametric estimate of the value of better schools. Because

this number is strictly comparing means on opposite sides of
attendance district boundaries and not associating it with differences in test scores, the number is larger than that which is

estimated in Table II, columns (2)-(4). In addition, there are no

controls for house characteristics such as the number of bedrooms
or bathrooms.21

To better understand what these results suggest, we turn to
Table IV, which compares the magnitude of the results of various

specifications presented in Table II. The variable of interest is the
elementary school test score. We can see that the coefficient on the
elementary school test scores is significantly positive in all cases.
When looking at the regression where the houses are only 0.15

miles from the boundary (column (4)), note that the coefficient

suggests that a 5 percent increase in test scores (approximately
one standard deviation) is associated with a 2.1 percent increase
in housing prices, or an increase of approximately $3948 at the
mean (the mean house price is $1&8,000). From another perspective, this suggests that a move from a school that scores in the
twenty-fifth percentile of my sample to a school in the seventyfifth percentile of my sample would result in a house price
increase of 2.9 percent, or $5452 at the mean. This amount is
roughly half the estimated effect if one runs a simple hedonic
housing price regression, which is presented in column (1). This
finding suggests that, if one does not carefully control for neighborhood characteristics, one will greatly overestimate the value of the
additional school quality as measured by test scores.
Sensitivity Tests

To test the results' sensitivity, I run a number of specification

tests.22 One concern with this estimation is that the areas being
compared, on opposite sides of attendance district boundaries, are
not really the same neighborhoods. I test this concern in a number
21. Note that this number differs from that in Table V, column (2), due to the
exclusion of controls for the age of house. This is the one variable that is
significantly different on opposite sides of the attendance district boundaries and
the omission of it as a control variable leads to an upward bias on the estimate of
the coefficient on test scores.

22. -Because there is no substantive difference in the results between the 0.35
mile restricted sample, the 0.20 mile restricted sample, and the 0.15 mile
restricted sample, I use the 0.35 mile restricted sample in future regressions to
increase precision (without imposing any more significant identifying restric-

tions).

school attendance district but that span the same distance.23

Table V, column (2), gives the results of the true treatment
estimation; using houses within 0.20 miles of the boundary, I
regress the log house price on boundary dummies, house charac-

teristics, and a "hi" dummy indicating if the house is on the

"better" side of the boundary (as determined by the average test
scores). Table V, column (3), presents the results from the regres-

sion that uses the artificial "control" group (the sample that was
contained entirely within the attendance district and did not cross
any boundaries) and regresses the log house price on the same
controls, the only difference being that the "control" regression
had the artificial dummy for being on the "better" side. If the
results are not picking up differences in schools, but instead

reflect the progression of neighborhoods, one would expect the

same results for houses that do not cross the boundaries of
attendance districts but span the same distance. As expected, the
"hi" dummy in the true regression (where houses are on opposite

sides of the boundary) has a significant and positive coefficient,
while the coefficient on the control "hi" is zero and insignificant.
As another check, I include neighborhood characteristics such
as the racial and age distribution at the census block group level
in the regression. As one can see in column (4) of Table V, the

coefficient on test scores does not change significantly. These
results suggest that the results are not just picking up a natural

progression in neighborhoods.24
Finally, one might be concerned that the results reflect

unobservable differences in house quality. If people who are more

concerned about schools also take better care of their houses, then

23. For my control group, I take houses that are between 0.4 and 0.8 miles
from the boundary within the same attendance district. I assume that better
schools are associated with better neighborhoods, so for the houses in the
attendance district of the "better" school (that is, the one with higher test scores),
the houses farther from the boundary (those between 0.6 and 0.8 miles from the
boundary) are deemed the "better" control group. For the houses in the attendance
district of the "worse"' school (the one with the lower test scores), the houses closer
to the boundary are deemed the "better" group (because I assume that this "bad"
relative neighborhood is only getting worse, just as the "good" relative neighborhood is only getting better), so any house between 0.4 and 0.6 miles from the
boundary is the "better" control group.
24. It is interesting to note, however, that the coefficient on the test score
variable does become less precisely estimated, which may suggest that what the
test score variable is picking up is in part the value of having better students and
parents at the school. However, it is not clear that one would want to include
neighborhood controls. For example, if the benefit of having better educated
neighbors comes through having better children at the school, then including the
education level of one's neighborhoods would pick up some of the valuation that
should be attributed to having a better school.

the results might in fact be picking up in part the value of the

"better cared for" houses. (One could, however, make the equally
likely argument that people who care a lot about schools given a

particular budget constraint are willing to settle with "less cared
for" homes in order to get the better schools, which would work in
the opposite direction.) I test this first by looking at how observ-

able characteristics differ across boundary lines. A subsample of
these results are presented in Table V, columns (5) and (6), where
house square footage and lot size are regressed on the elementary

school test score and the boundary dummies. The results show no
significant difference between houses on opposite sides of the
boundary with respect to these observable characteristics. If
observable characteristics (such as the number of bedrooms,
bathrooms, lot size, and internal square footage) do not vary
significantly on opposite sides of the boundaries, this may suggest
that unobservables are also relatively unchanging.25
A final check involves comparing the results for one- and
two-bedroom houses with the results for three- or more bedroom
houses. If all families with children lived in houses with three or
more bedrooms and all individuals without children lived in oneand two-bedroom houses, and if the stock of houses were fixed,
there would be no price effect of better schools for one- and
two-bedroom homes. Although this separation does not always
hold true, people in houses with three or more bedrooms should be

willing to pay more for better schools than people in one- and
two-bedroom houses since they are more likely to have children. I

estimate equation (2), but instead of using the test score, I include
the interaction of the test score and a dummy indicating whether
it is a one- or two-bedroom house and the interaction of the test
score and a dummy indicating whether it is a three- or more

bedroom house. These results are presented in Table V, column
(7). The coefficient on test scores interacted with the three- or
more bedroom dummy is still statistically significant and is a bit

higher (.017), while the coefficient on the interaction of one- and
two-bedroom houses and test scores is much smaller (.006) and

statistically insignificant. This finding reinforces the idea that the
results are due to the differences in elementary schools and not

just to unobserved differences in the quality of the houses.

25. As one can see in Table III, the age of the house is the only house
characteristic that differs significantly on opposite sides of attendance district

boundaries.

DO BETTER SCHOOLS MATTER? 595

V. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS

Do parents value school quality? Indeed they do. Using an

approach that compares houses that are close to each other but
are associated with different elementary schools, I find that
parents do care about school peers and other unmeasured components of school quality. As such, they are willing to pay about 2.1
percent-or $3948-more for houses associated with test scores
that are 5 percent higher at the mean. My findings also suggest
that a move from a school that scores in the twenty-fifth percentile
of my sample to a school in the seventy-fifth percentile would
result in a house price increase of $5452. These results are robust
to different tests of specification and omitted variable biases.
These findings have several key implications. For example,
although the preferences of my sample of suburban Boston home
owners do not necessarily reflect the preferences of others, the
approach could help us to evaluate more effectively a number of

education policies. One such policy is the Metco program, which
promotes desegregation and enables urban students in Boston to
achieve academically by enrolling them in participating suburban
school districts. By applying this approach to the affected population of low-income households, we could estimate the financial
benefit to the parents of these children.26
My results also provide a perspective on the value of better
schools, not only to parents but also to home owners and politicians. For instance, a one-point rise in average reading and math
scores in Massachusetts that is less than a one-standarddeviation increase (and a bit more than the change in scores in the
last ten years) could lead to a 1.5 percent increase in housing
prices. Given that there were 36,610 houses in the state in 1985
and the median sales price was $126,000, this rise in scores

suggests a $69,192,900 jump in overall wealth in Massachusetts.27
In short, parents' willingness to pay more for better schools,
as measured by test scores, is found to be capitalized in house
prices. Although we still do not know what causes the differences
in scores-whether it is better peers, superior teachers, more
involved parents, or more effective administrators-an under-

26. Note that this type of program evaluation assumes a nonlinear treatment
in that the urban student would benefit from the suburban school but the addition
of one urban student would not have a negative effect on the other students.
27. Note that this type of evaluation requires various assumptions such as

the value of test scores for the marginal and average home owners are equal and

the sample is representative of the population of the state.

standing of the value of higher test scores leads us one step closer
to determining the benefits of various educational policies.
DATA APPENDIX: ATTENDANCE DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
An important feature of attendance district boundaries that
make them useful for this estimation is that they are unchanging.
School district administrators attest to this constancy. One administrator noted, "Boundaries are not changed very often, and when

they are it is for some large reason such as the closing or opening
of a school. Sometimes new [housing] developments may cause
this to happen. Changing boundaries is a sensitive issue to
everyone." The process typically involves identifying where all the
children are by grade level and street, and then identifying a
variety of options for boundaries. The district then holds public
hearings and tries to respond to the concerns of parents. Finally,
the school district makes the decision. Administrators emphasize
that this is a very sensitive issue to home owners and requires
many discussions with parents.28

According to school district administrators, when attendance
districts were first determined, the primary factors considered
were the size of the school and the distribution of students by
grade level. They also considered racial balance, natural boundaries (rivers or a highway), and in some cases family economics
and neighborhoods. [Boundaries that are considered natural
boundaries (such as rivers and parks) are excluded from my
sample.] An administrator from the North Reading school district
stated "this [family economics] is probably the least of the factors,
but in some instances, it is a consideration. We try not to have one
school with all the advantaged or disadvantaged children."
Note that, while most boundaries determine elementary
school attendance alone, there are a few boundaries that also
represent the boundaries that determine middle school attendance. In this case, I estimate the value of both the elementary
and the middle school. However, this discrepancy occurs only in a
limited number of districts; in general, there is only one middle
28. Anecdotal evidence also corroborates the idea that the boundaries, once
drawn, are not readily changed. According to an article from USA Today [May

1996], "Jay Broder, vice president of a manufacturing company in Louisville,

helped defeat a school board plan in February that would have shifted his
second-grade daughter out of the popular Centerfield Elementary School where 63
percent of fourth-graders tested proficient in reading versus 32 percent at nearby
Crestwood Elementary. A change also would have jeopardized the $60,000
appreciation he's enjoyed over nine years of [home] ownership, he says."

DO BETTER SCHOOLS MATTER? 597

school or the boundaries for the middle schools are different, so
this is not a concern.

While the attendance district boundaries are unchanging in

most school districts, the structure of some of the Massachusetts
school districts has undergone significant changes over the past
ten years. Most notable is the availability of intradistrict or
interdistrict school choice in some school districts. Interdistrict
choice gives parents living outside of a choice district the opportunity to send their child to a school within the choice district,

thereby enabling the child to attend a school outside of his own
district. Intradistrict choice gives parents the choice to send their
child to any school within the school district.
The availability of interdistrict school choice began with the
1991-1992 school year in Massachusetts and now exists in 87
districts across the state. This allows parents more choice regarding which school their child will attend (because they now have
not only their geographically determined school within the dis-

trict, but also the option to send their child outside the district if
the outside district has a school choice program). As a result, my
results may underestimate the true value of schools and school
peers because parents may not be willing to pay as much for their
within-district school if they also have the option of outsidedistrict schools. However, because this program is not large, the

availability of interdistrict choice most likely will have little or no
effect on these results.
School districts with intradistrict choice (where school atten-

dance is not based on geography) are excluded from the sample.
There are, however, school districts that have a system of limited

choice, where geography is the primary determinant of school
attendance but parents may choose to put their child on a waiting
list for another school. Admittance to the other school is based on

space availability, and often these children will not be provided
with transportation by the school district.29 Because this is not a
formal intradistrict choice program, the school districts are not
omitted from the sample. Their inclusion may lead to a downward

bias of my estimate. Also, if one believes that the implementation
of school choice within a district is positively correlated with
parental concern and parental valuation of school quality and
29. Note that admittance is almost always at the discretion of district

administrators, and children are most frequently allowed to move for a pedagogical reason or to improve the racial balance. These transfers are therefore not
generally available but are person-specific.

peer effects, by excluding districts with school choice I will once
again be underestimating the value of school quality. (The existence of districts with intradistrict choice provides an interesting

opportunity to study the effects of the implementation of school
choice. I leave this for future work.)
