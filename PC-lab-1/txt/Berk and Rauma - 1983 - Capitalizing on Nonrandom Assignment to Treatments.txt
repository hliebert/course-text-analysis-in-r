we apply a regression-discontinuity analysis, made possible by an ongoing crime control program that inadvertently conforms to a regression-discontinuity design.

1. INTRODUCTION
The formal properties of randomized experiments are
well known and, at least on grounds of internal validity,
randomized experiments have been advocated as the

most effective way to evaluate the impact of social interventions (Campbell and Stanley 1963; Reicken and Bo-

We evaluate the impact of legislation in California that
extends eligibility for unemployment benefits to individuals who, because of a prison sentence, would ordinarily
be unable to obtain unemployment payments. The basic
question is whether ex-offenders who receive such benefits have lower reincarceration rates than ex-offenders
who do not receive such benefits.
In the next section, we briefly summarize the legislation and the program that resulted. Then, we turn to a
short discussion of the formal properties of regressiondiscontinuity procedures, drawing heavily on several recent papers. Finally, after describing the data, we present
the results of the evaluation and draw some general conclusions about the effectiveness of the research strategy
employed.

ruch 1974; Cook and Campbell 1979). There are now

many examples of successful evaluation studies based on
random assignment to experimental and control groups
(Boruch et al. 1978), demonstrating that true experiments

are both feasible and instructive. However, social program evaluations include far more than impact assess-

ment, especially if the goal is to provide useful infor-

mation to policy makers corresponding to the
evolutionary stage of the social policy in question (Cronbach et al. 1980; Rossi and Berk 1981). Moreover, there
are often situations in which random assignment is not

possible. Alternatives to the true experiment should
therefore be available.

If one's primary motive is to rule out competing ex-

rarely more than loose change, and few ex-prisoners qualify for the range of transfer payments available to many
other citizens (e.g., Aid to Families with Dependent Children). Prospects for employment are equally discouraging since most ex-offenders have unattractive work histories, few marketable skills, and the stigma of a criminal
record. Therefore, it is not surprising that many return
to crime, perhaps as an alternative or as a supplement
to a legitimate job (Becker 1968; Ehrlich 1973; Block

and Heineke 1975; Rossi, Berk, and Lenihan 1980; Berk,
Lenihan, and Rossi 1980).

A number of efforts have been made to design social
programs that improve the economic prospects of ex-offenders, but to date the evaluations have been mixed

(Rossi, Berk, and Lenihan 1980, pp. 21-46). The most
promising results apparently come from programs that

shortly after release provide modest payments to ex-prisoners who are unable to find work (Mallar and Thornton
1978; Berk, Lenihan, and Rossi 1980). Much like unemployment benefits available to other citizens, such
payments are supposed to carry recipients through a brief
period of financial hardship until employment can be
found.

As described elsewhere in more detail (Berk and
Rauma 1981), California Senate Bill 224 rested heavily

on the "transitional aid" philosophy. Beginning in July
1978, unemployment insurance in California was extended to cover ex-offenders who had been incarcerated
in any of the state prisons. Prisoners could obtain eligibility by working at prison jobs or by participating in
prison vocational training programs. For these assignments, prisoners were assumed to be earning $2.30 an
hour, then the minimum wage (although they were actually being paid at a rate of about 20 cents an hour), and
at least $1,500 (i.e., 652 hours at $2.30 per hour) earned
over a 12 month period was needed to qualify for the
program. Upon release, ex-offenders who could not find
jobs and who had accumulated sufficient earnings in
prison could apply at their local unemployment office,
much like any other citizen. The amount of support available depended .on the hours worked in prison, with the
effective range of benefits between $30 and $70 a week
for up to 26 weeks. Except for the eligibility criteria, the
usual unemployment regulations applied.
By most standards, the Former Inmate unemployment
insurance program was an innovative effort. Equally unusual were legislative provisions requiring an evaluation
of the program's impact. In particular, there was enormous interest in whether individuals who received the
unemployment payments were less likely to run afoul of
the law, and, in these terms, whether the program was
cost-effective. Indeed, Senate Bill 224 was written as
"sundown legislation" with a five-year lifespan. Any attempts to resurrect the program would presumably have
to address the evaluation findings.

3. A BRIEF SUMMARY OF REGRESSIONDISCONTINUITY PROCEDURES
The history of regression-discontinuity procedures is
at least 20 years old. Despite some technical errors that
unnecessarily limited its applicability, Campbell and
Stanley (1963) perhaps first introduced regression-discontinuity procedures to the evaluation research community. More recently, the formal properties of regression-discontinuity techniques have been explored by
Goldberger (1972a,b), Barnow (1972), Rubin (1977,1978),
and Trochim and Spiegelman (1980).
First, subjects are assigned to treatment and control
groups on the basis of a variable such as income, reading
scores, age, or hours of prison employment. Subjects who
fall on or below some distinct cutoff point are placed in
the experimental group, while those above that point are
placed in the control group (or vice versa). Thus, assignment occurs through a known and measured decision rule
that is presumably not subject to error of any kind. Considered within a broader and Bayesian framework, the
"assignment mechanism" is a known function of variables whose values have been recorded, which defines the
assignment mechanism as "ignorable" (Rubin 1978, p.
42). There are, for instance, no unobservable assignment
variables (cf. Heckman 1979; Spiegelman 1979) making
the assignment mechanism "nonignorable."
Second, if the assignment mechanism to experimental
and control groups is known and measured, it is possible
to isolate treatment effects by conditioning one's analysis
on the assignment variable; unbiased estimates of treatment effects may be obtained (Rubin 1977). In practice,
it is common to apply an analysis of covariance that includes the assignment variable as a regressor and that
will, under certain conditions (described below), make a
treatment dummy variable orthogonal to all potentially
confounding exogenous influences. In other words, unbiased estimates of treatment effects are obtained by estimating the following equation:

Yi = ,Bo + ,BlXi + ,B2Ti + Ui ' (1)

where Yi is the outcome variable, Xi is the assign
variable, Ti is a treatment dummy variable equal
members of the experimental group and equal to 0 for

members of the control group, and Ui is a stochastic disturbance meeting the usual assumptions of ordinary least

squares. The treatment is captured by P2, assuming that

Ti = 1 if Xi ? C
= 0if Xi <C (2)

as comparable as possible to the traditional regressiondiscontinuity formulation, we settled on hours and the
square of hours to model the nonlinear relationship.
Since we had a maximum of 12 months of follow-up
data from the date of release, the length of the follow-up
period after ex-offenders applied for the program was
necessarily less than 12 months. In order to standarize

Table 1 shows some selected descriptive statistics for

released from state prison. The sample also appears quite

(Mallar and Thornton 1978; Rossi, Berk, and Lenihan
1980). Finally, Table 2 indicates that, at least with respect

10-month interval were dropped from the analysis. We

lost 106 subjects in this manner, which raised the pos-

sibility of "incidental" sample selection bias (Goldberger
1981). Heckman's (1979) well-known procedures were,
therefore, applied. Sixteen additional subjects were
dropped from the sample because they committed some
offense before applying for benefits (apparently they had
not yet returned to prison) and, therefore, were considered outside the definition of the program.
To briefly summarize, the basic question to be an-

swered is whether those individuals who applied for and

to variables that were readily available, our full sample
of parolees looks quite similar to the population from
which it was drawn. The population and the sample are
virtually identical with respect to race, age, the number
of prior prison sentences, the number of parole terms

(including the current one), and the proportion of opiate
users. The program applicants do not seem to be especially good risks or bad risks compared with the usual
California parolee.

mated probit equation, a hazard rate for each case is constructed. Finally, the hazard rate is included as a new
regressor in the original substantive equation of interest
(i.e., equation (3)).
The correction left the story virtually unchanged. The
causal effect increased to slightly less than 14 percent
while the t value increased to 1.54 in absolute value.
These modest changes were hardly unexpected given that

mates of the treatment effect and other coefficient esti-

only 9 percent of the cases were dropped (i.e., there was
not much selection going on). The coefficient associated
with the hazard rate regressor implied that the excluded
cases had a lower probability of recidivism.
We also considered whether the treatment effect could
be found within a survival-time framework, including corrections for the censoring implicit in the finite follow-up

mates, and it was possible by varying the specification

to obtain treatment effects that were reductions ranging
between 5 and 15 percent.

6. CONCLUSIONS
Although to our knowledge there has never before been
a large-scale criminal justice evaluation using a regres-

sion-discontinuity analysis, our experience suggests that
such procedures are both useful and feasible, especially
when random assignment cannot be undertaken. Perhaps
the major obstacle is an inability to put to a proper em-

pirical test the functional relationship between the assignment variable and the outcome.
The substantive conclusions are also straightforward.

long delay has at least two implications: individuals who

"lost" before they can apply or before the program can

be delivered, and individuals who have a strong inclination and ability to find legitimate employment will not

apply. In one sense, an unknown number of bad risks and
