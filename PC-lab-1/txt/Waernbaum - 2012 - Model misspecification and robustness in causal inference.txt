Model misspecification and robustness in
causal inference: comparing matching
with doubly robust estimation
Ingeborg Waernbaum* †
In this paper, we compare the robustness properties of a matching estimator with a doubly robust estimator. We
describe the robustness properties of matching and subclassification estimators by showing how misspecification
of the propensity score model can result in the consistent estimation of an average causal effect. The propensity
scores are covariate scores, which are a class of functions that removes bias due to all observed covariates. When
matching on a parametric model (e.g., a propensity or a prognostic score), the matching estimator is robust to
model misspecifications if the misspecified model belongs to the class of covariate scores. The implication is that
there are multiple possibilities for the matching estimator in contrast to the doubly robust estimator in which the
researcher has two chances to make reliable inference. In simulations, we compare the finite sample properties
of the matching estimator with a simple inverse probability weighting estimator and a doubly robust estimator. For the misspecifications in our study, the mean square error of the matching estimator is smaller than the
mean square error of both the simple inverse probability weighting estimator and the doubly robust estimators.

1. Introduction
In a randomized experiment, systematic differences between treated and controls are avoided by the
random assignment of the treatment. Adopting the definition of a causal effect from the potential outcome framework [1, 2] formalizes the role of randomization for causal inference. When the treatment is
not randomized, the effect of the treatment on the outcome can be confounded with the possible effects
of other variables that are related both to the treatment and to the outcome under study. To identify
the causal effect of the treatment, we have to adjust for these confounding variables. When there are
many pretreatment variables, henceforth referred to as covariates, nonparametric adjustment methods
are infeasible and parametric models are often incorporated into the analysis for dimension reduction
purposes. Researchers [3, 4] commonly use matching and subclassification on the propensity score (PS)
in medical research. The PS, defined as the probability of receiving the treatment given the covariates, is
often described by a parametric model, for example, logistic regression. Another semiparametric alternative is inverse probability weighting (IPW), which uses PSs as weights for the observed responses,
thereby confounding is adjusted for [5]. Abadie and Imbens [6] studied a matching estimator in which
both the treated and controls were matched with replacement on the covariate vector norm. Their results
show that the matching estimator is not generally n1=2 -consistent when matching is performed on more
than one covariate. When matching is carried out on a scalar, the matching estimator is n1=2 -consistent
and asymptotically normal (CAN). Because the PS is a scalar function of the covariates, the results of
Abadie and Imbens for the scalar covariate case directly applies to the matching estimator when matching
is based on the PS. The PS is a balancing score (i.e., a function of the covariates such that the distribution of the covariates is the same for the treated and the controls when conditioning on the balancing
score) [7].

I. WAERNBAUM

Instead of matching on a balancing score, one can match on a summarizing function of the covariates
so that the potential outcomes are independent of the covariates given that function (e.g., an outcome
regression (OR) model). Functions with this property are called prognostic scores [8].
In this paper, we define a class of functions, covariate scores, as functions of the covariates such that
unconfoundedness holds. The covariate scores are linked to the robustness of the matching estimator
because when conditioning on a misspecified model of the covariates, the average causal effect is consistently estimated if the misspecified model belongs to the class of covariate scores. For instance, the
average causal effect can be consistently estimated even when matching on a score that does not achieve
covariate balance. With the use of the results of Abadie and Imbens, a matching estimator is CAN when
matching on a scalar function of the covariates that belongs to the class of covariate scores. Matching
on a function of the covariates belonging to the class of covariate scores provide manifold robustness
properties to model misspecification of parametric models of, for example, a propensity or prognostic
score. The robustness properties of the matching estimator are compared with the robustness properties
of other semiparametric approaches, such as IPW and doubly robust (DR) estimation. A DR estimator,
first proposed by Robins et al. [9] in the context of a general missing data setting, offers a combination
of PS and OR modeling. The DR estimator is an augmentation of the IPW estimator that reduces the sensitivity to parametric model misspecification and improves precision; see Cao et al. [10] for a review of
DR estimators and their properties. The attractive feature of a DR estimator is that it remains CAN when
either one of the parametric models is misspecified. Also, they reach a lower bound for the variance of
the semiparametric estimators of the causal effect [9].
In this article, we investigate the finite sample robustness of the matching estimator when matching on
true and misspecified models of the propensity and prognostic scores. We compare the robustness properties of the matching estimator with IPW and DR estimations using the same model misspecifications.
For a matching estimator, Waernbaum [11] has estimated different model misspecifications of the PS
model in which the misspecified model belongs to the class of balancing scores. This approach results
in consistent estimation of an average causal effect. Comparative studies of causal inference estimators
have reached different conclusions. Studies recommending routine use of the DR estimator [5, 12] stand
in contrast to a study comparing linear regression with DR [13] under model misspecification. In the
latter, the DR estimator was shown to perform poorly when both the model of the outcome and the PS
were misspecified. The current paper contributes to the previous studies by comparing the robustness of
matching to the DR estimation, which is, to our knowledge, not available in the current literature. Here,
the one chance (IPW estimator), two chances (DR estimator), and multiple chances (matching estimator)
of correct model specification are illustrated by the consequences for the finite sample inference about
the average causal effect. The usual trade-off when it comes to bias and variance seems not to be in
effect. From the theory of Robins et al., we know that the DR estimator has a smaller asymptotic variance than the IPW when both the outcome and propensity models are correctly specified, yet it offers
protection against misspecification of the PS model. Matching on an estimated propensity or prognostic
score offers more robustness without losing efficiency in the simulations.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces the theoretical framework and assumptions.
Section 3 describes semiparametric estimation of average causal effects, the class of covariate scores
with its subclasses, and the robustness properties of the matching estimator. We describe the IPW
and DR estimators and compare their robustness properties with the matching estimator. We also
discuss model selection, misspecification, estimation, and the consequences for robustness. Section 4
presents a simulation study that highlights the described robustness properties. Section 5 concludes with
a discussion.

We adopt Rubin’s framework for causal inference as described in [14]. For simplicity, we consider the
case with a binary treatment, T , with a realized value T D 1 if treated and T D 0 if control. The causal
effect of the treatment is defined as the difference between two potential outcomes, Y1  Y0 , where Y1
is the outcome observed under treatment and Y0 is the outcome observed under the control treatment.
The observed outcome is defined by Y D T Y1 C .1  T /Y0 . The average causal effect is the expected
difference in the population ˇ D E.Y1  Y0 / and is the parameter of interest, although a variety of
parameters, such as the causal effect of the treated E.Y1  Y0 j T D 1/, can be considered. For a randomized treatment, the difference in the sample averages of the treated and the controls give an unbiased
estimate of the average causal effect. In an observational study with a nonrandomized treatment, the

I. WAERNBAUM

causal effect can be identified under an assumption of unconfoundedness, that is, the potential outcomes
and the treatment are conditionally independent given a set of pretreatment variables (covariates in the
sequel), X , written
.Y1 ; Y0 / ?
? T jX:

(A.1)

Assumption (A.1), together with an assumption of overlapping distributions,
0 < P .T D 1jX / < 1;

(A.2)

is referred to as strong ignorability [7]. Under strong ignorability, the average causal effect is identified
using only observed data through either

where e.X / D P .T D 1jX / denotes the PS. Weaker versions of (A.1) and (A.2), assuming marginal
conditional independence for Yj ; j D 0; 1, respectively, can also be used [15].
Equations (1) and (2) form the basis of two different estimation approaches. Estimators following
Equation (1), such as the matching and stratification estimators, estimate the causal effect of a subpopulation with covariates X D x and then take the average over the conditional effects. Estimators applying
Equation (2) weight the observed outcome with the inverse probability of receiving the treatment actually
received (e.g., IPW estimators).

3. Robustness properties of semiparametric estimators of an average causal effect
Nonparametric estimation of the average causal effect has the benefit of not extrapolating model assumptions in regions of the covariates where no data is observed [16]. However, nonparametric estimators
[17] of average causal effects are not feasible when there are many covariates. For both categorical and
continuous covariates, having a rich set of covariates in the strong ignorability assumption restricts the
possible use of nonparametric estimators on the basis of both identification strategies (1) and (2) because
of the curse of dimensionality. A semiparametric approach consists of assuming some model(s) for the
components of the joint distribution of the observed data and leaving others unspecified. For instance,
instead of conditioning on X with possibly high dimensionality, conditioning on the scalar PS, e.X /,
under the assumption of strong ignorability is sufficient [7]. Parametric models are often used for the PS,
and researchers have proposed [18, 19] model selection strategies in the literature . In this section, we
start by describing functions of the covariates maintaining the unconfoundedness assumption (e.g., the
propensity and the prognostic score). In Section 3.2, we outline the role of the covariate functions for
the robustness properties of the matching estimator and compare it with the IPW and DR estimators. We
discuss model selection, misspecifications, and consequences for parameter estimation in Section 3.3.
3.1. Covariate scores
Bias associated with differences in the covariates can be removed by adjusting for a summarizing function of the covariates, for example, a balancing score [7]. A balancing score, b.X /, is a function of X
such that
X?
? T jb.X /:

(3)

The term ‘balancing’ comes from the fact that if we condition on a balancing score, the distributions p.X jT D 1; b.X // D p.X jT D 0; b.X //, that is, balanced for treated and controls. Formally,
Rosenbaum and Rubin showed that if (A.1) and (A.2) holds, then .Y1 ; Y0 / ?
? T j b.X / and 0 < P .T D
1 j b.X // < 1. The PS is a balancing score. For any function of X to be a balancing score, we have the
following theorem.

Theorem 1 ([7])

Hansen [8] described the prognostic score, another function that is sufficient for unconfoundedness.
A prognostic score is defined as
X?
? Y0 j .X /:
If P .Y1 jY0 ; X / D P .Y1 jY0 /, then we have what Hansen denoted as no effect modification implying
that
X?
? Y1 j .X /:
Effect modification exists, for instance, when we have an interaction effect between the covariates
and the treatment in the model for the observed outcome. If this is the case, denoting by m.X / an effect
modifier, we have
X?
? Y1 j .X /; m.X /:
The balancing and prognostic scores share the key property that they are dimension-reducing functions of the covariates and are sufficient to condition on to maintain unconfoundedness. In the following text, we define a class of functions, covariate scores, as functions of the covariates sufficient for
unconfoundedness.
Definition 2 (Covariate score)
A covariate score c.X / is a function of the covariates such that
.Y1 ; Y0 / ?
? T j c.X /:
If (A.1) holds, then a trivial covariate score is c.X / D X , the vector itself. Also, there exists a scalar
covariate score in the PS, e.X / D P .T D 1jX /. Motivated by the robustness results in the sequel, the
stronger version of joint conditional independence is used, although marginal conditional independence
statements are sufficient for the identification of an average causal effect.
The average causal effect can be identified by conditioning on c.X /
Proposition 3 (Identification with covariate scores)
Assume (A.1) and 0 < P .T D 1 j c.X // < 1, then E.Y1  Y0 / D EfE.Y j c.X /; T D 1/  E.Y j
c.X /; T D 0/g.
Proof
We have E.Y j c.X /; T D 1/ D E.Y1 j c.X /; T D 1/ and E.Y j c.x/; T D 0/ D E.Y0 j c.x/; T D 0/.
By (A.1), E.Y1 j c.X /; T D 1/ D E.Y1 j c.X //, E.Y0 j c.X /; T D 0/ D E.Y0 j c.X //, and
0 < P .T D 1 j c.X // < 1, we can identify E.Y1  Y0 / D EfE.Y1  Y0 j c.x//g.

Remark 4
A covariate score, c.X /, can be such that either T ?
? X j c.X / or .Y0 ; Y1 / ?
? X j c.X /, neither of the
cases or both.
The first two cases follow directly from the results in [7, 8] (with some adjustments for the joint
independence). It is also trivial to construct scenarios when the two cases coincide.

In Example 5, we have a covariate score, c.X /, both a prognostic and a balancing score if for instance
c.X / D ˛1 X1 C ˛2 X2 D a.1 X1 C 2 X2 /, for a constant a. A function of the covariates can be a score
without being either a balancing score [7] or a prognostic score [8]. To see this, we use the following
lemma [20]:
Lemma 6 ([20])
Let X D fW; Zg. Assume that .Y0 ; Y1 / ?

In Example 7, we have c.X / D X2 and neither T ?
scores that are neither balancing scores nor prognostic scores are closely related to variables in the set X
that are related solely to the treatment or the outcome. Such variables are redundant in the unconfoundedness assumption, (A.1). Researchers have proposed the selection of sufficient subsets of covariates for
the identification of an average causal effect (see e.g., de Luna, Waernbaum and Richardson, forthcoming
in Biometrika) [21]; however, this selection process is not the primary interest of this paper.
3.2. Comparing matching, inverse probability weighting, and doubly robust estimators
Abadie and Imbens described a matching estimator that matches both treated and controls with replacement to a fixed number of matches using the Euclidean vector norm [6]. They established n1=2 consistency and asymptotic normality for their estimator when matching on a continuous scalar covariate
[6, Cor.1]. In a recent working paper, they showed that this result also holds for the PS when it is estimated using maximum likelihood (unpublished Abadie and Imbens, 2009). For a scalar covariate score,
the results are applicable whenever there is at least one continuous covariate in X .
Consider the distance dij between two individuals i and j from opposite treatment groups,
dij Dj c.Xi /  c.Xj / j :

(4)

For each i, define a set J D f1; 2; : : : ; j; : : : ; mg of indices for the m smallest order statistics di.j / . We
can write a matching estimator, ˇSM , that matches treated and controls to a fixed number of m matches as

Remark 8
When matching on a scalar, for example, a true or misspecified PS or prognostic score, the matching
estimator is CAN if the model belongs to the class of covariate scores.
Another class of estimators, called IPW estimators, weight the observed outcome by the inverse

A DR estimator is an augmentation of ˇOIPW . A prototypical DR estimator of the average causal
effect, ˇDR , is defined in the following text, see Reference [22] for an elaborate derivation. An estimator of ˇ is DR if it remains CAN when either the model for the PS or a model for the OR

Lunceford and Davidian [5] have described the large sample properties of the estimator ˇODR . The extension of each term in ˇOIPW with the expression involving the regression increases the efficiency of ˇODR
compared with ˇOIPW so that it reaches the semiparametric efficiency bound described by Robins et al.
The asymptotic variances of the respective estimators are denoted by V .ˇOSM /; V .ˇODR /; and V .ˇOIPW /.
With the use of the comparison of the estimators from [5], V .ˇODR / 6 V .ˇOIPW / if the PS is correctly
modeled. From earlier results, V .ˇOIPW / 6 V .ˇOSM /, although the variance of ˇOSM does not take into
account any estimation procedure of the scalar matched on [6, 23]. In the working paper by Abadie and
Imbens concerning matching on an estimated PS, they showed an increase in efficiency as compared
with matching on the true PS. However, no general insights concerning the large sample variance when
matching on an estimated PS compared with the large sample variance of an IPW or DR estimator have
been determined.
Comparing the estimators with respect to robustness, we have that the matching estimator defined in
Equation (5) and the DR estimator defined in Equation (7) are both robust. These estimators yield consistent estimates to certain misspecifications of the underlying parametric models, whereas the IPW in
Equation (6) relies entirely on a correctly specified model for the PS. The way that the matching estimator is robust differs from the DR estimator. The DR estimator has two chances of making the outcome
or propensity model correct, whereas the matching estimator is robust as long as the resulting matching
criterion in Equation (4) belongs to the class of covariate scores.
3.3. Model selection, misspecification, and estimation
Model selection strategies for the PS are often based on the balancing property (3). A forward procedure starts with a sparse logistic regression model containing the main effects of the covariates. After
the model fit, the balance is checked for all of the covariates when conditioning on the fitted PS. If a
covariate lacks balance (e.g., there is a significant mean difference between treated and controls with
respect to the covariate), a second order or interaction term is added to the model. The model is refitted
and reevaluated until there are no significant differences in the means for the treated and the controls
[18, 19]. A possible result of using the described procedure is specifying a balancing score that is not
the true PS. Examples of potential misspecifications are selecting a linear predictor of lower order than
the order of the correct model or choosing the wrong link function [11]. PS model estimation has the
benefit of using the data .T; X / observed for the whole sample. A prognostic score, .X /, as defined in
Equation (3.1) uses only the control group for the estimation, O .X /. Hansen [8] further discussed the
effects of overfitting and complications associated with effect modification when estimating a model for
the prognostic score.
To this point, we have discussed models falling within the class of covariate scores. In practice, a
covariate score such as the propensity or the prognostic score is estimated with the observed data. Misspecifying a model for the covariate score raises the question of the value of the fitted covariate score.
Consider a generalized linear model generating the PS
e.X / D P .T D 1 j X / D H.X 0 ˇ/;

where ˇ is a vector of slope parameters and H 1 is the link function. If the true model is Equation (8),
the linear predictor, X 0 ˇ, is a balancing score and is sufficient to use as a matching criterion. If ˇ is consistently estimated up to scale (i.e., if we estimate aˇ for a constant a), then X 0 aˇ is a balancing score
and is sufficient to use as a matching criterion [11]. Maximum likelihood estimators and semiparametric

estimators can consistently identify ˇ up to scale under general misspecifications (see Reference [24]
for a summary). Some relevant examples are misspecifying the link function, omitting a variable in the
linear predictor and model fitting with least squares regression.

4. Simulations
The purpose of the simulations presented here is to investigate the finite sample robustness for the three
estimators ˇOSM , ˇOIPW , and ˇODR . We estimate the average causal effect using the fitted values from a correct and a misspecified PS model as well as the fitted values from a correct and misspecified OR model.
We use the linear predictor using the fitted values of the parameters as a prognostic score. In ˇODR , we
use the fitted OR models as defined in Equation (7). For the misspecified propensity and prognostic
scores, the misspecifications are models belonging to the covariate scores, and the matching estimator
is consistent for the average causal effect as a result. We approximate the sampling distribution of the
estimators using 1000 replicates for each of the three sample sizes N D 500, N D 1000, and N D 3000.
We generate two covariates, X1 and X2 , that are both uniformly distributed on the interval .1; 5/.

yielding an average causal effect, ˇ D 2. The misspecification of the PS model consists of fitting a standard normal distribution function instead of the logistic function. Misspecifying the OR is carried out by
choosing the identity link function instead of the log link in a Poisson regression.
We present the results in Table I. Using a probit or logit gives almost identical results for the matching
estimator. Similarly, the current misspecifications for the prognostic scores do not have any impact on
the estimation of ˇ. The bias and variance also decreases as the sample size increases. When at least one
of the two models is correctly specified, ˇODR has almost no bias. When both link functions are misspecified, the bias increases and does not decrease with the larger sample size. The standard deviation for
ˇODR when both models are wrong is almost twice the standard deviation of ˇOSM . As a result, the mean
squared error (MSE) is larger for ˇODR than for ˇOSM for all of the estimated covariate scores except when
both the PS model and the OR model are correctly specified. The MSEs of ˇOIPW for both the correct and
incorrect models are larger than the MSEs of ˇOSM for all of the covariate scores.

where "0 and "1 are standard normal random variables independent of each other and of the covariates
yielding an average causal effect, ˇ D 2. For the misspecifications, we fit both the PS model and the
OR model without any second order and interaction terms. In the matching estimator, we used the linear
predictor of the fitted OR as a prognostic score.
Table II shows the results from Simulation 2. The simple matching estimator gives similar results
for the correct and misspecified PSs as well as for the correct and misspecified prognostic scores with
respect to bias. The standard deviation for the simple matching estimator is largest when using the true
PS model (see [11, Proposition 9] for a theoretical elaboration). As expected, ˇODR has almost no bias
when at least one of the two models is correctly specified. When the order of both models is misspecified, the bias is large and does not decrease as the sample size increases. The standard deviation for ˇODR
when both models are wrong is almost the same as ˇOSM matching on a correctly specified PS model.
Because the bias is much larger for ˇOxDR , matching on any of the estimated covariate scores yielded a
smaller MSE. Again, the MSEs of ˇOxIPW for both the correct and incorrect models are larger than the
MSEs of ˇOSM for all of the covariate scores.

5. Discussion
Researchers [25] have suggested that PS model misspecification is not a major problem as long as the
covariate distributions are balanced between the treated units and the controls. In this paper, we further
show the generality of matching robustness because matching on any score that is a covariate score will
result in consistent estimation of the average causal effect, even when the covariates are not balanced
between the treated and the controls. Also, the matching estimator is robust to model misspecifications
when the DR estimator is not. For the DR estimator, we have two chances of modeling it correctly, one
for the PS model and one for the OR model. For the matching estimator, matching on any covariate
score results in a CAN estimator. Different mechanisms are involved for the different estimators. For
an IPW estimator, we generate the missing data by letting each observed outcome count for 1=e.X /
outcomes with similar covariates. Here, we use the PS as a conditional probability of being treated given
the covariates. When matching or stratifying on a covariate score, we use the score to block the confounding between the treatment and the potential outcomes. Here, it suffices that the score successfully
disrupts the confounding somewhere between the treatment and the outcome as described in Lemma 6
by Robins [20].
In our simulations, we consider the nonlinearity in the models not to be apparent for a data analyst
when exploring the data. Similar to our conclusions, matching on linear models has been found efficient
for bias reduction when the response variables are moderately nonlinear [26, 27].
For the purpose of showing consistency and asymptotic normality, the focus has been on scalar covariate scores throughout the paper, although a covariate score can also be vector valued. The matching
estimator described by Abadie and Imbens is consistent for a larger dimension than a scalar, although
asymptotic normality is not obtained.
