This paper defines and analyzes a new monotonicity condition for the identification
of counterfactuals and treatment effects in unordered discrete choice models with multiple treatments, heterogeneous agents, and discrete-valued instruments. Unordered
monotonicity implies and is implied by additive separability of choice of treatment equations in terms of observed and unobserved variables. These results follow from properties of binary matrices developed in this paper. We investigate conditions under which
unordered monotonicity arises as a consequence of choice behavior. We characterize
IV estimators of counterfactuals as solutions to discrete mixture problems.

1. INTRODUCTION
THE EVALUATION OF ECONOMIC POLICIES is a central goal of econometrics.1 Economists
have long used instrumental variables (IV) to identify policy-relevant parameters.2 Early
econometricians used IV to identify parameters in systems of linear simultaneous equations. In that framework, economists can safely be agnostic about the models generating
choices in estimating a variety of interesting policy counterfactuals if their instruments
satisfy rank and exogeneity conditions.
This agnostic stance is not justified in models with heterogeneous responses in which
decisions to take treatment are based on unobserved3 components of those responses.
Without additional assumptions, instrumental variables do not identify interpretable

causal parameters. Choice mechanisms play a fundamental role in interpreting what instruments identify.
For binary and ordered versions of IV models, Imbens and Angrist (1994) showed that
monotonicity facilitates identification of certain instrument-defined causal parameters.
This condition requires that responses to changes in instruments move all people toward
or against the same choices.4 It is a condition about the uniformity of the direction of
responses across persons in responses to changes in instruments.5 In binary and ordered
choice models, monotonicity coupled with standard IV assumptions permits economists
to identify certain causal effects on outcomes of changes in the choices induced by variation in the instruments. Different instruments generally identify different parameters.6
For a nonparametric binary choice Generalized Roy model, Vytlacil (2002) showed that
monotonicity is equivalent to assuming that treatment choice equations can be characterized by an additively separable latent-variable threshold-crossing model. Separability is
defined in terms of observed and unobserved (by the economist) variables. Vytlacil (2006)
extended his analysis to the case of ordered multiple choice models where the order is
placed on the possible outcome variables (e.g., years of schooling).
This paper contributes to the literature by extending the analysis of instrumental variables to a general model of unordered choices. We develop a natural generalization
of monotonicity—unordered monotonicity—that applies to models with multiple choices
without a natural order among the choice values. For example, the choice of a pet among
the set {cat, dog, bird} is only ordered by the preferences of agents across choices and not
necessarily by the characteristics of the outcomes of choices. Unordered monotonicity
preserves the intuitive notion of weak uniformity of responses to changes in instruments
across persons without assuming any cardinalization on choice outcomes. We demonstrate how unordered monotonicity arises in choice models and examine which counterfactuals and causal parameters and weights are identified by different configurations of
instruments. Like its counterpart in ordered choice models, unordered monotonicity identifies a mixture of LATEs with identifiable weights. We cannot identify the causal effect
subcomponents of the mixture of LATEs, but we can identify certain counterfactuals.
Identification of causal effects in unordered choice models was studied by Heckman,
Urzúa, and Vytlacil (2006), Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b), and Heckman, Urzúa, and
Vytlacil (2008) who identified a variety of economically interpretable treatment effects.
They assumed that the equations generating treatment choices are governed by additively separable threshold-crossing models. Their identification strategy relies critically
on instruments that assume values on a continuum. They also invoked “identification at
infinity,” as does a large literature in structural economics.7 In this paper, we show that
these assumptions can be relaxed and identification of causal effects can still be secured.

This concept is more accurately interpreted as “uniformity” and does not correspond to ordinary mathematical definitions of monotonicity. See Heckman and Vytlacil (2005, 2007a).

See Heckman, Urzúa, and Vytlacil (2006).

For the binary choice model, these are the LATE parameters of Imbens and Angrist (1994). Their extension
of LATE to situations with multiple choices assumes that indicators of choice are naturally ordered (e.g., years
of schooling). It assumes a meaningful scalar aggregator can be constructed that is monotonic in the ordered
indicators of choice (Angrist and Imbens (1995)). They identified a mixture of LATEs where the component
weights, but not the component LATEs, are identified individually. In general, LATE does not identify a variety
of policy-relevant parameters. See Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b) or Heckman (2010).

We rely only on discrete-valued instruments—the case commonly encountered in empirical work.8
This paper introduces economists to the identifying and interpretive power of binary
matrices. We state the necessary and sufficient conditions for identification of counterfactuals in terms of conditions on binary matrices. We establish an equivalence result that
connects unordered monotonicity and separability of choice equations. Separability is not
imposed on the underlying choice equations.
However, unordered monotonicity implies and is implied by representations of choice
equations that are additively separable in observed and unobserved variables. We show
that this equivalence result stems from the properties of binary matrices that characterize choice sets. We determine the counterfactual outcomes that are identified under unordered monotonicity and present equations that facilitate estimation of the identified
parameters.9
This paper proceeds in the following way. Section 2 defines a general model of multiple choices and categorical instrumental variables. Section 3 presents a general framework for studying identification of counterfactuals and causal parameters in the general
model. Our framework is based on partitioning the population into strata corresponding
to counterfactual treatment choices. Section 4 presents a new characterization of the IV
identification problem using a finite mixture model with restrictions on admissible vectors of counterfactual choices. We state necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying
causal parameters. We illustrate these conditions for a binary choice (LATE) model. We
show the simplicity and power of our analytical framework by deriving Vytlacil’s equivalence result (2002) in a transparent way. Section 5 defines unordered monotonicity and
illustrates how it arises in choice-theoretic models. Section 6 presents equivalence theorems that relate the properties of unordered monotonicity and the separability of choice
equations. We interpret these equivalence results in light of economic theory. Section 7
applies this analysis to identify causal parameters. We establish the role of choice theory
in securing identifiability. Section 8 concludes.
2. A CHOICE-THEORETIC MODEL OF INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES
Our model consists of five (possible vector-valued) random variables defined on probability space (Ω F  P), two policy-invariant (vector) equations that determine causal relationships among the variables, and an independence condition:10
Choice Equations :
Outcome Equations :

T = fT (Z V )

(1)

Y = fY (T V  Y )

Independence Condition :

V  Z Y

are mutually independent

(2)
(3)

8
Continuity of instruments and full support produce identifiability in our model, but are not required. See
Heckman and Pinto (2015a). In related work, Lee and Salanié (2016) used a general framework to investigate
multivalued choice models defined by separable threshold-crossing rules. They showed that the identification
of causal effects is possible with enough variation in instrumental variables that assume values on a continuum
(“identification at infinity”).
9
For an empirical application of unordered monotonicity, see Pinto (2016a), who evaluated the Moving to
Opportunity Experiment.
10
By policy-invariant, we mean functions whose maps remain invariant under manipulation of the arguments. This is the notation of autonomy developed by Frisch (1938) and Haavelmo (1944). For a recent discussion of these conditions, see Heckman and Pinto (2015b).

Variables (Z T Y Y  V ) have the following properties. P1: Instrument Z is a categorical
random variable with support supp(Z) = {z1      zNZ };11 P2: Treatment (or Choice) indicator T is a discrete-valued random variable with support supp(T ) = {t1      tNT }; P3: Y is
an observed random variable denoting outcomes arising from treatment; P4: Y is an unobserved error term;12 P5: V is a confounder—an unobserved random vector (possibly infinite
dimensional) affecting both choices and outcomes. We assume that the expectation of each
component of Y exists. We also assume that the distribution of T varies conditional on
each value of Z, that is, P(T = t|Z = z) > 0 for all t ∈ supp(T ) and z ∈ supp(Z). Vector (Zω ; Tω ; Yω ; V ω ) denotes the realization of these variables for an element ω ∈ Ω. To
simplify notation, background variables unaffected by treatment are kept implicit. Our
analysis is conditional on such variables.
Counterfactual outcome Y (t) is defined by fixing the argument T of the outcome Equation (2) to t ∈ supp(T ), that is, Y (t) = fY (t V  Y ). The observed outcome Y (Equation (2)) is the output of a Quandt (1972) switching regression model:

Y (t) · 1[T = t] ≡ Y (T )
(4)
Y=
t∈supp(T )

where 1[α] is an indicator function that takes value 1 if α is true and 0 otherwise. Counterfactual choice T (z) = fT (z V ) is defined by fixing the argument Z of the choice equation (2) to z ∈ supp(Z).13 Observed choice is given by

T (z) · 1[Z = z] ≡ T (Z)
(5)
T=
z∈supp(Z)

REMARK 2.1: The binary Generalized Roy model (Heckman and Vytlacil (2007a)) is a
special case of this model in which V is a scalar random variable V , the choice is binary
T ∈ {0 1}, and the choice equation is defined by an indicator function that is separable in
Z and V , namely, T = fT (Z V ) ≡ 1[τ(Z) ≥ V ]. In this paper, we analyze multiple choices
and impose no restriction on the functional forms of the choice equations (1) or outcome
equations (2). Instead, we make restrictions on counterfactual choices and examine how
those restrictions affect the characterization of choice equations.
Independence condition (3) generates the following properties:


Exclusion Restriction :
V  Y (t) ⊥⊥ Z
Conditional Independence (Matching) Property :

Y (t) ⊥⊥ T |V 

(6)
(7)

Equation (6) states that instrument Z is independent of counterfactual outcome Y (t)
and the confounding variable V that generates selection bias. It implies that instrument
Z affects Y only through its effect on T . Equation (7) states that Y (t) is independent of
11
The assumption that Z is a multiple-valued scalar is a convenience. We can vectorize a matrix of instruments into a scalar form. Thus, we accommodate multiple instruments defined in the usual way.
12
Such error terms are often called “shocks” in structural equation models. fT is a random function that
could be written as a deterministic function if we introduce shock T of arbitrary dimension as an argument of
the function, where T is independent of V and Y .
13
Fixing is a causal operation that captures the notion of external (ceteris paribus) manipulation. It is a central
concept in the study of causality and dates back to Haavelmo (1943). See Heckman and Pinto (2015b) for a
recent discussion of fixing and causality.

(8)

Any solution to the problem of selection bias requires that the analyst control for, or
balance, unobserved V across treatment and control states.14
We control for V by partitioning the sample space Ω so that the treatment indicator T
is independent of counterfactual outcomes within each partition set. Consider a partition
N
of Ω: Ω = n=1 Ωn ; Ωn ∩ Ωn = ∅ ∀n n ∈ {1     N} n = n , with an associated indicator
N
Hω that takes the value n ∈ {1     N} if ω ∈ Ωn , that is, Hω = n=1 n · 1[ω ∈ Ωn ]. If the
following relationship holds within each partition:
Y (t) ⊥⊥ T |(H = n);

∀n ∈ {1     N}

(9)

then T is effectively randomly assigned conditional on H = n. If such partitions were
known, one could apply the logic underlying Equation (8) to evaluate counterfactual outcome E(Y (t)|H = n) using E(Y |T = t H = n). If T takes the value t with strictly positive
probability in all partition sets, that is, Pr(T = t|H = n) > 0; n ∈ {1     N}, E(Y (t)) can
N
be constructed from E(Y (t)) = n=1 E(Y |T = t H = n)P(H = n). Our identification
strategy uses instrumental variable Z to generate partitions {Ωn }Nn=1 that satisfy Equation (9). To do so, we use response vectors, which we define next.
3. RESPONSE VECTORS AND IDENTIFYING OR BOUNDING OF MEAN COUNTERFACTUALS
AND WEIGHTS ON COUNTERFACTUALS

Response Vector S is defined as a NZ -dimensional random vector of counterfactual
treatment choices T for Z fixed at each value of its support:
 


S = T (z1 )     T (zNZ ) = fT (V  z1 )     fT (V  zNZ ) ≡ fS (V )

(10)

where T (z) denotes a counterfactual treatment choice when instrumental variable Z is
fixed at z ∈ supp(Z). Let supp(S) = {s1      sNS } denote the finite support of S. The NZ dimensional vectors s ∈ supp(S) are termed response-types or strata.15 S plays a funda14
Counterfactual E(Y (t)) and conditional expectation E(Y |T = t) differ if the conditional and unconditional distributions of V are different: E(Y (t)) = E(Y (t)|V = v) dFV (v) = E(Y |V = v T =
t) dFV |T =t (v) = E(Y |T = t) where FV is the CDF of V and FV |T =t is the CDF of V conditional on T = t.
See Heckman and Pinto (2015b).
15
Different notions of response vectors are used in the literature. In our notation, response vectors correspond to the choices a person of type V would make when confronted by different values of Z. Robins and
Greenland (1992) initiated the literature. Frangakis and Rubin (2002) used the term “principal strata.” They
did not explicitly model V or use the econometric framework (1)–(3) so the relationship between strata and V
and the fact that conditioning on S is equivalent to conditioning on regions of V are only implicit in their analysis. T (z) can potentially take as many as NT values for each value z ∈ supp(Z). Since Z has | supp(Z)| = NZ
elements, supp(S) can have at most NTNZ elements.

mental role in our analysis. T is related to S in the following way:


T = 1[Z = z1 ]     1[Z = zNZ ] · S ≡ gT (S Z)16

(11)

Equation (10) uses the fact that after fixing Z = z, S is a function only of unobserved V .
Conditioning on S effectively conditions on the regions of V that map into S by Equation (10).17 It is a coarse way of conditioning on V .
3.1. Properties of Response Vectors
Lemma L-1 establishes four useful properties of response vectors analogous to properties shared with V .

Q.E.D.

Relationship (i) states that counterfactual outcomes Y (t) for all t ∈ supp(T ) are independent of treatment choices conditional on S. Thus, S shares the same conditional
independence (matching) properties as V in (7). Relationship (ii) states that the potential treatment choices in S are independent of the instrumental variables. Relationship
(iii) states that outcomes are independent of treatment choices conditional on S and Z.
Indeed, from (11), T is deterministic conditional on S and Z. Relationship (iv) is closely
related to (iii). It states that outcome Y is independent of instrumental variable Z when
conditioned on S and T .
REMARK 3.1: Response vector S generates a partition of the sample space Ω that has
independence property (9). Function fS : supp(V ) → supp(S) in (10) is constructed using
function fT defined by (1). Thus, for each ω ∈ Ω, there is a single value v ∈ supp(V ) such
that V ω = v and a single value s ∈ supp(S) such that fS (v) = s. We define a partition of
the sample space Ω by

(12)
Ωn = ω ∈ Ω; fS (V ω ) = sn
for each sn ∈ supp(S)
In partition (12), Sω = sn and ω ∈ Ωn are equivalent. This partition satisfies (9) because
Y (t) ⊥⊥ T |(ω ∈ Ωn ) holds due to item (i) of Lemma L-1. Hence, treatment choice can
be interpreted as being randomly assigned conditional on S. Indeed, conditional on S,
treatment T only depends on Z, which is statistically independent of V .
Response vector S is a balancing score for V .18 It exploits the properties of instruments
Z to generate a coarse partition of unobserved variable V while maintaining the independence properties arising from conditioning on V . The matching condition Y (t) ⊥⊥ T |S is
16
Figure S4 in Supplemental Material Appendix B displays our IV model with response vector S as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
17
The regions are distinct because fT (·) is a function.
18
S being a balancing score means that properties of V are inherited by S. Formally, S = fS (V ) is a surjective
function of V that satisfies Y (t) ⊥⊥ T |V ⇒ Y (t) ⊥⊥ T |fS (V ), and σ(S) ⊆ σ(V ) where σ denotes a σ-algebra
in the probability space (Ω F  P).

analogous to Y (t) ⊥⊥ T |V in (7). If S (or V ) were known, counterfactual outcomes (conditional on S (or V )) can be identified by conditioning on S or V .19 Thus, S plays the role
of a control function (Heckman and Robb (1985)). From Equation (8), Y (t) ⊥⊥ T |S implies that E(Y (t)|S = s) = E(Y |T = t S = s). If P(T = t|S = s) > 0 for all s ∈ supp(S),
counterfactual mean outcomes can be expressed as

E(Y |T = t S = s)P(S = s)

S acts as a coarse surrogate for V and identifies treatment effects within strata by balancing
unobservables V across treatment states.
3.2. The Strata Identification Problem
The problem of identifying counterfactual mean outcomes defined for each stratum
consists of identifying unobserved E(Y (t)|S = s) and P(S = s) for s ∈ supp(S) and t ∈
supp(T ), from observed E(Y |T = t Z = z) and P(T = t|Z = z) for z ∈ supp(Z) and
t ∈ supp(T ). Theorem T-1 uses the relationships of Lemma L-1 to express unobserved
objects in terms of observed ones.
THEOREM T-1: The following equality holds for the IV model (1)–(3):

where κ : supp(Y ) → R is an arbitrary known function.
PROOF: See Supplemental Material Appendix A.2.

Replacing κ(Y ) by any variable X such that X ⊥⊥ T |S, we obtain:21

1[T = t|S = s Z]E(X|S = s)P(S = s)

(16)

19

See Heckman (2008) for a survey of a wide array of methods that implement this principle.
If we set κ(Y ) = Y , we equate expected values of observed outcomes with expected counterfactual outcomes. Setting κ(Y ) = 1[Y ≤ y], we equate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the observed outcome with the unobserved CDF of counterfactual outcomes.
21
Candidates for X are baseline variables caused by V . Knowledge of the X variables helps to identify the
observed characteristics of persons within strata.

REMARK 3.2: Equation (14) characterizes the problem of identifying counterfactual
outcomes within strata. There are NZ observed objects on the left-hand side for each
t ∈ supp(T ) totalling NZ · NT . Without further restrictions, the total number of latent
N
response-types on the right-hand side is NT Z , that is, the number of strata. Thus, the
number of observed quantities (NT · NZ ) grows linearly in NZ while the number of posN
sible response-types (NT Z ) grows geometrically in NZ .22 Identification requires that constraints be placed on the number of admissible strata (S). Choice theory can produce such
restrictions, as can other assumptions, such as those about functional forms.
Indicator 1[T = t|S = s Z = z] in Equation (14) is deterministic because T is deterministic given Z and S in Equation (11). Our identification strategy develops economically
interpretable restrictions on these indicators that govern the choice of treatment as Z
varies. Such restrictions reduce the number of admissible response-types and characterize the indicators 1[T = t|S = s Z = z], facilitating identification of causal parameters.
We note, for later use, that the probability of treatment choice conditional on responsetypes is

1[T = t|S = s Z = z]P(Z = z|S = s)
P(T = t|S = s) =
z∈supp(Z)

=



1[T = t|S = s Z = z]P(Z = z)

(17)

z∈supp(Z)

where the last equality is a consequence of S ⊥⊥ Z (item (ii) of Lemma L-1).
Note that Equation (14) is a discrete mixture latent class model, a feature we exploit
below.23 Our paper differs from previous work on nonparametric instrumental variables.
Instead of forming the usual nonparametric IV moment equations (see, e.g., Carrasco,
Florens, and Renault (2007)), we use instruments to construct strata that generate the
kernels of finite mixture equations and choice theory to place restrictions on the kernels.
We then use finite mixture methods to examine the identification of the component causal
parameters on the right-hand side of Equations (14)–(16).
4. IDENTIFYING RESPONSE PROBABILITIES AND COUNTERFACTUAL OUTCOMES
We now present general conditions for identifying response probabilities, counterfactual outcomes, and pre-program variables conditioned on strata. To do so, it is useful to express Equations (14)–(15) as a system of linear equations. Define P Z (t) =
[P(T = t|Z = z1 )     P(T = t|Z = zNZ )] , the vector of observed choice probabilities
(“propensity scores”). Define P Z as the vector that stacks P Z (t) across t ∈ supp(T ): P Z =
[P Z (t1 )     P Z (tNT )] . QZ (t) is defined in an analogous fashion for outcomes defined for
different values of T (i.e., multiplied by the treatment indicators). In a similar fashion,
LZ (t) stands for vector X such that X ⊥⊥ T |S Z. The left-hand sides of Equations (14)
and (16) are given respectively by QZ (t) = [E(κ(Y )·1[T = t]|Z = z1 )     E(κ(Y )·1[T =
t]|Z = zNZ )] , and LZ (t) = [E(X · 1[T = t]|Z = z1 )     E(X · 1[T = t]|Z = zNZ )] , where
LZ = [LZ (t1 )     LZ (tNT )] .
Across the two equation systems for T and scalar Y there are (2 · NT − 1) · NZ observed quantities and
(NT )2·NZ +1 unknown parameters.

Let P S be the vector of unobserved response probabilities P S = [P(S = s1 )     P(S =
sNS )] and LS = [E(X · 1[S = s1 ])     E(X · 1[S = sNS ])] be the unobserved vector of Xexpectations times response indicators. We denote the vector of the expected outcomes

The following notation and concepts are used throughout the rest of this paper. Define response matrix R as an array of response-types defined over supp(S), that is,
R = [s1      sNS ]. To avoid trivial degeneracies, we delete redundant rows (where different values of Z produce the same pattern for T ) and redundant columns (where the
same choices are made for the same value of Z). Matrix R has dimension NZ × NS . An
element in the ith row and nth column of R is denoted by R[i n] = (T |Z = zi  S = sn ); i ∈
{1     NZ } n ∈ {1     NS }. We use R[i ·] to denote the ith row of R, R[· n] for the nth
column of R.
Let Bt denote a binary matrix of the same dimension as R, whose elements take value
1 if the respective element in R is equal to t and zero otherwise. Notationally, we define
an element in the ith row and nth column of matrix Bt by Bt [i n] = 1[T = t|Z = zi  S =
sn ]; i ∈ {1     NZ } n ∈ {1     NS }. We also use the short-hand notation Bt = 1[R = t] to
denote Bt . Let BT be a binary matrix of dimension (NZ · NT ) × NS generated by stacking
Bt as t ranges over supp(T ) : BT = [Bt1      BtN ] .

If Bt and BT were invertible, QS (t), P S , and LS would be identified. However, such
inverses do not always exist. In their place, we can use generalized inverses.
Let B+T and B+t be the Moore–Penrose pseudo-inverses24 of matrices BT and Bt ; t ∈
supp(T ), respectively. The following expressions are useful for characterizing the identification of response probabilities and counterfactual means:
KT = I NS − B+T BT

and

Kt = I NS − B+t Bt ;

t ∈ supp(T )

(21)

where I NS denotes an identity matrix of dimension NS . KT and Kt are orthogonal projection matrices that depend only on binary matrices BT and Bt ; t ∈ supp(T ).25
Applying the Moore–Penrose inverse to (18) and (19), we obtain
P S = B+T P Z + KT λ

(22)

QS (t) = B+t QZ (t) + Kt λ̃

(23)

where λ and λ̃ are arbitrary NS -dimensional vectors (same dimension as P S ). In this notation, Theorem T-2 states general conditions for identification of response probabilities
and counterfactual means.
24
The Moore–Penrose inverse of a matrix A is denoted by A+ and is defined by the four following properties:
(1) AA+ A = A; (2) A+ AA+ = A+ ; (3) A+ A is symmetric; (4) AA+ is symmetric. The Moore–Penrose matrix
A+ of a real matrix A is unique and always exists (Magnus and Neudecker (1999)).

THEOREM T-2: For IV model (1)–(3), if there exists a real-valued NS -dimensional vector ξ
such that ξ KT = 0, then ξ P S and ξ LS are identified. In addition, if there exists a real-valued
NS -dimensional vector ζ such that ζ  Kt = 0, then ζ  QS (t) is identified.
PROOF: See Supplemental Material Appendix A.3.

Q.E.D.

Theorem T-2 shows the identifying properties of the response matrix. For example,
suppose that BT has full column-rank. Then B+T BT = I NS and KT = 0. Therefore, ξ P S is
identified for any real vector ξ of dimension NS . In particular, ξ P S is identified when ξ is
set to be each column vector of the identity matrix I NS . In that case, each nth column of
I NS identifies P(S = sn ) and all the response-type probabilities are identified.26
Note that full-rank for BT does not imply full-rank for each Bt ; t ∈ supp(T ). Therefore,
the identification of the response-type probabilities does not automatically produce identification of corresponding mean counterfactual outcomes. Corollary C-1 formalizes this
discussion.
COROLLARY C-1: The following relationships hold for the IV model (1)–(3):
vectors P S and LS are point-identified ⇔ rank(BT ) = NS 
vector QS (t) is point-identified ⇔ rank(Bt ) = NS 

(24)
(25)

Also, if (25) holds, then E(κ(Y (t))) is identified by ι B+t QZ (t), where ι is a NS -dimensional
vector of 1’s.
PROOF: See Supplemental Material Appendix A.5.

Q.E.D.

Versions of Corollary C-1 are found in the literature on the identifiability of finite mixtures.27 Given binary matrices BT , and Bt ; t ∈ {1 · NT }, the problem of identifying P S  LS ,
and QS (t) is equivalent to the problem of identifying finite mixtures of distributions where
the BT and Bt play the roles of kernels of mixtures. Mixture components are the corresponding counterfactual outcomes conditional on the response-types and mixture probabilities are the response-type probabilities.
One approach to identifiability is to simply assume that conditions (24) and (25) apply
to R. A more satisfactory approach, and the one taken here and in Pinto (2016a), investigates how alternative specifications of choice relationships generate response matrices R
that satisfy the identifiability requirements of Theorem T-2 and Corollary C-1.
It is important to note that we have given conditions for identifying counterfactual
means within strata, E(Y (t)|S). Treatment effects are derived from, but are distinct
from, these counterfactual means. Mean treatment effects are comparisons of different
counterfactuals within the same set of strata: E(Y (t) − Y (t  )|S ∈ Σ) for t = t  , where
Σ ⊆ supp(S) is a subset-set of strata that might consist of a single element. In Section 7,
we discuss identification of mean treatment effects, which is a more demanding problem.

UNORDERED MONOTONICITY

4.1. Example: Binary Choice (LATE)
To familiarize the reader with our notation and concepts, and anticipate our generalization of it, consider the binary choice model implicit in the Local Average Treatment Effect—LATE. Treatment variable T takes two values: Tω = t1 if agent ω chooses
to be treated and Tω = t0 if not. Instrument Z is binary-valued (supp(Z) = {z0  z1 })
with the property 0 < P(T = t1 |Z = z0 ) < P(T = t1 |Z = z1 ) < 1. A standard example is the problem of identifying the causal effect of college education on income Y .
Agent ω decides between going to college (Tω = t1 ) or not (Tω = t0 ). Instrumental variable Z represents randomly assigned college scholarships. For example, Zω = z1 if a
scholarship is assigned to agent ω and Zω = z0 if agent ω does not receive a scholarship.
The response vector is S = [T (z0 ) T (z1 )] . Without further restrictions, S can take four
possible values described by the following response matrix:
s1

t
R= 1
t1

s2

s3

t0
t1

t1
t0

s4

t0
t0

values for T (z0 )

values for T (z1 )

(26)

In the language of LATE, the response-types s1  s2  s3  s4 are always-takers, compliers, defiers, and never-takers, respectively. Bt1 is the binary matrix that has the same dimension
as R, whose elements take value 1 if the corresponding element in R is t1 and value 0 if
the element in R is t0 . Thus, Bt1 = 1[R = t1 ] and Bt0 = 1[R = t0 ] indicate whether elements
in R are equal to t1 or t0 , respectively.28
The 4 × 4 binary matrix BT = [Bt0  Bt1 ] has rank equal to 3, which is less than the
number of response-types NS = 4. Therefore, by Corollary C-1, neither response-type
probabilities nor the counterfactual outcomes are point-identified. To identify them, it is
necessary to reduce the number of response-types.
LATE solves this non-identification problem by assuming that each agent ω can only
change his decision in one direction as the instrument varies. The monotonicity condition
of Imbens and Angrist (1994) is the following:
ASSUMPTION A-1—(Monotonicity for the Binary Choice Model): The following inequalities hold for any z z  ∈ supp(Z) :


  

1 Tω (z) = t1 ≥ 1 Tω z  = t1

  


1 Tω (z) = t1 ≤ 1 Tω z  = t1

∀ω ∈ Ω
∀ω ∈ Ω29

or

(27)

In our example, Condition A-1 assumes that each agent is inclined to decide towards
college if a scholarship is granted, that is, 1[Tω (z1 ) = t1 ] ≥ 1[Tω (z0 ) = t1 ] for all ω ∈ Ω.
This eliminates the response-type s3 (the defiers) in matrix (26), generating the following
We also have that Bt1 = ιNZ ιNS − Bt0 , where ιN denotes a N-dimensional vector of elements 1.
Imbens and Angrist (1994) did not use indicator functions. This is one innovation of our analysis. They
compared the values of the counterfactual choices directly, for example, Tω (z) ≥ Tω (z  ), assuming the T are
ordered. In their analysis, the values that choice T takes must be ordered. Our approach does not require T
to be ordered. The two monotonicity criteria are equivalent for the binary choice model.

Under monotonicity Condition A-1, the three response-type probabilities (P(s1 )
P(s2 ) P(s4 )) and the four counterfactual outcomes (E(Y (t0 )|S = s2 ) E(Y (t0 )|S =
s4 ) E(Y (t1 )|S = s1 ) E(Y (t0 )|S = s4 )) are identified. These claims can be demonstrated
by applying Theorem T-2 and Corollary C-1. For instance, the rank of the binary matrix
BT in (28) is 3, which is also the number of response-types. Thus, by Corollary C-1, all
the response probabilities P S are identified. The identification of counterfactual outcomes
depends on the properties of matrices Kt0 , Kt1 that are calculated using the pseudoinverse
matrices B+t0  B+t1 as described in (21):

Since ζ 0 Kt0 = 0 and ζ 1 Kt1 = 0, by Theorem T-2, E(Y (t0 )|S = s4 ) and E(Y (t1 )|S = s1 ) are
identified. In Section 7, we use the properties of the generalized inverse to extend our
analysis to a general model of multiple choices and extend the notion of compliers to the
general unordered choice model.
4.2. Revisiting Vytlacil’s Equivalence Theorem
A by-product of our analysis is a simple derivation of Vytlacil’s (2002) fundamental
equivalence result. He showed that monotonicity Condition A-1 holds if and only if the
treatment choice can be expressed as a function that is separable in Z and V , that is, there
exist deterministic functions, ϕ : supp(V ) → R and τ : supp(Z) → R such that


(31)
1[T = t1 |V = v Z = z] = 1 τ(z) ≥ ϕ(v) 
Monotonicity Condition A-1 generates a key property of the binary matrix Bt1 = 1[R =
t1 ]. We can always reorder its rows and columns so that Bt1 becomes a lower-triangular
matrix.30 Consider the binary choice model where T takes values in {t0  t1 } and Z takes
values in {z1      zNZ } that are indexed by increasing values of the propensity score, that is,
P(T = t1 |z1 ) ≤ · · · ≤ P(T = t1 |zNZ ). Arrange the columns of binary matrix Bt1 in decreasing order of the column-sums. Under monotonicity Condition A-1, Bt1 has dimension
30
Recall R does not have redundant rows or columns. Otherwise stated, there are no identical responsetypes and a change in the instrumental values induces a change in choice for some share of the population.

Bt1 [i n] = 1 for i ≥ n and

Bt1 [i n] = 0

for i < n

Propensity score equality (15) generates the following expressions:

The second equality uses the definition of an element in the ith row and nth column of Bt1 [i n ], that is Bt1 [i n ] = 1[T = t1 |Z = zi  S = sn ] and that NS = NZ +
1 due to monotonicity Condition A-1. The third equality uses triangularity propi

This expression captures the key idea that the response variable S summarizes V . Section 6 establishes separability properties for a general unordered choice model. The triangularity property generating separability carries over to that general setting.
5. MULTIPLE UNORDERED CHOICES
In the published literature, when LATE is extended to analyze multiple choices, T
is assumed to be a scalar index defined over an ordered finite set of natural numbers
{1     NT } where the index is monotonically increasing (or decreasing) in the indicators
of t (Angrist and Imbens (1995)). Treatment effects are defined in terms of variations in
this index:
ASSUMPTION A-2—Ordered Monotonicity: The following inequalities hold for any
z z  ∈ supp(Z), and each treatment t ∈ supp(T ):
 
 
Tω (z) ≥ Tω z  ∀ω ∈ Ω or Tω (z) ≤ Tω z  ∀ω ∈ Ω
(39)
Under standard assumptions about IV, Assumption A-2 is equivalent to the assumption that choices are generated by an ordered choice model (Vytlacil (2006)). To extend
monotonicity to the unordered case, we retain the core feature of a monotonic relationship: shifts in Z move all agents toward or against making treatment choice t in supp(T ).
We do not require any order among the values of T , nor do we rely on a scalar representation of T . Instead, we replace comparisons of T with inequalities that compare indicator
functions of the values taken by T for each pair of values z, z  in supp(Z). If the support
of T has no natural order, Assumption A-2 is meaningless.
This section extends the literature to define a concept of monotonicity for an unordered
choice model. We discuss restrictions on the response matrix R that follow from this definition. We present some examples that build intuition.
5.1. Monotonicity for Unordered Models
ASSUMPTION A-3—Unordered Monotonicity: The following inequalities hold for any
z z  ∈ supp(Z), and each treatment t ∈ supp(T ):

where 1[Tω (z) = t] indicates whether or not agent ω chooses treatment t ∈ supp(T ) when Z
is set to z.
Using indicator functions, we can make pairwise comparisons for all values of Z for
each choice t ∈ supp(T ) without imposing an arbitrary ordering on the values of the treatment choices T or creating a scalar index of T . Condition (40) preserves the key intuitive
notion of monotonicity: a shift in an instrument moves all agents uniformly toward or
against each possible choice. Assumption A-3 prohibits non-uniform movements induced
by the instruments and is ruled out in Theorem T-3 below.
In the case of binary treatment, Ordered Monotonicity Assumption A-2 and unordered monotonicity Assumption A-3 generate the same monotonicity restriction As-

sumption A-1.32 In Appendix C of the Supplemental Material, we present a simple example that demonstrates the benefits of using choice indicators rather than cardinal measures of outcomes to define monotonicity.
5.2. Linking Unordered Monotonicity to Choice Theory
Under unordered monotonicity, treatment choice can be characterized as the solution
to a problem in which agents maximize utility Ψ (t z v), the utility arising from choosing
t ∈ supp(T ) for agent ω whose unobserved variable V takes value v when the instrument
Z is set at z. We present a formal analysis of the properties of Ψ (t z v) generated by unordered monotonicity in Section 6. In this section, we build economic intuition showing
how unordered monotonicity arises. We use revealed preference arguments to restrict R
and generate monotonicity conditions. We give examples where plausible restrictions on
choice theory, coupled with standard instrumental variable conditions, produce identification of various strata counterfactuals and response-type probabilities. We also examine
cases in which the point identification of response-type probabilities fails.
Consider a model of car purchase in which each agent buys a single car from three
possible options: {a b c}. Let Tω = tj if agent ω buys car j in supp(T ) = {ta  tb  tc }. Instruments are randomly assigned car-specific vouchers that offer price discounts to the car (or
cars) specified by an offered voucher. We use za  zb  zc for vouchers that offer a discount
to cars a b, and c, respectively. We use zbc for the voucher whose discount can be used
to buy car b or c. zno denotes no discount. If the voucher assigned to agent ω is za , then
he faces a price discount if he decides to buy car a. Agent ω pays full price if he decides
to buy car b or c. If the agent were assigned voucher zbc , then the cars b and c become
cheaper while car a has full price. We compare experimental designs that randomly assign
different combinations of three out of the five voucher types described above. Each agent
ω is assumed to buy some car. In this section and in Supplemental Material Appendix D,
we give some examples of how choice restrictions facilitate identification and where they
fail.
Our main example carried throughout the rest of this paper considers vouchers in
supp(Z) = {zno  za  zbc }. The response vector S is given by the three-dimensional vector
of counterfactual choices: S = [T (zno ) T (za ) T (zbc )] . Each of the three counterfactual
choices T (z); z ∈ {zno  za  zbc } takes values in {ta  tb  tc }, which gives a total of 27 (= 33 )
possible response-types.33 Without restrictions on admissible strata, the model of stratacontingent counterfactuals is not identified.34 There are four intuitive monotonicity relationships arising from different values of z:

1 Tω (zno ) = ta ≤ 1 Tω (za ) = ta 

Heckman and Pinto (2015c) showed that in the general case of multi-valued treatments, Ordered Monotonicity A-2 and unordered monotonicity A-3 do not imply each other.
33
See Supplemental Material Appendix Table SI.
34
If we assume an ordered choice model, we can readily secure identification. If we only assume a partially
ordered model, we lose identification. Heckman and Pinto (2015c) discussed these cases.

Relationship (41) states that the agent is induced toward buying car a when the instrument
changes from no voucher (zno ) to a voucher for car a (za ). Relationship (42) states that the
agent is induced toward buying car a when the instrument changes from a voucher to buy
b or c (zbc ) to a voucher for car a (za ). Relationship (43) states that the agent is induced
toward buying either car b or c when the instrument changes from no voucher (zno ) to
a voucher for either car b or c (zbc ). Relationship (44) states that the agent is induced
toward buying either car b or c when the instrument changes from a voucher for car a
(za ) to a voucher that applies to either car b or c (zbc ). Monotonicity relationships (41)–
(44) eliminate 12 response-types out of the 27 possible ones, leaving the 15 admissible
response-types presented in Table I.35
Thus, by Corollary C-1, our model for counterfactuals is not identified. In addition,
some of the remaining strata are not consistent with unordered monotonicity Assumption A-3. More stringent application of revealed preference analysis can generate additional choice restrictions. Let Λω (z t) be the consumption set of agent ω when assigned
instrument z ∈ supp(Z) when treatment is set to t ∈ supp(T ). Let γ ∈ Λω (z t) represent
a consumption good. Agent ω is assumed to maximize a utility function uω defined over
consumption goods γ and choice t. Thus, the choice function Chω : supp(Z) → supp(T )
of agent ω when the instrument is set to value z ∈ supp(Z) is

Relationship (46) compares the budget sets of agent ω for each possible voucher assignment given the car choice is fixed at a. The budget set of agent ω is enlarged when she
has a voucher for car a (za ) compared to when she does not (za is the only voucher that
applies to car a). Thus, assigning consumer ω who buys car a, voucher za provides additional income. Vouchers zno and zbc offer no discount for car a and produce the same
budget set for this choice. Relationship (47) examines the agent’s budget set if ω purchases car b. The budget set of agent ω is enlarged if she has a voucher that subsidizes car
b when compared to vouchers that do not affect the choice set (za  zno ). Relationship (48)

examines the agent’s budget set when car c is assigned and is consistent with the budget

In particular, Choice Rule (49) applied to budget set relationships (46)–(48) generates
the choice restrictions 1–6 in Table II.
Under additional assumptions about choice, we generate additional restrictions on the
admissible strata. It is reasonable to assume that if an agent decides to buy a car without
a discount, then the agent will not alter his choice if assigned a voucher that makes his
choice of car cheaper. Specifically, consider the agent who decides between cars b and
c when the voucher assignment shifts from zno to zbc . There is no discount under zno
whereas zbc offers a discount for either car. If most of the income increase is spent on
other goods, then the agent’s car choice likely remains the same.38 Under this condition,
an income increase should not decrease the agent’s consumption of cars. If the agent is
already consuming one unit of car b and his income is increased, then the agent will not
decrease his car consumption; hence the agent still buys car b if the voucher changes
from zno to zbc .39 This restriction on choice generates the seventh choice restriction in
Table II. The choice restrictions of Table II eliminate 20 out of the 27 possible responsetypes generating the admissible response matrix in Table III.40

For the response matrix of Table III, the rank of the indicator matrix BT associated with
this response matrix is equal to 7, which is also equal to the number of response-types.
From Corollary C-1, response-type probabilities are identified. We can also identify mean
counterfactual outcomes defined in terms of the strata in the table. The response matrix
of Table III is generated by the nine unordered monotonicity relationships of Table IV.41
The choice restrictions generated by the revealed preference analysis in Table II produce
unordered monotonicity Assumption A-3.
REMARK 5.1: The response matrix in Table III is uniquely generated by the unordered
monotonicity relationships of Table IV. By uniquely we mean that a change in the direction of any of these inequalities produces a response matrix that differs from the one in
Table III. This property is useful for testing the model assumptions, as each monotonicity
relationship implies a propensity score inequality that can be tested on observed data.
Unordered monotonicity can arise under different configurations of the instrumental
variable. Thus, in the previous example, consider changing the support of the instrumental
variable Z from {zno  za  zbc } to {zno  zb  zbc }. We can apply the same revealed preference
analysis of the first example to {zno  zb  zbc }. This analysis generates the response matrix
shown in Table V, which is also uniquely generated by nine inequalities consistent with
unordered monotonicity Assumption A-3. The response matrix also identifies responsetype probabilities and an associated set of counterfactual outcomes. However, three out
of seven response-types in Table V differ from the ones in Table III.
Choice restrictions alone do not necessarily produce identifiability. For an example,
see Supplemental Material Appendix D.2. We further note that unordered monotonicity Assumption A-3 is not a necessary condition for identification of model parameters.
In Supplemental Material Appendix D.3, we modify the example of Table V by assuming that Z takes values in supp(Z) = {zc  zb  zbc }. WARP alone generates the response
matrix described in Table VI.42 The rank of its associated binary matrix BT is equal to 7.
Thus, response-type probabilities are identified. However, the response matrix in Table VI
is not consistent with unordered monotonicity Assumption A-3. There is no sequence of
monotonic relationships consistent with Assumption A-3 that generates this response matrix. For example, consider the change in voucher assignment from voucher for c (zc ) to

or may not identify the choice model, depending on the patterns of restrictions imposed
on the variation in the instruments.44
6. EQUIVALENT CONDITIONS FOR CHARACTERIZING UNORDERED MONOTONICITY
This section presents and interprets general properties shared by all response matrices
that satisfy unordered monotonicity Assumption A-3. We explore a variety of ways to
express Assumption A-3 including separability of choice equations.
6.1. Properties of Binary Matrices
To establish a relationship between identifiability and the properties of response matrix
R, it is helpful to use concepts from the literature on binary matrices. A binary matrix
is lonesum if it is uniquely determined by its row and column sums.45 We establish that
response matrix R is an unordered monotone response matrix (henceforth “monotone”)
if each binary matrix derived from it, Bt = 1[R = t]; t ∈ supp(T ), is lonesum. Lonesum
matrices can be used to characterize monotonicity conditions in choice models. We show
that identification and equivalence results arise from the properties of lonesum matrices.

Let rit be the ith row sum of the binary matrix Bt : rit = n=1
Bt [i n]. Let cnt denote
NZ
the sum of the nth column of Bt , that is, cnt = i=1 Bt [i n]. The maximal of matrix Bt is a
matrix whose ith row is given by rit elements 1 followed by 0’s. Two matrices are equivalent
if one can be transformed into the other by a series of row and/or column permutations.
Table VII displays matrix Bta = 1[R = ta ], where R is the response matrix of Table III.
The first column of Table VII gives the row sums of Bta . The last row of Table VII presents
its column sums. To show that matrix Bta is lonesum, reorder its columns and rows based
on decreasing values of column sums and increasing values of row sums. The maximal
of Bta is obtained by a reordering of Bta based only on row and column sums. Note that
there are different orderings for different t. The reordered matrix of Table III is given
in Table VIII. It is a maximal matrix because the matrix rows are described by elements
1 followed by 0’s. For example, if a maximal matrix has seven columns and its first row
sum is 1, the first row is [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]. Thus, a maximal matrix is uniquely determined
by its row sums. Therefore, we conclude that Bta is a lonesum matrix. One can check that
matrices Btb and Btc of Table III are also lonesum. Thus, following our definition, response
matrix R of Table III is unordered monotone. In our analysis of LATE in Section 4.1, Bt1
and Bt0 are both lonesum.

THEOREM T-3: The following statements are equivalent characterizations of Assumption A-3 for the IV model (1)–(3):

Q.E.D.

PROOF: See Supplemental Material Appendix A.6.

Condition (i) states our main condition for equivalence: if and only if response matrix
R is unordered monotone, each indicator matrix formed from it (Bt = 1[R = t]) is lonesum, and conversely. Condition (ii) states that if R is an unordered monotone response
matrix, each 2 × 2 sub-matrix in R is not of the form in (50). Condition (iii) states that the
conditions preceding it hold if and only if unordered monotonicity Assumption A-3 holds.
As previously noted, Condition (iii) implies monotonicity Assumption A-1 for the binary
choice model. Condition (iv) is a separability property that characterizes the choice functions. Vytlacil’s equivalence theorem (2002) is generated by the equivalence of conditions
(iii) and (iv) when we specialize the model to the case of a binary treatment.47
6.3. Interpreting Theorem T-3
Condition (i) describes a key property of response matrices: the lonesum property of
treatment choice indicators. Lonesum matrices are not only useful for characterizing unordered monotonicity, but they are key concepts for investigating properties of choice
models.48
Condition (i) of Theorem T-3 implies that Bt is fully characterized by its column and
row sums. This condition implies that the response matrix R is also characterized by its
row and column sums. However, the reverse is not true. We illustrate this in Remark 6.1:
46

Alternatively, this can be written as: for any z z  ∈ supp(Z) and t ∈ supp(T ), we have that
1[T = t|Z = z V = v] ≥ 1[T = t|Z = z   V = v]


1[T = t|Z = z V = v] ≤ 1[T = t|Z = z  V = v]
47

for all v ∈ supp(V ) or
for all v ∈ supp(V ).

See Supplemental Material Appendix E for a derivation.
Heckman and Pinto (2015c) showed that lonesum matrices also play a key role in equivalence results
for ordered monotonicity. Pinto (2016b) developed a framework for the design of social interventions using
lonesum matrices that rely on revealed preference relationships to identify causal parameters. He showed that
incentive designs based on lonesum matrices generate a range of monotonicity conditions.

UNORDERED MONOTONICITY

REMARK 6.1: If R is an unordered monotone response, each matrix Bt is lonesum
and therefore fully characterized by its column and row sums rit  cnt ; t ∈ supp(T ) i ∈
{1     NZ } n ∈ {1     NS }. Since response matrix R can be written as R = t∈supp(T ) tBt ,
R is characterized by its column and row sums rit  cnt as well. However, the reverse is
not true. R being characterized by its column and row sums does not imply that R is an
unordered monotone response. To illustrate this claim, let response matrix R be defined

R is not unordered monotone because it violates Condition (ii) of Theorem T-3. Moreover Bt2 = 1[R = t2 ] exhibits one of the prohibited patterns (52) and it is not lonesum.
Nevertheless, R is fully characterized by its column sums and row sums: r1t1 = 1 and c1t1 =
1 ⇒ R[1 1] = t1 ; r2t3 = 1 and c2t3 = 1 ⇒ R[2 2] = t3 ; r1t2 = 1 and R[1 1] = t1 ⇒ R[1 2] =
t2 ; r2t2 = 1 and R[2 2] = t3 ⇒ R[2 1] = t2 .
All response matrices for the case of binary treatment are equivalent under monotonicity Assumption A-1. This property does not hold for the general unordered case:
REMARK 6.2: Consider the binary choice model in which the instrument takes NZ values and T takes values in {0 1}. Unordered monotonicity generates a monotonicity inequality for each pair of Z-values. Different sets of inequalities generate different response matrices. However, each of these response matrices is equivalent to the same
lower-triangular binary matrix with NZ rows and NZ + 1 columns (see the example in
Section 4.1) and produces an identified model. However, in the case of multiple choices,
unordered monotonicity does not generate response matrices that are equivalent to the
same matrix. For example, the response matrices of Tables III and V are monotone responses but they are not equivalent, because one matrix cannot be transformed into another by row and/or column permutations. The response matrices in Tables III and V consist of seven response-types for NT = 3 and NZ = 3. There are 27 possible response-types
for NT = 3 and NZ = 3. The combination of seven response-types out of these 27 generates 888,030 possible response matrices, although some may not be identifiable. Among
them, 66 response matrices satisfy unordered monotonicity Condition (iii).49 Response
matrices of Tables III and V are two examples of these matrices.
Condition (ii) of Theorem T-3 imposes a restriction on counterfactual choices that does
not depend on the number of treatment choices in supp(T ) or the number of values that
Z takes. The condition rules out two-way flows generated by changes in instruments.
Thus, the response matrix of Table VI is not unordered monotone. The forbidden type
of condition (ii) is obtained using the first and second rows of response-types s2 and s4 in
Table VI.50 The change from zc to zb shifts people away from a in s2 but toward a in s4 .
49
Supplemental Material Appendix F presents all of the 66 response matrices that consist of distinct sets of
seven response-types generated by unordered monotonicity Assumption A-3.

REMARK 6.3: We note that a consequence of Condition (ii) in Theorem T-3 is that

Unordered monotonicity Assumption A-3 holds if and only if no prohibited patterns (52) occur for any Bt ; t ∈ supp(T ). An example clarifies the equivalence between
the requirements for unordered monotonicity Assumption A-3 and the absence of prohibited patterns (52). Suppose that (1[T = t]|Z = z V = v) ≥ (1[T = t]|Z = z   V = v)
holds for all v ∈ supp(V ). Then it must be the case that
1[T = t|Z = z S = s] ≥ 1[T = t|Z = z   S = s]

holds for all s ∈ supp(S) because, for each v ∈ supp(V ), there is s ∈ supp(S) such that
s = fS (v) (see (10)) and (T |S = s Z = z) = (T |V = v Z = z). Inequality (53) generates
three possible sub-vectors of dimension 2 × 1 that indicate whether T is equal to t when
Z takes value z and z  or any response-type s ∈ supp(S):

1[T = t|Z = z   V = v] ∀v ∈ supp(V ) implies that Bt is lonesum. On the other hand, suppose that v v ∈ supp(V ) are such that 1[T = t|Z = z V = v] > 1[T = t|Z = z   V = v]
and 1[T = t|Z = z V = v ] < 1[T = t|Z = z   V = v ]. Then there must exist s s ∈

The equality of the first columns in the right and left side of Equation (55) means that, for
some type s, treatment t is chosen when the instrument shifts from z  to z. The equality of
the second columns of Equation (55) states the opposite. For some type s , the instrument
shift from z  to z causes treatment t not to be chosen. This behavior violates both the
intuitive notion and formal definition of monotonicity because the instrument shifts some
agents to change their choice towards t while others change their choice away from t.52
51

These are termed “prohibited” or “forbidden” patterns of binary matrices (see Ryser (1957)).
Violation of Condition (ii) is not necessarily a violation of rationality. Table VI is based on an application
of WARP, but violates Condition (ii) and unordered monotonicity.

6.4. Understanding Condition (iv) of Theorem T-3
We draw on and generalize the binary-treatment model of Sections 4.1–4.2 to build the
intuition underlying Condition (iv). In the binary case, monotonicity implies that Bt1 is
lower-triangular (28).53 Triangularity generates Equation (38) which expresses treatment
choice T as an indicator function that is separable in the observed propensity score P(T =
t1 |Z), which depends on Z, and a sum of response-type probabilities, which depends on V .
Theorem T-3 applies to choice models with multiple treatments, which include the binary case. If unordered monotonicity (Condition (iii) of Theorem T-3) holds, then each
binary matrix Bt ; t ∈ supp(T ) is characterized solely by its row and column sums so that
Bt ; t ∈ supp(T ) are lonesum (item (i) of Theorem T-3). This property can be understood
as a generalization of the lower-triangular property in the binary case, but applied to
each Bt .54 Generalized triangularity generates Condition (iv) which characterizes treatment choice as an indicator function that is separable in Z and V . We present a detailed
discussion of this condition in Appendix G of the Supplemental Material.
To interpret separability condition (iv), suppose that agent ω with V ω = v ∈ supp(V )
chooses t ∈ supp(T ) when an instrumental variable is set to z ∈ supp(Z), so that 1[T =
t|V = v Z = z] = 1. According to Condition (iv), there exist functions ϕ and τ such that
ϕ(v t) + τ(z t) ≥ 0.55 It is clear that expressions of this type rule out the prohibited
patterns (52) and therefore generate unordered monotonicity. What is less obvious is
that (iii) implies representation (iv), which is not necessarily unique.56
Note that 1[T = t|V = v Z = z] = 1 implies that 1[T = t  |V = v Z = z] = 0 for all

t ∈ supp(T ) \ {t}. Therefore, it must be the case that ϕ(v t  ) + τ(z t  ) < 0 for all t  that
differs from t. In particular, Condition (iv) implies that

where m is any strictly increasing function.
Condition (iv) does not impose rationality or perfect foresight on agent decision making. Suppose that agent ω decides among t1  t2  t3 and that his treatment choice is generated by maximization of a utility function Ψ (t z v) where V ω = v and Zω = z. Condition

Consider a binary choice model: T = 1[α + V · Z ≥ 0] T ∈ {0 1} where (α V ) is a random vector and
V , Z, and α are scalar. Suppose that we impose the requirement that V > 0 while Z is unrestricted. This
is a monotone response model that is nonseparable. However, it can be represented as a separable model:
T = 1[ Vα + Z ≥ 0]. This illustrates the non-uniqueness of the representation of Ψ (t Z V ) and that separability
is only one characterization of preferences consistent with Assumption A-3.

value Ψ (t z v) can be characterized as arising from the maximization of a separable function ϕ(v t)+τ(z t). Specifically, if ω chooses t1 , then t1 is the maximum among Ψ (t z v)
for t ∈ {t1  t2  t3 }. In this case, t1 also maximizes ϕ(v t) + τ(z t) for t ∈ {t1  t2  t3 }:

t∈{t1 t2 t3 }

Condition (iv) does not imply that the ranking of treatment utilities generated by
Ψ (t z v) is necessarily the same as the ranking generated by ϕ(v t) + τ(z t). For instance, if Ψ (t1  z v) > Ψ (t2  z v) > Ψ (t3  z v), then ω prefers t1 to t2 , and t2 to t3 . This
does not necessarily imply that ϕ(v t1 ) + τ(z t1 ) > ϕ(v t2 ) + τ(z t2 ) > ϕ(v t3 ) + τ(z t3 ).
Indeed, ϕ(v t1 ) + τ(z t1 ) > ϕ(v t3 ) + τ(z t3 ) > ϕ(v t2 ) + τ(z t2 ) may also occur. It is the
ranking of t1 relative to the next best that generates agent choices of t1 . Variation in instruments only identifies preferences relative to the next best choice and not an order
among the remaining elements in the choice set.
To formalize this discussion, we establish that unordered monotonicity arises if we assume that utilities of a choice compared to the next best choice can be represented as
additively separable functions57

⇒ unordered monotonicity
Heckman, Urzúa, and Vytlacil (2006, 2008) assumed separability in the underlying
choice indices and showed that IV estimates a LATE that compares the outcome of
one choice to the outcome for the next best option. Our condition is weaker. Theorem T-4 states that unordered monotonicity only requires that the utility of a choice
relative to the next best choice be separable. To clarify, the impact of instrument Z on
the treatment choice is summarized by the term h(z t). Suppose Z changes from z 
to z. If h(z t) − h(z   t) > 0, each agent is induced towards t. If h(z t) − h(z   t) < 0,
agents are induced against t. This analysis applies for all pairwise values of (z z  ) ∈
supp(Z) × supp(Z) and for all t ∈ supp(T ). The collection of all of these inequalities
characterizes unordered monotonicity Assumption A-3.
6.5. Verifying Unordered Monotonicity Condition A-3
Verifying condition (ii) of Theorem T-3 is a daunting combinatorial task. It would require checking each 2 × 2 sub-matrix in R, which is impractical for large R. We show that
a single calculation based on a simple multiplication of binary matrices suffices to check
condition A-3. Our criterion is based on a binary matrix M :
For each tj ∈ supp(T ) = {t1      tNT }
let M tj = [1NZ NS      1NZ NS  Btj  0NZ NS      0NZ NS ]

where 1NZ NS is a matrix of elements 1 and 0NZ NS is a matrix of elements 0 of same dimension. Matrix M is block diagonal with matrices Bt on the diagonal, where, again, we
eliminate any redundancies. M has elements 1 below this diagonal and elements 0 above
it.
THEOREM T-5: For the IV model (1)–(3), the response matrix R is an unordered monotone response, that is, each binary matrix Bt = 1[R = t]; t ∈ supp(T ) is lonesum, if and only

PROOF: See Supplemental Material Appendix A.8.

Q.E.D.

Unordered monotonicity condition A-3 holds if and only if this value is equal to zero.
Moreover, if Equation (58) holds, then all the conditions stated in Theorem T-3 also hold.

7. IDENTIFICATION OF COUNTERFACTUALS AND TREATMENT EFFECTS
This section applies our analysis to determine which counterfactuals and treatment effects are identified and for which strata. We build on our analysis of binary LATE presented in Section 4.1. We generalize the notions of “compliers,” “always takers,” and
“never-takers” to a general unordered choice model.
To this end, it is helpful to introduce some additional notation. Let Σt (i) be the set of
response-types in which t appears exactly i times:


NZ

  
Σt (i) = sn  such that sn ∈ supp(S) and
Bt j  n = i
j  =1

where i ∈ {0     NZ }

(59)

For example, Σta (2) for the response matrix of Table III consists of the response-types for
which the value ta appears exactly twice. They are Σta (2) = {s2  s3 } (see Table IX). Those
are also the response-types whose column-sum of Bta in Table VII is 2.
For each t ∈ supp(T ), we can partition the set of response-types by the number of
N
times a treatment value t appears: supp(S) = i=0Z Σt (i). Table IX displays these partitions
for Σta (i); i = 0     3 based on the response matrix in Table III. Let bt (i) be the NS dimensional binary row-vector that indicates if response-type s belongs to Σt (i), that is,
bt (i)[n] = 1 if sn ∈ Σt (i) and zero otherwise. For Table III, bta (2) = [0 1 1 0 0 0 0].
Using this notation, we prove the following identification theorem:
THEOREM T-6: If unordered monotonicity Assumption A-3 holds for the IV model (1)–
(3), then the following response-type probabilities and counterfactuals are identified:





P S ∈ Σt (i) and E κ Y (t) |S ∈ Σt (i) ∀t ∈ supp(T ) and i ∈ {1     NZ } (60)

Q.E.D.

Note that, in general, we cannot identify counterfactuals within every stratum. Nonetheless, it can be shown that under unordered monotonicity, at least one treatment effect can
always be identified.58
Table X lists the mean counterfactual outcomes that are identified by applying Equation (60) of Theorem T-6 to the response matrix R in Table IX. Those are E(Y (t)|S ∈
Σt (i)) for i ∈ {1 2 3} and t ∈ {ta  tb  tc }.
REMARK 7.1: A direct implication of Theorem T-6 is that if there exist t t  ∈ supp(T )
and i i ∈ {1     NZ } such that Σt (i) = Σt  (i ), then E(Y (t) − Y (t  )|Σt (i)) is identified.
This expression is the mean treatment effect of t relative to t  for the set of strata Σt (i).
Expression (61) uses the tools for identification based on the generalized inverse developed in Section 4. For instance, we can apply Equation (61) of Theorem T-6 to generate
the following identifying relationships:


E Y (ta )|S ∈ {s2  s3 }

 bt (1)B+t QZ (ta )

E Y · 1[T = ta ]|Z = zno − E Y · 1[T = ta ]|Z = zbc
=

P(T = ta |Z = zno ) − P(T = ta |Z = zbc )

(62)

See Supplemental Material Appendix A.10 for the derivation of Equation (62). Counterfactuals E(Y (tb )|S = s2 ) and E(Y (tc )|S = s3 ) are also identified (see Table X). Thus we
can identify the effect:




E Y (ta ) − Y (tb )|S = s2 P(S = s2 ) + E Y (ta ) − Y (tc )|S = s3 P(S = s3 )

(63)
P(S = s2 ) + P(S = s3 )
Let ta designate the choice values other than ta . We use the notation E(Y (ta ) − Y (ta )|S ∈
{s2  s3 }) to designate treatment effect (63), which stands for the effect of choosing ta versus
58

In particular, one can always identify the treatment effect of tj vs the next best. See below. In general,
a richer class of treatment effects can be identified in the unordered model than in the ordered or binary
models. See Heckman and Pinto (2016).

its derivation.)
We generalize the terminology of Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin (1996) to the case of multiple possible outcomes. The appropriate generalization is t-specific. In the binary case,
there is no need to specify a particular t since the specification of one value automatically
implies the other possible value. The t-Never-takers are those in the set of response-types
in Σt (0) for which t does not occur. Σt (NZ ) consists of a single response-type whose elements are all t. It is the set of the t-Always-takers. The set of remaining response-types are
N −1
t-Switchers ≡ i=1Z Σt (i) consists of all strata for which the choice of treatment t varies
as Z ranges in its support.59 Those sets are formally defined as

t-Never-takers = s ∈ supp(S); P(T = t|S = s) = 0 ≡ Σt (0);

t-Always-takers = s ∈ supp(S); P(T = t|S = s) = 1 ≡ Σt (NZ );

Corollary C-2 relies on the result in Theorem T-6 that P(S ∈ Σt (i)) is identified for
all i ∈ {1     NZ }. Corollary C-3 is obtained by setting κ(Y ) = Y and using the fact that
E(κ(Y (t))|S ∈ Σt (i)) is identified for all i ∈ {1     NZ }. To illustrate these corollaries we
present the following example.
REMARK 7.2: Corollary C-2 states that the expected value of counterfactual mean outcomes for response-types s ∈ supp(S) such that P(T = t|S = s) = 1 (the t-Always-takers)
or 0 < P(T = t|S = s) < 1 (t-Switchers) are identified. According to Remark 3.1, these
response-types refer to the values v ∈ supp(V ) such that 0 < P(T = t|V = v) ≤ 1. Therefore, Corollary C-3 implies that E(Y (t)|V ∈ {v; 0 < P(T = t|V = v) ≤ 1}) is identified.
The remaining set of response-types is the t-Never-takers, which consist of the responsetypes s ∈ supp(S) such that P(T = t|S = s) = 0. This set refers to the set of values
v ∈ supp(V ) such that P(T = t|V = v) = 0. If the set of t-Never-takers is empty, then
all response-types belong to either t-Always-takers or t-Switchers and E(Y (t)) is identified.

Supplemental Material Appendix A.17 presents additional results on identification.
Supplemental Material Appendix A.21 shows that E(Y (ta ) − Y (ta )|ta -Switchers) is also
identified. In contrast with the binary case, there is no response-type s ∈ {s1      s7 } of
response matrix R in Table III such that E(Y (t) − Y (t  )|S = s) is identified for any
t t  ∈ {ta  tb  tc }, t = t  .
It is important to distinguish identification of counterfactuals within sets of strata from
the identification of treatment effects within sets of strata. An example is helpful. Consider the response matrix for a two-valued instrument with three treatment choices under
unordered monotonicity. It has five response-types:
s1 s2 s3 s4 s5


t t t t t
R= 1 1 2 3 3 

Five counterfactual mean outcomes are identified: E(Y (t1 )|S = s1 ) E(Y (t1 )|S =
s2 ) E(Y (t2 )|S = s3 ) E(Y (t3 )|S = s4 ) E(Y (t3 )|S = s5 ). E(Y (t2 ) − Y (t̄2 )|t̄2 -Switchers) is
identified. This is the treatment effect of t2 versus the next best treatment, which may vary
among members of the t2 switchers.60
7.1. Maximum Number of Admissible Response-Types to Secure Identification
The identification of strata probabilities P(S = s); s ∈ supp(S) can be achieved under weaker conditions than are required for identifying counterfactual outcomes. The
identification of response-type probabilities depends on the column-rank of BT , while
the identification of counterfactual outcomes for a choice t ∈ supp(T ) depends on the
column-rank of Bt . The rank of BT is always greater than the rank of each Bt ; t ∈ supp(T )
because BT is generated by stacking Bt across t ∈ supp(T ) (Equation (24)).
60
This analysis readily generalizes to any columns of switchers. This treatment effect can always be identified
under the assumption of unordered monotonicity. Treatment effects for other categories of switchers can also
be identified under these conditions. Additional treatment effects can sometimes be identified. See Heckman
and Pinto (2016).

UNORDERED MONOTONICITY

We characterize the maximum number of response-types NS in R that facilitate the
identification of all response-type probabilities, that is, the maximum NS such that NS ≤
rank(BT ).
THEOREM T-7: Consider the IV model (1)–(3). Let R be the response matrix consisting of
NS response-types. If response-type probabilities are point-identified, then it must be the case
that

where NZ is the number of possible values that the instrument takes and NT is the number of
possible values that the treatment choice T takes. In particular, if P(T = t|Z = z) > 0 for all
z ∈ supp(Z) and t ∈ supp(T ), then the maximum number of response-types NS in R for the
model to be identified is
NS = 1 + (NT − 1)NZ 
PROOF: See Supplemental Material Appendix A.13.

Q.E.D.

To identify choice-response probabilities, choice restrictions should eliminate at least
N − [1 + (NT − 1)NZ ] response-types to generate identification of response-type probabilities. Theorem T-6 shows that even if we are not able to identify each probability P(S =
s); s ∈ supp(S), it may still be possible to identify counterfactual means E(Y (t)|S ∈ Σt (i))
and associated probabilities P(S ∈ Σt (i)) for strata Σt (i). See Supplemental Material Appendix A.14 for additional results on identification of strata probabilities.

8. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
This paper extends the literature on instrumental variables to general unordered choice
models with heterogeneous responses that affect choice. We generalize the notion of
monotonicity to unordered choice models. Using discrete instruments, we present conditions under which certain counterfactuals and treatment effects associated with general
unordered multiple discrete choice models can be identified. We demonstrate how to
characterize the set of identified counterfactuals and treatment effects.
We represent IV equations using discrete mixtures. Identification is achieved by imposing restrictions on the kernels of the mixtures. We do not invoke separability of preferences or identification at infinity to achieve these results. Nonetheless, separability of
choice equations emerges as one representation of the underlying choice process.
Unordered monotonicity can sometimes be justified by economic choice models. It can
be represented in multiple ways. Unordered monotonicity implies and is implied by a form
of separability in the equations generating choices. These representations are linked to
properties of binary matrices that characterize the admissible response-types generated
by the available instrumental variables. We develop a variety of criteria to determine if
Unordered Monotonicity is satisfied. We interpret each of these criteria and explain how
they can be used in practice. We show that “principal strata” in the statistics literature are
coarse versions of control functions.
This paper demonstrates the power of binary matrices in generating and interpreting
identification conditions and in unifying apparently diverse approaches to identification of
mean counterfactuals and mean treatment effects. The broader lesson of this paper is that

in general unordered discrete choice models, restrictions on choice behavior, encoded
in the kernel of the mixture representing the IV equations, play a fundamental role in
identifying counterfactuals using instrumental variables.
