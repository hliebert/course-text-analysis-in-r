Selection due to survival or attrition might bias estimates of racial disparities in health, but few studies quantify the likely
magnitude of such bias. In a large national cohort with moderate loss to follow-up, we contrasted racial differences in 2
stroke risk factors, incident hypertension and incident left ventricular hypertrophy, estimated by complete-case analyses,
inverse probability of attrition weighting, and the survivor average causal effect. We used data on 12,497 black and
17,660 white participants enrolled in the United States (2003–2007) and collected incident risk factor data approximately
10 years after baseline. At follow-up, 21.0% of white participants and 23.0% of black participants had died; additionally
22.0% of white participants and 28.4% of black participants had withdrawn. Individual probabilities of completing the
follow-up visit were estimated using baseline demographic and health characteristics. Adjusted risk ratio estimates of
racial disparities from complete-case analyses in both incident hypertension (1.11, 95% conﬁdence interval: 1.02, 1.21)
and incident left ventricular hypertrophy (1.02, 95% conﬁdence interval: 0.84, 1.24) were virtually identical to estimates
from inverse probability of attrition weighting and survivor average causal effect. Despite racial differences in mortality
and attrition, we found little evidence of selection bias in the estimation of racial differences for these incident risk factors.

the follow-up period both potentially introduce bias in
estimation of exposure-outcome relationships.
While recent epidemiologic work has advanced knowledge
of disease etiology, racial disparities in disease risk persist, and
these disparities are marked with respect to stroke and hypertension (7–9). Racial differences in mortality (10–12) imply potential selection bias by race in longitudinal studies. Speciﬁcally,
estimation of racial disparities in incident disease might be subject to bias if the missingness mechanism disproportionately affects one racial group through selective survival and attrition
(13). Simulation studies have shown that this bias can be large
in apparently plausible scenarios (13) but only if selection probability is determined by a nonmultiplicative interaction between
race and other risk factors for the outcome. To date, there is

In epidemiologic studies assessing incident disease development, traditional statistical analyses are performed only for those
participants with disease measurement at follow-up visits (i.e.,
completers), necessarily excluding those participants lost to attrition (1). However, this approach can introduce bias if the causal
effect in participants excluded is inherently different from the
effect among participants included in the analyses (i.e., in the
context of treatment effect heterogeneity) or if the selection
process is inﬂuenced by the exposure of interest and another
predictor of disease (i.e., in the context of collider bias) (1–4).
This selection bias can be a particular issue in longitudinal cohort
studies, where the likelihood of attrition increases over time (5).
Although death is fundamentally different from standard missing
outcome scenarios (6), study withdrawal and death over

Differences in Stroke, United States, 2003–2016. This graph represents
the assumptions that a set of covariates L (age, sex, and region) are
determined concurrently with race and might be associated due to an
unspeciﬁed common prior cause (represented by the double-headed
arrow), and a set of covariates C (education, income, self-reported health,
smoking status, relationship status, health insurance, alcohol use, body
mass index category, exercise frequency, rurality, neighborhood socioeconomic score, aspirin use, atrial ﬁbrillation, history of coronary artery
disease, history of myocardial infarction, history of transient ischemic
attack, diabetes status at baseline, systolic blood pressure, diastolic
blood pressure, and R wave aVL), which are potentially inﬂuenced
by race, inﬂuence both attrition and incident stroke risk factors (our
outcome of interest). Additionally, race might have a direct effect on
attrition. The substantive question of interest in the analysis is the
effect of race on incident stroke risk factors. The box around attrition
indicates that all analyses are by necessity conditioned on this variable. In the sample of individuals who completed the second visit,
race might be spuriously associated with L or C due to selective survival or withdrawal. Because race inﬂuences incident stroke risk factors in part via covariates C, analyses conditioned on C would not
estimate the total effect of race on incident stroke risk factors.

METHODS
Study population

The Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke
(REGARDS) cohort is a national, population-based study of
30,239 community-dwelling participants from the contiguous
United States who self-identiﬁed as non-Hispanic black or white,
with oversampling from the southeastern Stroke Belt and among
black persons; the study design and objectives are described in
more detail elsewhere (21). Participants were recruited between
2003 and 2007, with inclusion of those age 45 years or older,
using commercially available contact information. At enrollment, participants completed detailed surveys and clinical
measures, collected via phone and in-home visits performed
by technicians trained to the study protocol (21). The study
team continues to contact each participant or designated proxy
every 6 months by phone for information about stroke events,
stroke symptoms, hospitalizations, and death. The study
team regularly uses the National Death Index to assess
whether participants have died without being detected
through regular contact. These brief regular communications
allow for time-to-event analysis of adjudicated outcomes such as
death, stroke, and coronary heart disease events (22–24), but
assessment of many stroke risk factors requires physical examination. Therefore, a second in-person examination of the

limited empirical evidence from real cohorts on whether
such scenarios are likely to occur.
One approach used to address potential selection bias due
to study attrition is inverse probability of attrition weighting
(IPAW), where participants with follow-up data (which we
refer to as “complete case”) are weighted to reﬂect the original
baseline population or another population of interest (2, 14).
This approach estimates the probability of attrition before followup measurement using all cohort participants. Inverses of these
attrition probabilities are then applied in analyses of completely
observed participants, a process that up-weights complete participant proﬁles that are underrepresented in observed follow-up
data and down-weights those that are overrepresented in the
observed data (2, 14). This approach can incorporate multiple
reasons for attrition, such as death and withdrawal during followup. The ability to consider these different attrition processes provides great ﬂexibility, given that baseline factors associated with
death and associated with withdrawal might differ substantially
(15). Once probabilities of attrition for each reason have been
estimated, they can be multiplied to provide an overall estimated
probability of observation, (that is, probability of no attrition)
(15). The IPAW estimate can be interpreted as the effect estimate
that would have been observed had the cohort not experienced
attrition (2, 14, 15). An alternative interpretation is that weighting
recreates the distribution of covariates to mirror the original population and thereby corrects spurious associations that might
have been introduced by the selection process (15).
IPAW reﬂecting no attrition compared with the baseline population has been criticized because the outcome value for people
who did not survive to follow-up assessment is undeﬁned, so it is
argued that estimating treatment effect in people who died is conceptually incoherent (6, 16–18). The survivor average causal
effect (SACE) provides an appealing alternative. Distinct from
the IPAW analytical approach, SACE is interpreted as the exposure effect among participants who would be complete cases
regardless of factors for which the selection bias occurs (6).
One calculation of SACE employs the estimated probability of
attrition as an additional covariate in the analytical model of
interest, conveniently providing a test for the null hypothesis
of no selection bias (6).
We are interested in estimation of racial disparities for incident
stroke risk factors, and how selection bias might affect these estimates. Our conceptual diagram (Figure 1) reﬂects how attrition
could bias racial disparity estimates; here L are covariates not
plausibly affected by race, and C are covariates that might inﬂuence selection and are potential consequences of race. Therefore,
we used both IPAW and SACE methodologies to account for
potential selection bias in a large cohort study and compared these
with results from uncorrected analyses based only on respondents
who completed the follow-up visit. Our goal was to assess
whether either of these sophisticated methods to address
selection bias substantially alters apparent racial differences in stroke risk factors. We selected 2 stroke risk factors with differing likely impact: hypertension and left ventricular
hypertrophy (LVH). Hypertension was selected because it is a
common risk factor anticipated to have a small impact on the risk
of death during follow-up (individuals can live years with hypertension). LVH was selected because it is a less common risk factor,
but the potential impact of LVH on the risk of death during
follow-up could be large (19, 20).

Selection Bias Investigation: REGARDS Study 3

Outcome assessment

As important stroke risk factors, 2 cardiovascular outcomes of
interest are incident hypertension and incident LVH. Hypertension was assessed at both baseline and follow-up visits and is
deﬁned as either self-reported use of medication to control blood
pressure or measured systolic blood pressure of ≥140 mm Hg or
diastolic blood pressure of ≥90 mm Hg; blood pressure was the
mean of 2 manual measures taken after the participant had been
seated for 5 minutes. LVH was deﬁned using the Sokolow-Lyon
criteria from electrocardiogram performed at both visits (28).
Incident hypertension and LVH were deﬁned as presence of
the risk factor at follow-up among participants without the risk
factor at baseline.

Statistical analysis

Through IPAW, weights are used to create a pseudopopulation, a hypothetical cohort had the attrition not occurred. We
performed IPAW analysis relative to 2 pseudopopulations of
interest: 1) all REGARDS participants who were not known
to be deceased by the time of the expected 10-year follow-up;
and 2) all analyzed REGARDS participants. These 2 populations, respectively, represent the REGARDS cohort, assuming
either 1) no study withdrawal or 2) both no study withdrawal and
no death. Both pseudopopulations were used because we
are investigating the potential impact that selection bias from
either death or withdrawal might have in estimating racial disparities in incident risk factors in REGARDS, particularly if
race is strongly associated with either attrition mechanism.
All participants were coded to indicate a completed followup visit (complete case), study withdrawal, or death. The probabilities of no attrition were predicted through logistic regression
models using baseline participant characteristics. Speciﬁcally,
P (Si = 0) = P (Di = 0, Wi = 0)
=P (Di = 0) P (Wi = 0|Di = 0)

(1 )

where Si, Wi, and Di are indicators of attrition, withdrawal,
and death for the ith participant.
Because we are not willing to assume that survival and
withdrawal are inﬂuenced by the same factors, we modeled
P(Di = 0) and P(Wi = 0| Di = 0) separately. Speciﬁcally,

Logit (P (Di = 0|Racei , L i , Ci )
= αD + β D I (Racei = black)
+ θ DL i + γDCi + δ D Ci *

(2a)

Logit (P (Wi = 0|Racei , L i , Ci , Di = 0)
= αW + β W I (Racei = black)
+ θ W L i + γW Ci + δ W Ci * ,

(2b)

where Li are predictors of attrition not plausibly affected by
race, Ci predictors of attrition that occurred later in life and
might be inﬂuenced by race (Figure 1), and Ci* includes all
pairwise interactions between race, Li, and Ci. The quantities
α, β, θ, γ, and δ and accompanying subscripts W and D in
equation 2 reﬂect the distinct model parameters for withdrawal and death models.
See Table 1 for the list of covariates considered and the coding of each as modeled. Assumed to occur concurrent with
assessment of race and potentially confound effect estimation,
we deﬁne L to include age, sex, and region. The additional variables are included in C, which are assumed to be potentially
inﬂuenced by race and therefore not confounders of race. Sensitivity analyses additionally included cognitive function (Six-Item
Screener score of ≥4) on the subset of participants with measurement at baseline data collection (29).
Because we examined age continuously, up to a cubic term
of age was included in each predictive model for increased
weight model ﬁt. Each weight model was examined using
Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-ﬁt χ2 test (30) and Hinkley’s
method of assessing link function appropriateness (1, 31). Given
that the attrition mechanism should be a function of variables
related to both exposure and outcome for selection bias to be
present, we selected predictors measured at baseline that are
thought to be related to race or incident risk factor and maximize
model predictive ability, measured through the C statistic (1). For
IPAW prediction models, we used backward model selection using all pairwise interactions in Ci*, including those between
race and each of the predictors in Ci to account for potential collider bias (4, 13). To examine the impact of weight modeling
decisions on the racial disparity estimates, a variety of weight
models were examined, speciﬁcally assessing the importance
of decisions of whether to exclude participants with prevalent
disease before or after weight estimation and selection methods for interaction terms.
The predicted probabilities (equation 2) were then multiplied
to obtain the estimated P(Si = 0 | Racei, Li, Ci) (equation 1),
which were then inverted and stabilized to create weights
used in standard analytical methods (4, 14). Stabilized
weights were created by multiplying the nonstabilized weights
by P(Si = 0 | Racei, Li). The premise behind the stabilization is
to reduce potential undue inﬂuence of the often highly variable
nonstabilized weights (14). While both stabilized and nonstabilized weights can provide unbiased estimates, reduction
of extremely large weights can provide gains in efﬁciency
(14, 15). After weight estimation, we used modiﬁed Poisson
regression models, applying stabilized weights, to estimate the
risk ratio between race and each incident risk factor (32).
To estimate the SACE, we used the 2-stage estimation technique outlined in Tchetgen Tchetgen et al. (6). First, separate

cohort was conducted approximately 10 years after baseline
assessment (2013–2016), with goals including assessment of
racial and geographic disparities in the development of stroke
risk factors. At the time of this second visit, 21.8% of the original REGARDS participants had died, and an additional
24.7% declined participation in the second in-home visit
(referred to as “withdrawal” henceforth). Retention rates
are similar to those of other cohort studies (25–27). In REGARDS, 16,146 (53.5%) participants completed the follow-up
visit, providing researchers with the opportunity to examine a
multitude of health status changes, including incident stroke
risk factors. Institutional review boards at all participating institutions approved the study, and all participants provided written
informed consent.

where Y1i and Y2i represent incident hypertension and LVH,
respectively. The regression coefﬁcients ψ1 and ψ2 quantify
the extent of survival bias (for incident hypertension and incident LVH, respectively) and the test of H0: ψk = 0, k = (1 for
incident hypertension, 2 for incident LVH) can be considered
a test for the presence of selection bias (6).
SACE estimation relies on several key assumptions (6). We
assume that all common causes of S and Y1 and Y2 are contained
within our confounders L and C and a set of unmeasured confounders U. Although permitting the existence of unmeasured
confounders U is an appealing feature of this approach to estimating the SACE, the approach is valid only under the assumption
that the structure of the relationship between Ui and Si follows:
logit ( Si = 1 | Racei , L i, Ci, Ui ) = αUi + f (Racei , L i, Ci ).
When there is no unmeasured confounding, logit (Si = 1|
Racei , L i, Ci, Ui ) = logit (Si = 1|Racei , L i, Ci ). These assumptions combine to yield that Y is independent of counterfactual survival status, conditional on L and C. Additionally,
the SACE methodology assumes that race is independent of
U given L and C and that impact of survival bias is the same
across the distribution of U among S = 0. Finally we must
assume correct model speciﬁcation (equations 3a and 3b).
To investigate potential selection bias, we estimated the race
association measured by risk ratio for both incident hypertension
and LVH using IPAW and SACE methods and compared these
results with the complete-case analysis. Conﬁdence intervals
used in both IPAW and SACE were obtained through empirical bootstrap (6, 33, 34). While SACE methods require adjustment for L and C in the ﬁnal analytical model, use of IPAW
circumvents this problem. To facilitate comparison of conventional analyses, IPAW, and SACE estimation, 3 models were
considered: Model 1 estimates the unadjusted (crude) association between race and each outcome, model 2 estimates racial
disparities in the outcomes adjusting for L, and model 3 estimates
racial disparities adjusted for both L and C. Statistical analyses

were performed in SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary,
North Carolina).
RESULTS

The original REGARDS study sample size was 30,239. After
excluding 56 participants with data anomalies (0.19%) and 236
(0.78%) with missing region, education, electrocardiogram R
wave aVL measurement, or systolic or diastolic blood pressure,
we had 29,947 participants with baseline characteristics to build
predictive models for study withdrawal and death (Web Figure 1,
available at https://academic.oup.com/aje). The cohort was 41%
black and 45% male, with 44% residing outside of the Stroke
Belt or Buckle and mean age of 64.8 (standard deviation, 9.4)
years. At baseline, 59% of participants had hypertension and 10%
had LVH. Table 1 displays attrition from withdrawal or death,
unadjusted odds ratios of each attrition mechanism, and C statistic
for each baseline predictor separately. The most predictive variables for study withdrawal were educational level, income level,
and neighborhood socioeconomic status (35, 36). Age, income
level, and self-reported general health were most individually predictive of death. Although C statistics linking race with withdrawal
(0.550; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI): 0.543, 0.557) and death
(0.514; 95% CI: 0.507, 0.521) were statistically different from 0.5,
the magnitude of association was modest.
Combining all baseline variables into collective models for
death and withdrawal (Table 2), we observed a C statistic
for study withdrawal of 0.636 (95% CI: 0.630, 0.645) and a
C statistic for death of 0.830 (95% CI: 0.825, 0.836) when
adjusting for covariates L, C, and those components of C*
selected through backward selection (see Web Table 1 for
model parameter estimates). Omitting C* for the SACE estimation, C statistics were 0.622 (95% CI: 0.613, 0.630) and 0.823
(95% CI: 0.816, 0.830) for withdrawal and death, respectively.
Examining IPAW weight distributions in Table 2, the range
of the nonstabilized (raw) weights was relatively narrow for
withdrawal (1.00–4.89) and larger for death (1.00–13.80).
Both nonstabilized weight distributions were heavily rightskewed. Those participants with largest weights in the death
model were typically over 80 years old at baseline, male, hypertensive, and had urban residence at baseline. Participants with
largest withdrawal weights were black, hypertensive, in the lowest income level, in the lowest neighborhood socioeconomic
quartile (35, 36), and had urban residence at baseline. Note that
because these individuals were hypertensive at baseline, they
were excluded from analyses where incident hypertension was
the outcome.
The follow-up sample consisted of 12,604 participants with
complete data. After removing those with missing or prevalent
risk factors, analytical sample sizes were 5,530 for incident
hypertension analysis and 9,969 for incident LVH analysis
(Web Figure 1). Table 3 provides the risk ratio for black versus
white persons, using models 1–3. From model 2 of incident
hypertension adjusted for L, black persons had an estimated
risk ratio of 1.43 (95% CI: 1.33, 1.54) and 1.41 (95% CI: 1.34,
1.54) compared with white persons using complete-case analysis
and IPAW-stabilized weighting with no death or withdrawal,
respectively. In the incident hypertension model 3, which
additionally adjusts for C, the estimated risk ratio for race

predictive models of death and withdrawal were ﬁtted using
all participants, but only main effects of predictors in L and C
were included so that survival prediction models and analytical models contained the same set of variables (6). As in the
IPAW analysis, predicted probabilities of both attrition mechanisms were combined to obtain predicted P(Si = 0 | Racei, Li, Ci)
(equation 1). In the second estimation stage, the predicted P(Si =
1 | Racei, Li, Ci) ≡ Qi was included as a covariate in the model assessing the relationship between race and incident risk factor.
Speciﬁcally, we used modiﬁed Poisson regression models to estimate risk ratio of racial disparity in the 2 risk factors. The second
stage models for incident hypertension and incident LVH are
expressed

DISCUSSION

Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/aje/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/aje/kwy253/5193169 by guest on 12 February 2019

Compared with white participants, black participants in REGARDS have increased risk of both incident hypertension and
incident LVH, with and without adjustment for all covariates in
L and C. These estimates of racial disparity are similar when
employing complete-case, IPAW, and SACE analyses, indicating little evidence of selection bias in estimation of racial inequalities for these outcomes.
While our attrition model for death has reasonably high predictive ability, combination of all baseline predictors for the withdrawal model increased the C statistic only marginally. Even
inclusion of all pairwise interactions from backward selection
increased these predictive measures only slightly. The C statistics
for death (0.83) and withdrawal (0.64) are very similar to those
found in a recent study of smoking and cognitive decline, which
reported C statistics of 0.79 and 0.62, respectively (15). This
consistency is noteworthy because the study populations were
quite different. We included more baseline behavioral and clinical measures in our models, but for the mortality model, the
best individual predictors were age, income, and self-rated health.
No measured variables were especially predictive of withdrawal from the study, although education had the highest
unadjusted C statistic. From an epidemiologic perspective,
inability to predict study withdrawal using available social,
behavioral, or clinical assessments gives some optimism
that the withdrawal mechanism is random in nature rather
than systematically related to outcomes.
One reason for the lack of difference between complete-case
and IPAW analyses is likely due to none of the baseline predictors being notably predictive of study withdrawal. Although
many of our predictors are subject to change after baseline
measurement, these baseline variables have been shown to
predict mortality and are expected to have enduring effects.
However, there might exist an unmeasured confounder highly
related to both race and these incident stroke risk factors that is
causing selection bias. Nonetheless, REGARDS provides an
unusually comprehensive list of likely predictors of study attrition. The relatively small range of nonstabilized weights observed,
particularly for the study withdrawal model, is expected when
measured baseline characteristics are not strongly predictive of
attrition (37). Selection bias arises if attrition is inﬂuenced by both
the exposure, or its determinants, and the outcome of interest or its
determinants (4).
The usefulness of statistically creating artiﬁcial populations
through IPAW, particularly those analyses that reﬂect no death
over extended follow-up time, has drawn criticism as unrealistic
to the natural life span, sometimes referred to as “up-weighting
the dead” (4, 38). Both IPAW and SACE introduce a complexity
in the analysis where multiple analytical decisions must be made,
including which mechanisms for attrition should be considered,
and which factors should be considered as predictors for each
potential attrition mechanism. Loken and Gelman (39) argued
that complex procedures introducing numerous decision points in
which analysis is contingent on the data are undesirable because
they lead to unrecognized multiple comparisons problems and
render typical measures of uncertainty uninformative.

Use of estimated IPAWs to account for selection is subject to
several assumptions, including positivity (nonzero probability of
receiving every level of exposure for every combination of values
of exposure and covariate histories that occur among individuals
in the population) and correct model speciﬁcation to estimate
IPAWs. Assuming correct attrition-model speciﬁcation, IPAW
has been shown to be appropriate under the missing-at-random
assumption. One study has presented simulation results indicating that IPAW performs adequately under the missing-not-atrandom assumption, provided the missingness model is correctly
speciﬁed (40). Given that validity of the missingness models
(equation 2) is a crucial assumption of IPAW, we investigated
the impact of various modeling decisions on racial disparity estimates, ﬁnding little to no change in estimates (Web Table 2).
The regression model method for estimating SACE relies
on several assumptions, enumerated above and in Tchetgen
Tchetgen et al. (6) in extensive detail. The remarkable advantage to this approach is that SACE is unbiased under certain
assumptions even when there are unmeasured common causes
of selection bias and the outcome. Although the independence
of unmeasured confounding U and race conditional on C is a
relatively strong assumption, we have included many variables in C through which U might act. However, the existence
of unmeasured confounders operating differently from those
confounders considered here could introduce bias that we
have not addressed here. It has been demonstrated mathematically and recently in published simulations that, under the
right assumptions, selective attrition can introduce substantial
bias in effect estimates. This bias occurs only when unmeasured confounders of selection and the outcome interact with
race to affect persistence in the study (4, 13). The strength of
association induced by such collider bias phenomena is often
small and is constrained by the magnitude of the effect of exposure on attrition, the strength of the effect of the unmeasured
common cause of attrition and survival, and whether the
unmeasured factor and exposure interact on a multiplicative
scale to determine continued study participation (4, 13, 41, 42).
Although it might seem very likely that there are unmeasured
confounders of selection and health outcomes not included in
our analysis, the key question is the extent to which those factors interact with race to inﬂuence selection. Our analyses show
that for a diverse set of social, behavioral, and clinical measures, the answer is: not to a great extent.
Attrition in REGARDS is not atypical compared with other
studies of aging (43, 44), so it is extremely encouraging that we
ﬁnd limited evidence of selection bias. Nonetheless, many categories of measures, such as social network characteristics, literacy, and personality were not addressed here and seem plausible
as unmeasured confounders of selection and health. We hope
that future research prioritizes evaluating these domains and
their potential to introduce selection bias. We found limited evidence of major multiplicative interactions with race and other
factors in predicting either study withdrawal or mortality. It is
therefore not surprising that the IPAW method did not alter results substantially. We cannot be sure whether the same observation would hold for any unmeasured common cause of
attrition and our outcomes, but the similarity of SACE and
complete-case analysis supports this implication.
From this large cohort study with moderate attrition over
follow-up, we found no evidence of selection bias, despite

substantial racial differences in attrition. Although no bias due
to survival was observed, concerns about selection bias due to
differential survival should nevertheless always be carefully
considered and assessed. Few studies have comprehensive data
to evaluate this issue empirically, and REGARDS is especially
well-positioned to quantify any plausible impact of selection
bias. Despite our extensive list of potential predictors of attrition,
we have no evidence that accounting for survival altered our estimates of racial disparity in incidence of 2 important stroke risk
factors.
