Instrumental Variables for Binary Treatments
with Heterogenous Treatment Effects: A
Simple Exposition∗
Alan Manning

Abstract
This note provides a simple exposition of what IV can and cannot estimate in a model with
binary treatment variable and heterogenous treatment effects. It shows how linear IV is essentially
a misspecification of functional form and the reason why linear IV estimates will generally depend
on the instrument used is because of this misspecification. It shows that if one can estimate the
correct functional form then the treatment effects are independent of the instruments used. However, the data may not be rich enough in practice to be able to identify these treatments effects
without strong distributional assumptions. In this case, one will have to settle for estimations of
treatment effects that are instrument-dependent.

Manning: Heterogenous Treatment Effects: A Simple Exposition

Introduction
In the programme evaluation literature where ‘treatment’ is endogenous, applied
economists make widespread use of the method of instrumental variables to ‘deal’
with the problem of endogeneity bias. Where the effect of treatment on the
outcome variable is the same for everyone (the homogeneous treatment effect
case) IV provides consistent estimates of this treatment effect and this is
independent of the instrument used. But, economists have become more
interested in the heterogeneous treatment effect case and the question then arises
as to what exactly IV estimates. Although the literature on this subject is very
large and very thorough, experience (mainly personal) tells me that there is
considerable confusion about these matters among many practising applied
economists. The purpose of this note is to provide a very simple exposition of the
main results in the literature that can be found in the work of Angrist, Heckman
and Imbens amongst others1.
It shows that heterogeneous treatments effects introduce a non-linear
relationship between the mean of the outcome variable conditional on the
instrument and the mean of the treatment variable conditional on the instrument.
Linear IV (2SLS) estimates depend on the instrument used because it incorrectly
fits a linear specification to this non-linear model. The paper shows that if one
can estimate the correct functional form then the estimated treatment effects are
independent of the instrument used. However, the data may not be rich enough in
practice to be able to identify these treatment effects without strong distributional
assumptions. In this case, one will have to settle for estimates of treatment effects
that are instrument-dependent.
1.
The Set-Up
To keep things as simple as possible, we assume that there is an outcome variable
Y, a binary treatment variable D that takes the value 0 if the individual does not
receive the treatment and 1 if they do, and an instrument Z that might be binary,
discrete or continuous. We omit other (exogenous) covariates in the interests of
simplicity though it would be simple to include them2. We also restrict discussion
to the estimation of the treatment effects: we do not, for example discuss how one
would compute standard errors for those estimates though standard techniques can
be used for this.
1

A reader of this literature will be aware that a certain amount of attention is paid to the question
of ‘who said what when’ with identical or similar results being presented in different papers as
novel. I am even less of an historian of econometric thought than I am an econometrician and
have no expertise in this question of attribution so the references in this paper to where results can
be found should not be taken to imply this is the origin of the result referred to.
2
There is a cost here as the omission of covariates means we remove the possibility of observed as
well as unobserved heterogeneity. In many practical applications it may well be that the best
approach to the problem of unobserved heterogeneity is to model as much of it as possible.

A good starting-point is the ‘potential outcomes’ framework. Denote by
Y ( 0 ) the outcome for an individual if they do not receive the treatment and Y (1)

the outcome if they do. The treatment effect for an individual is Y (1) − Y ( 0 ) .
Define β 0 = E Y ( 0 )  and β1 = E Y (1) − Y ( 0 )  . We can write:
Y ( 0) = β0 + U

(1)

Y (1) = β 0 + β1 + U + U1

(2)

where E [U ] = 0 by construction and:

where E [U1 ] = 0 . Using this notation the treatment effect for an individual is

( β1 + U1 ) .

The homogenous treatment effect case obviously corresponds to the

case where U1 = 0 . Because only one treatment status is observed for each
individual it is never possible to estimate individual treatment effects and the
researcher must content themselves with hoping to be able to estimate some
average treatment effects.
Once there is heterogeneity in treatment effects, there is a question about
what treatment effects are we interested in. In this note we focus on just two:
- the average treatment effect (ATE) which here is just β1
- the treatment effect on the treated (TT) which here is:
TT = β1 + E (U1 D = 1)
(3)
This note is concerned with the circumstances in which it is possible to estimate
these treatment effects and, if that is not possible, what can be estimated.
Using (1) and (2) the observed outcome can be written in a ‘regression’
format as:
Y = (1 − D ) Y ( 0 ) + DY (1) = β 0 + β1 D + U + DU1
(4)
Note that because the specification in (1) and (2) is completely general there is no
functional form restriction like linearity in (4) because D can only take two
values.
We assume that one cannot simply obtain estimates of (4) by OLS as D is
potentially correlated with U and U1 .
We need to specify the model determining D. A general specification (see
Vytlacil, 2002, for more extensive discussion) is the following:
D* = E ( D Z ) − V
(5)
D = I ( D* ≥ 0 )
where V is uniformly distributed on [0,1]. The familiar probit or logit models
(amongst many others) can be written in the form of (5). V is potentially

correlated with (U , U1 ) . But Z is assumed to be independent of (U , U1 , V ) - this is
stronger than the mean independence assumption used in traditional IV but most
researchers will be happy to make this stronger assumption in practice.
2.
Instrumental Variables
One way of thinking about IV is as a two-step procedure (the most familiar
incarnation of which is two-stage least squares). In the first stage one estimates
the expectation of the endogenous variable conditional on the instruments i.e.
estimates E ( D Z ) which, given that D here is binary, amounts to estimating
Pr ( D = 1 Z ) . There are many ways, parametric and non-parametric, in which one

might do this: for our purposes here we will simply assume that we have a
consistent estimate of this relationship.
In the second stage, the relationship between the outcome variable, Y, and
E ( D Z ) is estimated i.e. one estimates the relationship between the expectation
of the outcome variable conditional on the instruments, E (Y Z ) , and the

expectation of the treatment variable conditional on the instruments E ( D Z ) . In

traditional 2SLS one models this as a linear relationship but, as we shall see, that
is inevitably a misspecification of functional form for the model considered here
when there is any heterogeneity in treatment effects.
To see this, take expectations of Y conditional on Z in (4) as the second
stage of 2SLS does. This leads to:
E (Y Z ) = β 0 + β1 E ( D Z ) + E (U1 D Z )
(6)
= β 0 +  β1 + E (U1 D = 1, Z )  E ( D Z )
Note that the coefficient on E ( D Z ) in the final line is the treatment effect on the
treated, conditional on Z: for future use let us denote this by TT(Z) and define it
as:
TT ( Z ) = β1 + E (U1 D = 1, Z )
(7)
Using (5) and the independence of Z and U1 , the final line in (6) can be written
as:
E ( Y Z ) = β 0 +  β1 + E U 1 V ≤ E ( D Z )  E ( D Z )

for some function κ E ( D Z ) . Note that this model is intrinsically non-linear in

E ( D Z ) if there is any heterogeneity in treatment effects and an endogeneity

problem. In fact, the non-linearity of the relationship in (9) is, given the
assumptions made, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of
heterogeneity in treatment effects that are correlated with treatment status. So, a
test of non-linearity is a test of this hypothesis (although such a test may have low
power if there is little variation in E ( D Z ) in the data).
This intrinsic non-linearity helps us to understand the limitations of the
familiar IV estimator for this model. As the ‘true’ relationship between E (Y Z )
and E ( D Z ) is non-linear, fitting a linear relationship is a misspecification of

functional form. As in any misspecification of this type the actual coefficient one
will estimate depends on where the data actually is and this depends on the
instrument3. This is why linear IV estimates depend on the instrument used.
If one wants to estimate the true model (9) one obviously has to use an
estimator that allows the relationship between E (Y Z ) and E ( D Z ) to be nonlinear. The workings of the model can most simply be understood using a
diagram. Figure 1 plots a possible relationship between E ( Y Z ) and E ( D Z ) in
(9) – the actual curve will depend on the instrument used 4. But, note that,
independent of the instrument and the distribution of the errors E (Y Z ) = β 0

when E ( D Z ) = 0 and E (Y Z ) = β 0 + β1 when E ( D Z ) = 1 . The latter follows
because:

κ (1) = E (U1 V ≤ 1) = E (U1 ) = 0

(10)

given the assumption that V is uniformly distributed on the unit interval.
One can use Figure 1 to depict the different treatment effects. For example,
the treatment effect on the treated conditional on Z=z0, is given by the slope of the
3

One can readily construct examples in which this misspecification is very large or very small so
it is hard to say whether this is a ‘big deal’ in practice or not. The estimated ‘treatment’ effect
from linear IV will never be outside the range of the individual treatment effects (a statement that
may be useless if these cover all of the real line) so can always be interpreted as a weighted
average of the individual treated effects. However, this way of thinking about the estimate in the
general case is not very helpful as the weights are unknown.
4
The actual shape of this relationship drawn in Figure 1 comes from the familiar case where we
have a probit model for the determination of D and the errors are jointly normally distributed. In
this case (9) can be written as:

( (

E (Y Z ) = β 0 + β1 E ( D Z ) + ρσφ Φ −1 E ( D Z )

))

chord connecting the curve at E ( D Z = z0 ) to the point on the curve where

E ( D Z ) = 0 : this is depicted on Figure 15. And the ATE is given by the slope of

the chord connecting the curve at E ( D Z ) = 1 to the point on the curve where

E (D Z ) = 0 .

The ATE will clearly be independent of the instrument used but TT(Z) is
obviously not. But, if one can successfully estimate the non-linear relationship
(9) then the estimated treatment effects will be independent of the instrument
used. To see this, let us leave to later the identification of (9) and assume that we
do have consistent estimates available.
If one can estimate the model of (9) then one can estimate TT(Z) as given
by (7). Obviously it will depend on Z, the instrument which may have no
intrinsic interest. We are more likely to be interested in the treatment effect
unconditional on Z. To obtain this we need to weight TT(z) by the density
function of Z conditional on D=1, f Z D ( Z D = 1) . Now we have that:
f Z D ( z D = 1) =

E ( D z ) fZ ( z)

(11)
E ( D)
where f Z ( z ) is the marginal density function of Z. The following result holds
whether Z has a discrete or continuous distribution but, to keep the notation
simple, we will assume it has a continuous distribution. In this case the estimated
treatment effect on the treated for the population can be written as:
∫ TT ( z) E ( D z ) f Z ( z )dz
TT = ∫ TT ( z ) f Z D ( z D = 1) dz =
E ( D)

which is the true value and is independent of the instrument used. In practice, one
way to compute this is to use the estimates of TT(Z) and then simply average this
across the sample members for whom D=1 (a similar reasoning can be found in
Angrist and Imbens, 1991).
But there is a simpler way to estimate TT in this case using a linear IV
estimator. The trick is to define a binary instrument (let us denote it by Z ) that
= β1 +

If one is interested in it, the treatment effect on the untreated is given by the slope of the chord

takes the value one if E ( D Z ) > 0 and zero if E ( D Z ) = 0 . We can then show
that TT is given by:
TT =

(
) (
)
E ( D Z = 1) − E ( D Z = 0 )
E Y Z = 1 − E Y Z = 0

(13)

i.e. is the linear IV estimate of Y on D using Z as an instrument. Because the
proof of this detracts from the main story, the proof is in the Appendix. However,
the intuition is very simple. For those with the value of Z such that E ( D Z ) = 0 ,
the average value of Y will be β 0 as Z is a valid instrument. For all other
observations the average value of Y will be β 0 plus the fraction receiving
treatment times the average treatment effect for this group. The treatment effect
on the treated can then be found by taking the difference in the value of Y for the
two groups and dividing by the fraction treated in the second group.
The discussion in this section has assumed that one can successfully
estimate the relationship in (9) and has shown how the treatment effects can be
identified from a knowledge of this relationship. But, as the next section makes
clear, it may not be so easy to identify treatment effects in practice.
3.Identification
The previous discussion presumed that one could identify the relationship in (9).
Let us now consider whether this is possible or not. Start by considering the case
where one takes a non-parametric approach to estimation and does not impose any
a priori functional form restrictions on κ E ( D Z ) . For every value of E ( D Z )

(

)

observed in the data one will be able to estimate E (Y Z ) so will observe that

point on the curve in Figure 1. But, as the prior discussion of Figure 1 has made
clear to identify TT(Z) one needs to estimate the slope from the origin to
E (Y Z ) : for that one needs to observe some value of Z for which E ( D Z ) = 0
(i.e. to observe the value of Y for some group who will never take the treatment).
This result is in Angrist and Imbens (1991) or Heckman and Vytlacil (2000). If
one observes data at the origin then one can identify TT(Z) for every value of Z
observed in the support of the distribution, and one can then use this to estimate
TT as in (12) above. Note that one does not need to observe all possible values of
E ( D Z ) to identify TT as, in (12), the only values of Z that get any weight are
the ones in the support of the distribution and these can all be estimated.

The condition for the identification of the ATE can also be readily
understood from the earlier discussion of Figure 1. The ATE is the slope of the
line connecting the two endpoints in the curve in Figure 1: to estimate this we
need some observations on a group for whom E ( D Z ) = 0 and some on a group

for whom E ( D Z ) = 1 .

The condition for identifying TT that we have some observations for
whom E ( D Z ) = 0 is a strong requirement as the data may lie nowhere close to
this point. Suppose we are not in this fortunate position. What can be done in
this case?
One option is to use a specific assumption about the functional form of
κ E ( D Z ) and then use the estimates for extrapolation to estimate the value of

(

)

E (Y Z ) when E ( D Z ) = 0 . The risk is, of course, that the functional form may

be incorrect and the extrapolation lead to large errors, a risk that is particularly
large when the data is not close to the point E ( D Z ) = 0 . Any error in the
estimation of β 0 will translate one-for-one into an error in the estimation of TT.

If one does not observe any data for which E ( D Z ) = 0 and one is not

prepared to use extrapolation, what can be identified in this case? Let us consider
the worst-case scenario (that figures prominently in the work of Angrist and
Imbens – see Imbens and Angrist (1984), or Angrist (2004)) where we observe
only two values of E ( D Z ) i.e. the instrument is binary. Suppose the two values
are z0 and z1 as depicted in Figure 2. Then one only observes two points on the
curve in Figure 1 and one can do no more than estimate the slope of the line
connecting the two points. What is this an estimate of? If one makes the
monotonicity assumption of Angrist and Imbens that when E ( D Z ) rises all
those who were initially taking the treatment continue to do so plus some extra
(the compliers in their terminology) then the increase in E (Y Z ) will be the
result of the compliers switching from non-treatment to treatment. As a result the
IV estimator is the average treatment effect for the compliers. This is the local
average treatment effect (LATE) – a more formal proof can be found in Imbens
and Angrist (1984). LATE will not be independent of the instrument used,
although one can obtain results (shown in Angrist, 2004) that if the instrument is

symmetric and the distribution of the errors is also symmetric, then LATE will
equal the ATE6.
The case of a binary instrument is a bit pessimistic (especially as
covariates can also often be used as a source of variation in E ( D Z ) , although
typically at the cost of some restriction on functional form for the way the
covariates affect Y). So let us consider what can be identified when the
instrument takes a number of finite values e.g. we add an extra value of Z, z2, as
illustrated in Figure 2. One can join up each of the points on the curve observed
using a straight line and interpret the slopes as the LATE for each change in the
instrument. Or, one could begin to fit the curvature of the true relationship.
Suppose we take the latter approach and, in addition that Z is continuous over
some range. Then one can estimate the true curve over some interval. In
particular one can estimate the slope at each point. This slope is what Heckman
and Vytlacil (2000) call the marginal treatment effect (MTE). It can be thought of
as LATE for small changes in the value of the instrument. Note, that MTE, like
LATE will be instrument-dependent.
This discussion can be summarized as follows. If the data contains
observations on individuals for whom E ( D Z ) = 0 then one can identify TT and
the resulting estimate will be independent of the instrument used. However, one
cannot obtain this estimate by linear IV as the functional form is inevitably nonlinear although a transformation of the instrument can be found to allow the use of
linear IV. In addition, if one also has observations on individuals for whom
E ( D Z ) = 1 then one can identify ATE: again, this is instrument-independent. In
this case IV estimates have what Angrist calls external validity.
But, if the data is not that rich then one can hope to identify TT and ATE
only if one makes specific assumptions on functional form and extrapolates. But,
if one is loathe to do this then one has to settle for estimates of LATE and MTE
that are instrument-dependent. In this case, the IV estimates will have what
Angrist calls ‘internal validity’.
4.Conclusion
This note provides a simple exposition of what IV can and cannot estimate in a
model with a binary treatment variable and heterogeneous treatment effects. It

This result can be understood using Figure 1 as that is based on distributional assumptions that
make the relationship symmetric. If the two values of Z are such that they result in values of

E ( D Z ) are the equidistant from 0.5 then the slope of the line connecting them is the same as

ATE.

shows how ‘linear’ IV is a misspecification of functional form and the reason why
linear IV estimates for the binary treatment, heterogeneous treatment effect model
will always depend on the instrument used is because of this misspecification. It
shows that if one can estimate the correct functional form for the relationship
between E (Y Z ) and E ( D Z ) then the treatment effects are independent of the
instrument used. However, the data may not be rich enough in practice to be able
to identify these treatment effects without strong distributional assumptions. In
this case, one will have to settle for estimates of treatment effects that are
instrument-dependent.
There is one other important issue that should be mentioned. This note
has been about what one can estimate once one has decided that (1) and (2) is the
appropriate model and that one wants to estimate that model by IV. But there are
important questions about whether this is the best model to estimate and, if so, the
best way to estimate it. For example, the ‘control function’ approach to
estimation (which seeks to estimate the conditional distribution of Y on D and Z
jointly) may be preferable to IV in some circumstances. And, perhaps more
importantly, there is a tendency in some quarters to focus on unobserved
heterogeneity in treatment effects as that leads to ‘sexier’ econometrics when
paying careful attention to observed heterogeneity might actually deliver more
useful estimates. The example analysed here can have no observed heterogeneity
because, in the interests of simplicity, we have excluded covariates from the
model. But, in the presence of covariates, X, modelling observed heterogeneity
simply means allowing for some interaction between D and X something that can
be handled very straightforwardly. I suspect there are many situations in which
researchers pay insufficient attention to this humdrum approach and I would not
be happy if this note encouraged this practice.
