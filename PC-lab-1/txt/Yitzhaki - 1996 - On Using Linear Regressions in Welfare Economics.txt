On Using Linear Regressions in
Welfare Economics
Shlomo YITZHAKI

Falk Institute and Department of Economics, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem 91905, Israel
This article consists of two parts. The first part shows that the ordinary least squares regression
coefficient is a weighted average of slopes between adjacent sample points. When applied to a linear regression, with income as the independent variable, the regression coefficient depends heavily
on the slopes of high-income groups. The weight of the highest income decile may well exceed
that of the other nine deciles. This may be undesirable, especially if the regression is used for
welfare analysis, because the marginal propensities to consume attributed to the commodities are
determined by the high-income groups. The second part of the article proposes alternative estimators, the extended Gini estimators, that enable investigators to control the weighting scheme and
to incorporate their social views into the weighting scheme of the estimators.

KEY WORDS: Extended Gini; Gini regression; Tax incidence.

The weight wi depends both on the rank of the observation and on its distance from the adjacent observation, as

weight increases as the rank of the observation draws closer
to the median and as the distance between observations increases. To control for the latter effect, consider the case

in which the observations of the independent variable are

Tabulation

Because w(x) is a function of the distribution of the independent variable, there are two possible presentations of

the weighting scheme. The first presents the weight as a
function of X, the second presents the weight as a function of Fx, the cumulative distribution of the independent
variable. The second presentation is useful whenever one is
interested in the share of the weights assigned to portions of
the population. The transformation from one presentation

the independent variable is a constant, then the weighting
scheme of the GMD is identical to that given by (8) for the

OLS estimator. For all other distributions of the independent variable, it can be shown that each decile is weighted
according to its share in income.
Olkin and Yitzhaki (1992) showed that this estimator is

For v > 1-that is, for inequality-averse social preferences-the weighting scheme increases for low values of
p, reaches a maximum, and then declines.
The effect of changing v on the weighting scheme is more

complicated because both the numerator and the denominator are affected, v -u 1 and v = 2 are special weighting
schemes. If v -+ 1-that is, if the investigator is indifferent
to inequality--then the weights are simply the distances be-

tween adjacent observations. The weight attached to each
decile is its share of the range, and the ranking of the obser-

GMD (v = 2, where each decile gets its share in income
as its weight). The OLS weighting scheme is presented in
Column (7). A comparison of the OLS weighting scheme
with the GMD weighting scheme shows that, by using the
Gini, the weight assigned to the behavior of the top decile

declines from around 60% under OLS to around 25%. The

weight of low-income deciles is still low, however. Using
v > 2 enables the user to increase the weight at the bottom

of the distribution. The rest of Table 3 presents weighting schemes for higher values of v. Experiments with other

samples show similar weighting schemes. Thus, the higher
v, the higher the weight attached to lower portions of the in-

come distribution. The weighting schemes are bell-shaped:
The higher v, the lower the decile receiving the highest
weights. Even for relatively large values of v, however, the

vation (person) in the income distribution is ignored. The

interested in the effect on weights. For examples that using

one does care about inequality-higher weights are given
to the lower segments of the income distribution.
