Summary. Comparing assessments on a subjective scale across countries or socio-economic

groups is often hampered by differences in response scales across groups. Anchoring vignettes
help to correct for such differences, either in parametric models (the compound hierarchical

ordered probit (CHOPIT) model and extensions) or non-parametrically, comparing rankings
of vignette ratings and self-assessments across groups. We construct specification tests of
parametric models, comparing non-parametric rankings with rankings by using the parametric estimates. Applied to six domains of health, the test always rejects the standard CHOPIT
model, but an extended CHOPIT model performs better. This implies a need for more flexible
(parametric or semiparametric) models than the standard CHOPIT model.

1. Introduction

Socio-economic surveys often ask ratings on some subjective ordinal scale. A typical ex

the analysis using these questions aims at comparing the objective reality across socio-e
groups or countries, and differences in reporting behaviour should be corrected for. T

these differences, King et al (2004) have proposed the use of anchoring vignettes.

B the majority evaluates the vignette person's health as better than their own. Then

the comparison with the vignette evaluation that (by assumption) uses the same
self-assessment. This method does not require any model or covariates (except to
the two groups).
The non-parametric method relies on two assumptions: reporting behaviour of the

We find that the standard CHOPIT model is always rejected, but a simple one-parameter
extension that allows for unobserved heterogeneity (which was used by Kapteyn et al. (2007),
for example) is rejected for some health domains but not for others. This suggests that conclusions about comparisons across countries or socio-economic groups based on the standard
CHOPIT model may be biased. It also implies that the existing tests for vignette equivalence or response consistency that rely on the CHOPIT model may not be valid. In contrast,
the non-parametric method is generally not a viable alternative since it cannot be used with
many covariates and cannot produce counterfactual distributions of self-reported health with

flexible parametric or semiparametric models that generalize the CHOPIT model.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the parametric models.
In Section 3, we introduce our diagnostic tests. Section 4 relates the tests to the non-parametric
approach. Section 5 presents the data. Section 6 describes the results of Monte Carlo simulations guiding how to implement the tests given the size and nature of our data. Our main results

are discussed in Section 7. Section 8 discusses implications of our findings for research using
anchoring vignettes.
2. Parametric model

Rossetti (2012) for modelling them jointly.) The response scale is a five-point scale from

The CHOPIT model consists of a self-assessment equation for the respondents' ev
their own health (in the given domain) and a vignette equation for the evaluati

3. Misspecification tests

There are many ways to test the specification of a fully parametric model in gen

can be performed against specific parametric extensions, such as heteroscedastic or no
errors (Chesher and Irish, 1987). Such tests will be powerful against specific alternativ

A general category of misspecification tests are the goodness-of-fit tests of Andrew
They partition the product space of outcomes and regressors Y x X into C cells (usuall

Under the null hypothesis that the parametric model is correctly specified, the sam

using the same sample. Under the null of no misspecification, the test statistic T is n times the
R2 of this regression and is asymptotically x2 distributed with degrees of freedom df equal to
the rank of the matrix A. In the usual case of C = My Mx product cells, df = ( My - 1 )M*. With

H = [A'B', the complete nx(C + L) regressor matrix, we have T = l'H(H'H)+H'l, where Z+
is the Moore-Penrose inverse of matrix Z. See Andrews (1988), page 154.
To give some intuition for this test, note that a perfect fit in the sense that, for each cell,
the average simulated cell probability equals the observed fraction of observations in that cell,

means that l' A = 0. Moreover, the first-order conditions of maximum likelihood always imply that 1/2? = 0. A perfect fit therefore implies T = 0 and not rejecting the null. The explained

sum of squares V A(Af A)+ A'l can be seen as a measure of how well observed cell fractions
are reproduced by the model. However, since the test statistic is based on estimated parameters, it does not have a x2-distribution. As shown by Andrews (1988), adding the scores in B
raises the explained sum of squares in case of an imperfect fit and leads to test statistics with a
X2 -distribution.
Different partitions of Y and X give different tests, with power in different directions. We
shall use the partition of Y that is the basis for the non-parametric approach described below
in Section 4. In a sense, this partition 'matters' since this kind of comparison is one of the main

goals of using anchoring vignettes. Since the test is asymptotic, the number of observations
must be large to guarantee that the size of the test is approximately equal to the asymptotic
size of 5%. In practice, this means that we will have to merge cells to guarantee that the number of observations in each cell is reasonably large. We performed simulations to compute the
actual size of the test for various partitions and our choice of cells is based on these simulation
outcomes; see Section 6.

4. Non-parametric approach
The non-parametric approach is explained by King et al. (2004) and King and Wand (2007). It
compares the distribution of the underlying objective reality purged of differences in reporting

behaviour across countries or socio-economic groups. This is done by comparing where the
self-assessments are placed on the scale fixed by the vignette evaluations in each country or
group. The numerical example in Table 1 with only one vignette illustrates this.
These cross-tabulations give the joint distributions of self-assessments and vignette evalua-

tions of health problems in a given domain in countries A and B. Looking at the (marginal)
distribution of the self-assessments only (the final column) would lead to the conclusion that
respondents in country B face fewer health problems than respondents in country A - assuming
that they use the same response scales. The difference in the marginal distribution of the vignette
evaluations (the final rows), however, shows that this assumption is incorrect: respondents in

country A evaluate a given health problem as more problematic, on average, and this may be
an alternative explanation for the cross-country difference in self-assessments.
The non-parametric approach simply compares the relative distributions, i.e. how the selfassessments rank compared with the vignette evaluations in the two countries. The relative
rankings RR are as in Table 2.
The distribution of RR in country A is stochastically dominated by that in B, showing that,
accounting for differences in response behaviour, the health problems in B are more serious
than in A. This is the reverse of the conclusion based on self-assessments only.
This example has only one vignette. King et al. (2004) considered the case with K > 1
vignettes, assuming that the evaluations of the vignettes are ranked in the same way by each
respondent and that no respondent gives the same rating to any two vignettes. In that case a

6. Simulations: how to choose the cells

Our tests rely on asymptotic theory keeping the number of cells fixed, with the number of
vations going to oo (see Andrews (1988)). As a consequence, the finite sample properties of
test may be poor if some cells have few observations. The same problem arises with the cl
Pearson x2-test, where a common rule of thumb is that no more than 20% of the expecte
counts should be less than 5 and all expected counts should be at least 1 (Yates et al. (1999),

734). Such a rule of thumb is not available for the Andrews test. We performed some

Carlo simulations to determine whether, for several given choices of the cells, the actual

7. Empirical results

This section presents the test results for each domain and for various partitions of
For each health domain, we first estimated the parametric model of Section 2. As
ple, the parameter estimates for concentration are presented in Table 8; estimates for
domains are available on request. The first column shows how, according to the p
model, problems with concentration are associated with individual characteristics and c
dummy variables, keeping response scales constant. Most results here are plausible and
findings in the literature (e.g. Bago d'Uva et al. (2008a)).
The other columns concern the threshold parameters. Many variables are significant,
ing that not accounting for differences in reporting behaviour would lead to biased est
of the parameters of main interest in the first column. The vignette dummy variables
bottom panel have the expected ranking, since the first vignette describes the mildest
lem, etc. Finally, the standard deviation of the unobserved heterogeneity term is quite
estimated, with 95% confidence interval [0.380, 0.426]. This suggests that extending the
PIT model with unobserved heterogeneity is useful, even though the role of this u
heterogeneity term is smaller than the roles of the noise terms £s; and 6v¿,v= 1,2, 3.
For each misspecification test characterized by a different partition of Y x X, the ce
bilities according to the parametric model were computed (numerically), using the give

For the partition of Y into four cells, the observed and predicted probabilities on wh
tests rely are presented in Table 10. For pain, concentration and depression the maximum

to 2.4 percentage points. Comparing the two distributions suggests that the difference

non-parametric approach - which compares two such rankings, distinguished on the basis of
X (e.g. two countries or groups of countries, men and women, etc.). This is why we also want
to consider partitions of Y x X. Each different partition of X gives a test with power in a spe-

cific direction, corresponding to the cells that are used by the non-parametric approach for
comparing specific groups.
The remaining rows in Table 9 present the /7-values for such tests. To guarantee sufficiently
large sample sizes, we consider only partitions of X into two or three cells, leading to a partition

of Y x X into between 2x3 = 6 and 3x6=18 cells. First, we consider a partition Y x country,
where countries are divided into two groups - southern Europe (Greece, Spain and Italy) and the
rest (Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden). This north-south division corresponds to the systematic differences that have been found in many studies based on the Survey of
Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe; see, for example, many chapters in Börsch-Supan et al.
(2005). In addition, we perform the test for partitions Y x sex and Y x age, with age categorized
into younger than 56, 56-65 and older than 65 years, Y x education, with education categorized
into low, middle and high, and finally Y x alone, distinguishing respondents living alone or not.

As expected (on the basis of the results for the partition of Y only) the null hypothesis is
rejected at the 5% or even the 1% significance level for all partitions of Y x X for breathing,
sleep and mobility: if the parametric model is already not able to reproduce the marginal distribution over the Y cells, it cannot give a good fit to the bivariate Y x X cells either. For the
other domains, pain, concentration and depression, the results are mixed. /7-values exceeding
5% are found for partitions Y x sex and Y x age for pain and for concentration. However, for all
domains, the null hypothesis is rejected for a partition of X by country or level of education. The
tests therefore do not support the use of the parametric model for comparing across (southern
versus northern) countries or levels of education.
Table 1 1 presents the predicted and actual distributions over the four cells in partition D2 for
southern and northern countries, illustrating the magnitude of the differences. In most cases, the
differences do not affect the qualitative conclusions on cross-country differences. For breathing, for example, 83.8% of southern respondents report less problems than any of the vignettes,
compared with 63.8% in the north, suggesting that, after correcting for response scale differences, people aged 50 years or older have larger problems with breathing in the north than in the
south. Using the parametric model's predictions, the percentages are 83.0% and 65.9% and the

conclusion remains the same. Other domains lead to the same qualitative conclusion: whether
using the raw data or the parametric predictions sometimes changes which cell frequency is
larger but does not affect the conclusion on where health in the given domain is better. This
conclusion also holds for other partitions of X (see Tables 3-6 of the on-line appendix).
To see why the tests often reject the parametric model, we performed several sensitivity checks.
First, Table 1 1 indicates that predicted and actual cell frequencies are not hugely different, but
differences are apparently sufficiently large to reject. A possible reason is that the Andrews
test accounts for the fact that parameters are estimated to fit the (same) data, by including the
likelihood scores in the auxiliary regression that is used to compute the test statistic (the matrix

B in Section 3). To see whether this matters, we also computed the test statistic without the
likelihood scores. Table 7 of the on-line appendix shows the resulting /7-values, which are often
much higher than the correct /7-values in Table 9. For sleep, for example, the fact that parameters
are estimated apparently makes it likely that, under the null hypothesis, predicted and observed
frequencies are very similar. Adjusting for this implies that the null hypothesis is already rejected
for quite modest differences between predicted and actual cell sizes. For breathing, in contrast,
all /?-values remain virtually 0. Here the discrepancies are such that the null would also be firmly
rejected if parameter values were given instead of estimated.

In the literature, there are two ways to use anchoring vignettes: parametric mode

the non-parametric approach. We apply the tests on six health domains of the pop
50 years and over in eight European countries, with mixed results: the standard C
is always rejected, but an extension of it incorporating unobserved heterogeneity in
scales is not rejected for several health domains and socio-economic characteristics
What does this imply for studies using anchoring vignettes? It does not imply t

when there are many ties. The latter seems a major reason for considering parame

Appendix A: Self-assessment questions and vignettes
Here we present examples of self-assessment questions and vignettes for two domains: concentration and
pain. For other domains, see the on-line appendix. Vignettes are in increasing order of the seriousness
of the health problems. All self-assessments and vignettes were rated on the five-point scale none, mild,
moderate, severe and extreme.

A.1. Self-assessment questions
(a) Concentration : 'Overall in the last 30 days how much difficulty did you have with concentrating or
remembering things?'.
(b) Pain : 'Overall in the last 30 days, how much of bodily aches or pains did you have?'.

A.2. Vignettes
