Comment: UnderstandingOR, PS and DR
Zhiqiang Tan

We congratulate Kang and Schafer (KS) on their ex
cellent article comparing various estimators of a popu
lation mean in the presence of missing data, and thank
the Editor for organizing the discussion. In this com

munication, we systematically examine the propen
sity score (PS) and the outcome regression (OR) ap
proaches and doubly robust (DR) estimation, which are
all discussed by KS. The aim is to clarify and better our
understanding of the three interrelated subjects.
Sections 1 and 2 contain the following main points,
respectively.

(a) OR and PS are two approaches with different
characteristics, and one does not necessarily dominate

the other. The OR approach suffers the problem of
implicitly making extrapolation. The PS-weighting ap
proach tends to yield large weights, explicitly indicat

and their difference, ?jl\ ? ?jlq, which gives the aver
age causal effect (ACE). KS throughout focused on the
problem of estimating \x\ from the data (X?, 7}, 7}F;),

of the ACE can be separated into independent estima
tion of the means \i\ and ?jlq. We shall in Section 3 dis

cuss subtle differences between causal inference and
solving two separate missing-data problems, but until
then we shall restrict our attention to estimation of ?jl\

from (Xi,Ti,TiY?) only.
The model described at this stage is completely
nonparametric. No parametric modeling assumption
is made on either the regression function m\(X) =
E(Y\T = 1, X) or the propensity score n(X) = P(T ?

observed among subjects with n(X) ^ 0. The diffi
culty holds whatever parametric approach, OR or PS,
is taken for inference, although the symptoms can be
different. This point is central to our subsequent dis

bound.

OR-model building works on the "truncated" data
{(Xi,Yi):Ti = 1} within treated subjects. Therefore,
any OR model relies on extrapolation to predict m \ (X)
at values of X that are different from those for most

treated subjects [i.e., n(X) ^ 0]. The usual model
checking is not capable of detecting OR-model mis
specification, whether mild or gross, in this region
of X. (Note that finding high-leverage observations
can point to the existence of such a region of X, not

model misspecification.) This problem holds for low
or high-dimensional X, and is separate from the diffi
culty to capture m\ (X) within treated subjects when X
is high-dimensional [cf. KS's discussion below display
(2)]. In contrast, the PS-model building works on the
"full" data {(Xi, 7/)} and does not suffer the presence
of data truncation, although suffering the same curse
of dimensionality. The exercise of model checking is

capable of detecting PS-model misspecification. The
matter of concern is that successful implementation is
difficult when X is high-dimensional.

Regarding question (b), KS (Section 2.1) suggested
that the (A)IPW estimator is sensitive to misspecifica

tion of the PS model when n(X) ^ 0 for some val
ues of X. For example, if n(X) ? 0.01 is underesti
mated at 0.001, then, even though the absolute bias is

small (= 0.009), the weight n~l(X) is overestimated
by 10 times higher. In this case, the estimator has in
flated standard error, which can be much greater than
its bias. In contrast, if the OR model is misspecified,

then the bias of the OR estimator is the average of
those of rh\(X) across individual subjects in the orig
inal scale, and can be of similar magnitude to its stan
dard deviation.

In summary, OR and PS are two approaches with
different characteristics. If an OR model is correctly
specified, then the OR estimator is consistent and has
asymptotic variance no greater than the semiparamet
ric variance bound. Because of data truncation, any OR

2. UNDERSTANDING DR
The OR or the (A)IPW estimator requires specifica
tion of an OR or a PS model, respectively. In contrast,
a DR estimator uses the two models in a manner such
that it remains consistent if either the OR or the PS

model is correctly specified. The prototypical DR esti
mator of Robins, Rotnitzky and Zhao (1994) is

the OR approach by incorporating a PS model.
Local efficiency implies that if the PS model is cor

also correct, or the PS model is misspecified but the
OR model correct (see Tan, 2006, Section 3.2).
The different characteristics discussed in Section 1

persist between the PS (even using ?Iaipwm or ?REG
with the DR benefit) and OR approaches. The asymp
totic variance of ?Iaipw, ?AiPW,fix, or ?XREg if ?REG the

PS model is correctly specified is no smaller, whereas
that of ?ior if the OR model is correctly specified is
no greater, than the semiparametric variance bound.
Moreover, if the OR model is correct, the asymptotic

variance of ?Iaipwm or ?REG is still no smaller than
that of ?1 or- Therefore:

Proposition 5. The asymptotic variance of

?AIPWM or ?REG if either a PS or an OR model is
correctly specified is no smaller than that of ?Ior if
the OR model is correctly specified and m\(X) is effi
ciently estimated in ?oR>
Like Proposition 2, this result does not establish ab
solute superiority of the OR approach over the PS-DR
approach. Instead, it points to considering practical is
sues of model specification and consequences of model

misspecification. There seems to be no definite com
parison, because various, unmeasurable factors are in
volved. Nevertheless, the points regarding questions
(a) and (b) in Section 1 remain relevant.
In summary, it seems more constructive to view DR
estimation in the PS approach by incorporating an OR
model rather than in the OR approach by incorporating

a PS model. The estimator ?Ireg provides a concrete
improvement upon ?ipw with both variance and bias
reduction in the sense that it gains efficiency whenever
the PS model is correctly specified (and maximally so

if the OR model is also correctly specified), and re
mains consistent if the PS model is misspecified but
the OR model is correctly specified. On the other hand,

comparison between ?Ireg and ??or is complicated by
the usual bias-variance trade-off. Different character

istics are associated with the OR and the PS-DR ap
proaches and should be carefully weighed in applica
tions.

3. OTHER COMMENTS
Control Vari?tes and Regression Estimators
The name "regression estimator" is adopted from
the literatures of sampling survey (e.g., Cochran, 1977,

Chapter 7) and Monte Carlo integration (e.g., Ham
mersley and Handscomb, 1964), and should be dis
tinguished from "regression estimation" described by

KS (Section 2.3). Specifically, the idea is to exploit

the fact that if the PS model is correct, then fj asymp

totically has mean fx\ (to be estimated) and ? mean
0 (known). That is, f serve as auxiliary variables (in
the terminology of survey sampling) or control vari?tes

(in that of Monte Carlo integration). Variance reduc
tion can be achieved by using ?(fj) ? ??(|), instead
of ?Xipw = E(fj), with b an estimated regression coef
ficient of fj against ?.

The control vari?tes for ?Xreg in Section 2 include

(fc~lT - l)mi and (T - ?)[?(l - A^d?/dy, the

second of which is the score function for the PS model

and is necessary for asymptotic optimality in Propo
sition 4(ii). If the PS model is correct, then ?Xreg is
always at least as efficient as ??ipw in the raw version,
that is, Aazpw(O), but not always than /Xipw in the ra
tio version. However, the indefiniteness can be easily
resolved. If the control var?ate ft~lT ? 1 is added, or

(l,mi)T substituted for rh\, then ?Xreg always gains
efficiency over both versions of ??ipw- Furthermore, if

(l,h,rh\)T is substituted for rh\, then ?Xreg always
gains efficiency also over the estimator /XaipwW.

Causal Inference
Causal inference involves estimation of both ?jl\ and
/xo. Similar estimators of ?o can be separately defined

by replacing T, ? and rh\ with 1 ? T, 1 ? fc and

mo, where mo = E(Y\T = 0, X). The control vari?tes
((1 ?Tt)~~l(l ? T) ? l)(l,mo)T for estimating ?jlq dif
fer from (tt~1T ? l)(l,mi)T for estimating /jl\. As
a consequence, even though ?X\,reg or ?Xo,reg indi
vidually gains efficiency over ?ijpw or jXqjpw, the
difference ?X\,reg ~ ??,REG does not necessarily gain
efficiency over jX\jpw ~ ??ojpw- The problem can be
overcome by using a combined set of control vari?tes,

say, [?~lT ? (1 ? jt)-1(1 ? T)](n, 1 ? ir, ftrho, (1 ?
Tt)rh\)T. Then ?X\,reg ? ?o,REG maintains optimal
ity in using control vari?tes in the sense of Proposi
tion 4(ii), in addition to local efficiency and double ro

bustness. The mechanism of using a common set of
control vari?tes for estimating both /x\ and ?o is au
tomatic in the likelihood PS approach of Tan (2006).

PS Stratification
KS (Section 2.2) described the stratification esti
mator of Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) as a way "to
coarsen the estimated propensity score into a few cat

egories and compute weighted averages of the mean
response across categories." It is helpful to rewrite the
estimator in their display (6) as

the true n (X) if the PS model is correct, and 5* is that

stratum average of m\(X) weighted proportionally to
7r(X). Therefore, /xstrat is inconsistent unless n(X) or
mi (X) is constant within each stratum (cf. KS's discus

sion about crude DR in Section 2.4). The asymptotic
bias depends on the joint behavior of m i (X) and n (X),
and can be substantial if m i (X) varies where n (X) ^ 0

varies so that mi(X) are weighted differentially, say,
by a factor of 10 at two X's with n(X) = 0.01 and 0.1.

Simulations

discussion in Section 2. The theory of DR estimation
does not claim that a DR estimator is guaranteed to
perform better than the OR estimator when the OR and
the PS models are both misspecified, whether mildly or
grossly. Therefore, KS's simulations serve as an exam
ple to remind us of this indefinite comparison.
On the other hand, neither is the OR estimator guar

anteed to outperform DR estimators when the OR
model is misspecified or even "nearly correct." As seen
from Table 2, ??or yields greater RMSE values than the

DR estimators, Awls, ?REG and ?^G when the alter
native, misspecified OR and PS models are both used.

For n ? 200, the bias of ??or is 2.5 and that of ?Ireg
is 0.44, which differ substantially from the correspond

ing biases ?0.56 and ?1.8 in Table 1 when KS models
are used.
The consequences of model misspecification are dif

ficult to study, because the degree and direction of

KS designed a simulation setup with an OR and a
PS model appearing to be "nearly correct." The re
sponse is generated as Y = 210 + 27.4Zi + 13.7Z2 +
13.7Z3 + 13.7Z4 + 6, and the propensity score n ?

expit(?Z\ + 0.5Z2 ? O.25Z3 ? O.IZ4), where e and
(Zi, Z2, Z3, Z4) are independent, standard normal.

The covariates seen by the statistician are Xi =

exp(Zi/2), X2 = Z2/(l + exp(Zi)) + 10, X3 (Z!Z3/25 + 0.6)3 and X4 = (Z2 + Z4 + 20)2. The

OR model is the linear model of Y against X, and the
PS model is the logistic model of T against X.
In the course of replicating their simulations, we ac

cidentally discovered that the following models also
appear to be "nearly correct." The covariates seen by

model misspecification are subtle, even elusive. For the
dataset examined earlier, the absolute differences be
tween the (highly correlated) fitted values of Y under
the correct and the alternative, misspecified OR models
present a more serious picture of model misspecifica
tion. In fact, the quartiles of these absolute differences
are 2.0, 3.2 and 5.1, and the maximum is 20.

For both Tables 1 and 2, the DR estimators ?Ireg
and ??req perform overall better than the other DR es

timators ?Iaipwm and ?WLS- Compared with ?Iwes,

?Ireg has MSE reduced by 15-20% (Table 1) or by
20-25% (Table 2) when the PS model is correct but
the OR model is misspecified, which agrees with the
optimality property of ?Ireg in Proposition 4(ii). Even

the statistician are the same Xi,X2,X3, but X4 =

DR estimators ?Ireg and ?jl^?g sometimes have size

dataset, Figures 1 and 2 present scatterplots and box

plots similar to Figures 2 and 3 in KS. For the OR
model, the regression coefficients are highly signifi
cant and R2 ? 0.97. The correlation between the fitted

the simplified estimator ??^?G gains similar efficiency,

able biases even when the PS model is correct.

Summary

0.93. Tables 1 and 2 summarize our simulations for KS
models and for the alternative models described above.

One of the main points of KS is that two (moder
ately) misspecified models are not necessarily better
than one. This point is valuable. But at the same time,
neither are two misspecified models necessarily worse
than one. Practitioners may choose to implement ei
ther of the OR and the PS-DR approaches, each with
