ABSTRACT
On Event Study Designs and DistributedLag Models: Equivalence, Generalization
and Practical Implications*
We discuss important features and pitfalls of panel-data event study designs. We derive the
following main results: First, event study designs and distributed-lag models are numerically
identical leading to the same parameter estimates after correct reparametrization. Second,
binning of effect window endpoints allows identification of dynamic treatment effects
even when no never-treated units are present. Third, classic dummy variable event study
designs can be naturally generalized to models that account for multiple events of different
sign and intensity of the treatment, which are particularly interesting for research in labor
economics and public finance.

Introduction

The credibility revolution in empirical economics has led researchers to set up more transparent (quasi-)experimental research designs. This shift has increased the policy relevance
and the scientific impact of empirical work (Angrist and Pischke, 2010). An important element that enhanced transparency is the visualization of treatment effects and/or identiying
assumptions. Ideally, the main empirical take-away of the study can be summarized in one
graph. Differences-in-differences (DD) models are particularly popular design as they directly
derive from the rationale of experiments and are usually intuitive in terms of the empirical
model and the underlying assumptions. A particularly appealing specification, belonging
to the family of DD models, is the event study (ES) design. Originating from the finance
literature, event study designs have initially been used to analyze the impact of an unanticipated event on stock prices. This rationale has been translated to other fields of applied
economics, mostly public finance and labor economics. Here an event is usually defined as
a policy change and the outcome is the price or quantity of the market under study. Technically, the outcome variable in a year t is regressed on a set of dummy variables, which
indicate when the event has happened relative to t. In many ways, the event study design is
the poster child of empirical methods used in the credibility revolution since (i) coefficients
can be graphed, (ii) the graphs are very intuitive in the sense that both post-event effects
and the identifying assumption of “no pre-event trends” are immediately visible, and (iii)
the underlying econometrics are intuitive as they boil down to a simple panel data model
where the regressors of interest are a set of non-parametric event indicators which are defined
relative to the event. Figure 1 plots the use of event study designs in economics over time.
We measure the use by the share of studies mentioning the term “event study” in the Top
Five economics journals.1 While we see a steady increase since 1990, there is sharp increase
since 2010. Moreover this increase is mostly driven by the three journals focusing on applied
microeconomic work among the Top-Five, i.e. the American Economic Review (AER), the
Quarterly Journal of Economics (QJE), and the Journal of Political Economy (JPE).
Despite its intuitive appeal, there is remarkable heterogeneity in how event study designs
are implemented in practice. In particular, there is a tendency to refer to the term event study
rather loosely. First, there is the distinction between the original event study originating in
the finance literature and the adaption used in current applied micro research, mostly in
the fields of public and labor economics. Second, within the later field, some researchers
employ the term for a simple graph plotting an outcome for the treatment (and sometimes
the control) group relative to some event in the spirit of a difference-in-difference graphs. As

Notes: This graph plots the three-year moving average of the share of studies mentioning event study
designs in top economics journals. We use a 3-year moving average to control for mean reversion. The
Top 5 journals are the American Economic Review (AER), the Quarterly Journal of Economics (QJE),
the Journal of Political Economy (JPE), Econometrica and the Review of Economic Studies. We report
results for AER, QJE and JPE separately as these there journals are known to publish many applied
microeconometric studies.

a consequence, more than one third of the non-finance papers published in the AER, QJE or
JPE since 2010 using event study designs do not specify a regression equation. Another issue
which leads to heterogeneity in the implementation of event studies is the treatment of the
ends of the effect window, which is the window within which the effect is studied.2 Among
the papers that specified a regression equation, only 15% discussed how they modeled the
endpoints, which – as it will turn out below – is important. Moreover, empirical economists
differ in how they apply the event study rationale to multiple events and events with different
treatment intensities.
The purpose of this paper is to clarify our understanding of event study designs both in
methodological and practical terms. We depart from the simplest institutional environment
in which event study designs are applied: in a typical panel set-up with a large number of units
and relatively few time periods, each unit receives one single-treatment – the event – at a unitspecific point in time. As necessary in most practical applications, we limit the effect window
to a finite number of leads and lags, which requires binning the endpoints of the window.
In this set-up, we show that event study coefficients are identical to the cumulated lags and
leads in a distributed-lag (DL) model. However, the equivalence requires to carefully choose

A more widely used synonym is event window, which as it will turn out, is less accurate.

the corresponding number of leads and lags and the length of the observation window for the
dependent variable and the event indicators in the DL and the ES model. Having derived the
equivalence between the standard ES design and DL models, we show that the rationale of
the equivalence can be easily generalized and adapted to institutional environments, which
are more common in public and labor economics. These environments include (i) multiple
events, such as a sequence of state-level minimum wage increases, (ii) events of different sign
and intensity of the treatment, such as a tax increase in one year and a decrease a couple of
years later. While making these methodological points, the paper provides practical advice
and highlights pitfalls when setting up event study designs and when comparing the results
of ES and DL models. We illustrate our results using simple numerical examples.
This paper adds to the recent methodological literature on event study and distributed-lag
models. Freyaldenhoven et al. (2018) suggest how to extend the standard event study design
to account for unobserved confounders generating a pre treatment trend in the outcomes
and still recover the causal effect of the event. Roth (2018) shows that treatment effects can
be biased conditional on passing the flat pre-trend test. Abraham and Sun (2018) point to
a different form of identification problem arising in the case of staggered treatments with
heterogeneous dynamic treatment effects – a similar problem also arises in static diff-in-diff
models (Athey and Imbens, 2018; de Chaisemartin and D’Haultfoeuille, 2018). In our setup, we assume homogeneous treatment effects and abstract from endogeneity concerns. In
this respect our study is related to Borusyak and Jaravel (2017) who point to a potential
underidentification problem in panel data event study designs where dynamic treatment
effects can only be identified up to a linear trend. We show below that restricting the effect
window at a certain lead/lag – a practical necessity in many applications – and binning the
endpoints alleviates such concerns by introducing parameter restrictions that help to separate
trends in the dynamic treatment and secular time effects even in the absence of never treated
units. At the same time, we show that choosing the length of the effect window determines
whether a unit-year observation is assigned to the treatment or the control group and hence
is not innocuous.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 sets up a standard version
of an event study model in the simplest institutional environment and shows that the specification is equivalent to a standard distributed-lag model. In Section 3, we generalize the
institutional environment and allow for multiple and heterogeneous events across and within
units. We show that event study designs can also be used in these settings, and discuss
the additional adjustments and assumptions that need to be made in this case. Section 4
concludes.

Standard Event Study Design

In this section, we show that the event study model is equivalent to a distributed-lag model.
We start by setting up the event study design in the simplest institutional environment and
refer to this model as the standard event study set-up throughout the paper. We then show
that this standard event study model is a re-parametrization of the distributed-lag model.
On the way, we stress important assumptions that are necessary for the correct specification
of both models. In Subsection 2.4, we illustrate all formal claims using a numerical example.

2.1

Set-up

We start our analysis with a standard event study set-up, where each unit i receives at
most one single treatment at unit-specific time ei . We intend to estimate the effect of this
treatment on our dependent variable y, which we observe at different time periods t = t, ..., t̄.
We call [t, ..., t̄] the observation window for the dependent variable. As the treatment effect is
allowed to vary over time, we are interested in studying its dynamics over a window ranging
from j < 0 periods prior to the event to j̄ ≥ 0 after the event. We refer to this window as the
effect window. In this set-up, the standard event study specification is given for all t = t, ..., t̄
by:
yit =

j̄
X

βj bjit + µi + θt + εit

(1)

j=j

where µi is a unit fixed effect, θt is a time fixed effect. In the standard set-up, bjit is a treatment
indicator for an event happening j ∈ [j, j̄] periods away from t, which is commonly defined
as



1[t ≤ ei + j] if j = j


bjit = 1[t = ei + j] if j < j < j̄



1[t ≥ e + j] if j = j̄ .
i

(2)

Treatment indicators bjit are binned at the endpoints, indicating if treatment for unit i at
time t happened j̄ or more periods ago, or j periods or more into the future. We rewrite
definition (2) and propose the following generalized, more versatile (cf. Section 3.3.2) and

In the standard set-up, dit is an event dummy that takes the value 1 in the year of the
treatment, ei , and zero otherwise. Section 2.4 shows the construction of the binned treatment
indicator in a numerical example.
Remark 1 (Limited effect window).
Following the standard, we limit the effect window to j < 0 periods prior to the event and
j̄ ≥ 0 after the event, i.e. the effect is assumed to stay constant before and after this effect
window. This is equivalent to an effect window from −∞ to ∞ and assuming βj = βj for all
j < j and βj = βj̄ for all j > j̄. This is achieved by binning the treatment indicator.
Remark 1 implies that the standard event study model relies on additional but often
economically plausible parameter restrictions. These restrictions reduce the number of parameters to be estimated and thereby alleviate potential underidentification problems (see
Section 2.3).
Due to the leads of lags of the treatment indicator in the event study model, information
on the treatment needs to be observed for a longer observation window than for the dependent
variable. In the following remark, we summarize the data requirements for a given observation
window of the dependent variable.
Remark 2 (Data requirements). For a given balanced panel of the dependent variable from
[t, t̄] and an effect window [j, j̄], we need to observe events from t − j̄ + 1 to t̄ + |j| − 1. If
events are derived from changes in policy variables, i.e. treatment status, we need to observe
treatment status from t − j̄ to t̄ + |j| − 1.
To understand the intuition behind Remark 2, it is first important to note that an event
that happens before t, i.e. the first data year of the dependent variable, can affect the outcome
like any other event happening between t and t̄ and needs to be taken into account. Likewise,
we should account for events that happen after t̄ if we want to test for pre-trends.
3

Note that the definition of endpoints in (3) is equivalent to other recently applied variants. In our
Pt̄−1

notation, the specification of Fuest et al. (2018) is given by bit =
s=t di,s−j and bit =
s=t+1 di,s−j̄ .
Pj
Pt−(t−j̄+1)
j
j̄
Likewise, it can be rewritten as bit = s=t−(t̄−j−1) di,t−s and bit = s=j̄
di,t−s , which is equivalent to
Smith et al. (2017) using t, t̄ instead of the implicitly assumed negative and positive infinity.

6

This rationale prompts the second question of how long before t and after t̄ do we need
to observe events at the minimum. From Remark 1, we know that treatment effects are
assumed to be constant after j̄ and before j periods. Hence, we need to observe events at
least from t − j̄ to t̄ + |j|. By Remark 2, it, however, suffices to observe events in one fewer
year at each end of the data window, hence from t − j̄ + 1 to t̄ + |j| − 1. To see this, consider
a case where the event takes place at t − j̄. Due to the binning, the treatment indicator bj̄it
will be equal to one for this unit for all t. Conditional on unit fixed effects, this unit cannot
be used to identify treatment effects An analogous argument applies at the other end of the
data window.
So far, we assumed to observe events directly. In many applications, an event is, however,
defined by the researcher as a change in policy variables, such as tax rates or minimum wages.
We call such policy variables the treatment status xit . In the standard set-up, treatment status
is a dummy variable that changes from 0 to 1 at the time of the event. If we generate event
dummies from changes in policy states, the observation window for the treatment status
needs to be observed for an additional period in the beginning, hence from t − j̄ onwards.
Figure 2.1 visualizes the required width of the observation window for a given limited effect
window.

Remark 3 (Standardization).
Treatment indicators bjit sum up to one over all j for treated units or to zero for non-treated
units.4 The parameters βj are therefore only identified up to a constant due to the individual
fixed effect µi . Thus at least one coefficient βj needs to be fixed as a standardization. We
follow the standard and drop the pre treatment indicator b−1
it from the regression, standardizing
its coefficient β−1 to zero.
The binned event indicators bjit are perfectly multicollinear with the individual effect µi because for all

t = t, ..., t̄:
j=j bit = 1 if t − j ≤ ei ≤ t + |j| and
j=j bit = 0 if ei < t − j or ei > t + |j|. For non-treated

as well not-yet treated and always-treated units (see below) units all indicators are zero for all t.

7

After the standardization β−1 = 0, the parameter βj is the effect j time periods after the
event compared to the level one period before the event.

2.2

Equivalence

Result 1 shows how the standard event study specification in equation (1) can be transformed
into an equivalent distributed-lag model:

changes from 0 to 1 at an event, i.e. xit = xi,t−1 + dit for all t = t − j̄ + 1, ..., t̄ + |j| − 1. Given
the standardization β−1 = 0, the event study effects β can be recovered from the distributed-lag
coefficient γ as

Proof: see Appendix A.
Result 1 encompasses various implications. Equation (5) shows that event study coefficients β are numerically identical to the cumulative sum of the distributed-lag coefficients
γj . When looking at post-treatment, that is j ≥ 0, the cumulative sum of γj for k = 0, ..., j
needs to be calculated. For pre-treatment, j < 0, we standardize the cumulated distributedlag coefficients analogously to the event study design by setting γ−1 = 0 (cf. Remark 3). We
then generate the cumulative sum for the pre treatment period by summing distributed-lag
coefficients away from zero (minus one) for each j <= −2.

The equivalence of event study and distributed-lag model with the re-parametrization in
(5) also holds in first differences:
∆yit =

=

j̄
X

γj ∆xi,t−j + θt + ∆εit

(7)

j=j+1

where ∆xi,t−j = di,t−j .
The distributed-lag specification in equation (4) immediately reveals that its estimation
requires to observe the event dummy dit from period (t − j̄ + 1) to (t̄ + |j| − 1) as in Remark 2.
Note that the distributed-lag specification is either a regression of levels on levels (equation
4) or of changes on changes (equation 7) while the event-study specification is a regression
of levels on (binned) changes (equation 1).5
Small differences in the notation are very important and distinguish distributed-lag and
event study models. In the event study, variables b have to be defined, which is indicated by
the superscript index j. In the distributed-lag model j is part of the time index and we need
no further definition of the distributed-lag variables. Vice versa, we can directly interpret
the coefficients of the event study design βj , while we need to cumulate the γ coefficients of
distributed-lag model to learn about the dynamic treatment effects.
Remark 4 (Deriving event study effects from the distributed-lag estimates).
Estimates for the event study effects β can be derived from the distributed-lag estimates γ
b
according to equation (5). This linear transformation transfers the statistical properties (conb Standard errors of βb can be
sistency and asymptotic normality) of γ
b to the calculated β.
calculated from the variances and covariances of the vector γ
b by the usual formula for linear
combinations. Point estimates and standard errors of directly estimating βb in the event study
model or of indirectly estimating βb in the corresponding distributed-lag model are numerically
identical.
Remark 5 (Interpreting the estimated parameters).
The models do not impose any restriction on the effect size across units. It is possible that
the event for unit i at time t has a different effect than the event happening in unit l at time
s. The coefficient βj , for all j ≥ 0, is the average effect of the treatment j periods after the
event. Likewise, βj , for all j < 0, is the average pre-treatment effect.
5

With an infinite effect window, the event study specification is just a regression of levels on changes in
P∞
the treatment status, i.e. a dummy variable for an event: yit = j=−∞ βj 1[t = ei + j] + µi + θt + εit =
P∞
j=−∞ γj xi,t−j + µi + θt + εit where ∆xit = dit = 1[t = ei + j] and γj = βj − βj−1 .

Estimation and Identification

The event study model in equation (1) and the distributed-lag model in equation (4) are
panel data models with a large number of units i = 1, ..., N over few time periods t = t, ..., t̄.
Both models include unit and time effects. The parameters β and γ, respectively, can therefore be estimated with standard fixed effects estimation including time period dummies.6
These estimates are consistent and asymptotically normal as N → ∞ under the standard
assumptions for panel data models with large N and small T . Alternatively, both models
can be estimated with standard ordinary least squares in first differences and including time
period dummies as in equations (6) and (7). The first difference estimator is consistent and
asymptotically normal under the same assumption as the fixed effects estimator in levels. Depending on the autocorrelation of the error term, either fixed effects estimation or estimation
in first differences is more efficient.
It is important to assure that the model is econometrically identified such that the dynamic
effects, βj , are distinguished from secular time trends, θt . Borusyak and Jaravel (2017)
show that with an infinite effect window, [j, j̄] = [−∞, ∞], the dynamic effects are only
identified up to a linear trend.7 However, limiting the effect window as in Remark 1 (by
binning of the event dummies in the event study model) introduces additional restrictions
that allow separately identifying dynamic effects, βj , and secular time trends, θt . Intuitively,
observations outside of the effect window are similar to never-treated units: they serve as
a control group and help to bin down secular time trends.8 Hence, binning of endpoints –
a practical necessity in many application – allows for identification even in the absence of
never-treated units and is an alternative to dropping an additional pre-treatment indicator
or resorting to unit random fixed effects. At the same time, choosing the length of the
effect window determines whether a unit-year observation is assigned to the treatment or the
control group and hence is not innocuous.
The model is econometrically identified if (i) each lag and lead j is observed in the outcome
6

Throughout the paper, we understand identification as the purely mechanical recovery of the coefficients

of interest, β, and not their causal interpretation.
7
In practice, an infinite effect window implies including the maximal number of leads and lags that can
be observed in the data.
8
Formally, let us adjust equation (5) in Borusyak and Jaravel (2017) to our notation for the case of an
P∞
P∞
infinite effect window: yit = j=−∞ βj 1[t = ei + j] + µi + θt + εit = j=−∞ (βj + λ · j)1[t = ei + j] +
(µi + λ · ei ) + (θt − λ · t) + εit . Dynamic treatment effects are therefore only identified up to the linear trend
P∞
λ · j. Equivalently, in the first difference distributed-lag representation, we can write ∆yit = j=−∞ γj 1[t =
P∞
ei + j] + θt + ∆εit = j=−∞ (γj + λ)1[t = ei + j] − λ + θt . The underidentification problem exists because
P∞
j=−∞ λ1[t = ei + j] = λ. However, with a limited effect window, the equation does not hold anymore
Pj̄
because j=j+1 λ1[t = ei + j] = 0 6= λ if t < ei − |j| + 1 or t > ei + j̄.

window [t, t̄] for at least one unit but not necessarily for the same unit, (ii) for at least one
observed endpoint (j or j̄) in t there is at least one other unit which is treated after (t + j)
or before (t − |j̄|). Condition (ii) guaranties that at least one endpoint is directly identified
from a comparison with a control group for which period t is outside of its effect window.
Condition (ii) is automatically satisfied in the presence of at least one never-treated unit.
Condition (i) identifies all other effects either from a direct comparison with a control group
or from an iterative comparison of effects. The identified endpoint allows backing out all other
treatment effects and all time fixed effects iteratively. This is equivalent to the econometric
identification in staggered treatment difference-in-differences designs. In Appendix B, we
present intuitive examples demonstrating how identification is achieved.

A Numerical Example

We illustrate the equivalence defined in Result 1 using the following
Example 1. We assume a panel that runs from t = 2000 to t̄ = 2010 and an effect window
from j = −3 to j̄ = 4. For unit i, the single event takes place at ei = 2005.

The left matrix shows how the event indicator bjit is binned at endpoints j and j̄ as
described in Remark 1. Moreover, the need for standardization (cf. Remark 3) becomes
visible as all row sums in the left matrix are equal to one. Binning also implies that if the
reform had happened on or before t = t − j̄ = 2000 − 4 = 1996 (rather than in t = 2005
11

as assumed in the example), bj̄it = b4it = 1 for all t from 2000 to 2010. In this case of an
always-treated unit, bj̄it = b4it is a constant and its effect is absorbed in the unit fixed effect
µi . By the analogous argument, events on or after t = t̄ + |j| = 2010 + 3 = 2013 imply
j

bit = b−3
it = 1 for all t from 2000 to 2010 whose effect is absorbed in µi . It therefore suffices
to know all events from time period t − j̄ + 1 = 1997 to t = t̄ + |j| − 1 = 2012 to estimate
the model, see Remark 2.
The following matrices visualize the explanatory variables of the distributed-lag model
applied to Example 1, again in levels and first-differences respectively.

Notice how the event study model with effects up to j̄ = 4 years after event and |j| = 3 years
before the event corresponds to a distributed-lag model with j̄ = 4 lags and |j| − 1 = 2 leads.
Also notice that the right matrix becomes a zero matrix if the event takes place on or before
1996 and on or after 2013. Hence, again only information of events between 1997 and 2012 is
necessary to estimate the model. The four matrices can also be used to verify the condition
that allow deriving our Result 1: bjit = di,t−j = ∆xi,t−j and bji,t−1 = di,t−j−1 = ∆xi,t−j−1
j

for j = −3 < j < j̄ = 4 as well as ∆bit = ∆b−3
it = −di,t−j−1 = −di,t−2 = −∆xi,t−2 and
∆bj̄it = ∆b4it = di,t−j̄ = di,t−4 = ∆xi,t−4 .

Generalization

In many applications, treatment may occur repeatedly and be of different intensities across
units and/or time. A common solution is to dichotomize treatment variables and use a
dummy variable that is switched on for large policy changes (see, e.g., Simon, 2016; Fuest
et al., 2018). However, the parameter estimates of such an artificial dichotomization are
12

hard to interpret both in magnitude and direction.9 Moreover, the dichotomization of the
treatment variable eliminates valuable information which could otherwise be used to identify
the magnitude of the effect.
In this section, we therefore propose a generalized event study approach which accommodates institutional set-ups where multiple events with known treatment intensity take place.
In particular, we show how effects of single events with varying treatment intensity, multiple
events of identical intensity and multiple events of different intensities can be estimated using
the full information of the treatment intensity.

3.1

Equivalence

Let us consider the general case where each unit i may be treated in any period t and
treatment intensity is known but may be different in each period. In this case, dit is no longer a
dummy variable, but indicates the direction and intensity of events for each i and t. Typically,
those kind of models are estimated in a distributed-lag model in first differences as given in
(7), where treatment status, xit , is defined recursively as xit = xi,t−1 + ∆xit = xi,t−1 + dit
with initial value xi,t−j̄ = 0.10
However, the event study approach can also accommodate this general case because the
equivalence Result 1 and Remarks 1 to 4 also hold in the general case. The only difference is
that the binned treatment variable bjit needs to be generated as in our alternative definition
(3) and not as in the more common definition (2).
By Remark 5, the event study coefficients in the standard case measure the average event
effect. These average reform effects might differ across units because of (i) heterogeneous,
unit-specific event effect for the same event, (ii) homogeneous treatment effect but different
events across units.11 The generalization removes (parts of) the latter sources of heterogeneity
9

To see this, consider the following case: each unit is treated once, there are two types of treatment: a

small reform dsit = 1 or a large reform d`it = 2; treatments are distributed randomly in time and treatment
effects are linear in the intensities of the reform. Ignoring small events and applying the standard event
dummy set-up yields dsit = 0, d`it = 1. In this case, units with small reforms become part of the the control
group although they respond to the reform. This induces a bias in the time fixed effects and thereby also
in the treatment coefficients. Depending on elasticity of the treatment effect with respect to the reform
intensity, the share of large vs. small reforms and the relative size of effect window to observation window,
it is possible that estimates in the model only using the large reforms can be larger, smaller or identical to
the model using all reforms. A possible fix for this ambiguity is to exclude units with small events from the
sample, in which case, the model is, however, estimated on a different and possibly selective sample.
10
Of course, distributed lag models in levels are suitable, too.
11
On an abstract level, the distinction between the two is somewhat arbitrary because you could interpret
an event of the same size happening in a different unit (or time) as a different event.

13

at the cost of an additional assumption, sacrificing parts of the non-parametric appeal of event
study designs. At the same time, estimates of the treatment effect become more precise if
the assumption is correct.

3.2

A Numerical Example

In the following, we provide a brief generic numerical example for the general case.
Example 2. We assume a panel that runs from t = 2000 to t̄ = 2010 and an effect window
from j = −3 to j̄ = 4. For individual i, one event of intensity di,2003 = 0.2 takes place in
2003, another event of intensity di,2004 = −0.1 in 2004 and yet another event of intensity
di,2006 = 0.3 in 2006; there are no event in the other years.
The following four matrices show the explanatory variables for the event study in levels bjit
and in first differences ∆bjit , as well as for the distributed-lag model in levels, xit = xit +∆xi,t−1
with initial value xi,t−j̄ = 0, and in first differences, ∆xit = dit :

Typical Cases and Applications

In this subsection we briefly discuss typical cases of the generalized event study design and
provide selected examples from recent applications in top five journals if there are any. Numerical examples for the special cases in 3.3.1 to 3.3.3 can be found in Appendix C.
3.3.1

Single Events of Varying Treatment Intensity

Consider the case where each unit receives one treatment, but treatment intensity di differs
across units (see Appendix C.1 for a numerical example). Note that the event study specification in levels looks like a regression of levels (yit ) on changes (di,t−j ). However, the identical
distributed-lag model in levels shows that the model is derived from an intuitive regression of
levels (yit ) on levels (xit ), i.e. on the cumulated changes di . Besides the classic event study,
this case is quite frequently applied as it fits an institutional setting where a shock at some
aggregate level hits units at a disaggregate level with different intensities (see, e.g., Alsan
and Wanamaker, 2018; Charles et al., 2018; Clemens et al., 2018; Goodman-Bacon, 2018).
3.3.2

Multiple Events of Identical Intensity

Consider the case where events of identical intensity take place repeatedly for a unit. In this
case, dit is an event dummy that takes the value 1 in any period where an event took place
and 0 in other periods. The binned treatment variable bjit is again generated by definition (3).
At the endpoints j and j̄, the binned treatment variable bjit is the backward cumulated event
dummy di,t+|j| and the forward cumulated event dummy di,t−j̄ , respectively (see Appendix
15

C.2 for a numerical example.) Note how the more common definition of the binned treatment
variable in definition (2) fails in this case.
In the case of multiple events, the parameter βj estimates the average effect of all single
and multiple events j periods after the event. Interestingly, the application of this model
is relative rare and mostly used in papers applying the original model used in the finance
literature (see, e.g. Dube et al., 2011, for an exception). However, many institutional set-ups
would fit the model well, such as hospital admissions or firm switches. Some studies only
focus on the first of potentially many events. Two things are important to note here. First,
depending on the proximity of multiple events pre-treatment and post-treatment effect might
overlap, which could lead to a bias. Second, following Remark 2, it is important to ensure
that no event happened outside the observation window for the dependent variable but inside
the window for the treatment indicator.
3.3.3

Multiple Events of Different Intensities and Direction

Last, we consider the most general case, described in Section 3.1. There are many settings
that fit this model, such as multiple tax changes or minimum wage hikes, and correspondingly
many applications. Traditionally, the corresponding models were framed as distributed lag
models rather than event study designs (Suárez Serrato and Zidar, 2016; Drechsler et al.,
2017; Fuest et al., 2018). A special case is when events have a different direction. Assume
that dit is a variable that takes the value 1 in periods with a “positive” treatment, −1 in
periods with a “negative” treatment and 0 in periods without a treatment. The parameter
βj estimates the average effect j periods after the event of all “positive” treatments and
– with reversed sign – all “negative” treatments. In other words, the effects of “positive”
and “negative” treatments are assumed symmetric with opposing signs. A typical example
would be the introduction of a new law in some period and the abolition of the law in some
later period, or the opening and closing of plants across regions. We are not aware of any
recent application of this case, while the model could be suitable for studying settings, such
as introduction of a policy that will eventually sunset, or the opening and closing of plants.

Conclusion

In this paper, we have made remarks about the standard event study design and its generalization. First, event study designs and distributed-lag models are equivalent and lead
to numerically identical parameter estimates after correct transformation of the parameters.
Second, binning of the endpoints of the effect window allows identification of both secular

16

time fixed effects and dynamic treatment effects even when no never-treated units are present.
Third, classic event study designs using dummy variables as event indicators can be naturally
generalized to models that account for multiple events of different intensities and signs.

Appendix A

Proof of Equivalence

In the following we show that the standard event study is numerically equivalent to the
distributed-lag model. We start by rewriting the equation (1) in first differences. The firstdifference model, which omits the first time period t and is defined for all t = t + 1, ..., t̄, is
given by
∆yit = yit − yi,t−1 =

j̄
X

βj ∆bjit + θt + ∆εit

j=j

where ∆bjit = bjit − bji,t−1 and where individual fixed effects µi cancel.
From (3), it follows that bjit = di,t−j and bji,t−1 = di,t−j−1 for j < j < j̄. Moreover, verify
j

that ∆bit = −di,t−j−1 and ∆bj̄it = di,t−j̄ . We can therefore rewrite for all t = t + 1, ..., t̄
∆yit =

j=j+1

where γj = βj − βj−1 and where we define ∆xit = dit . Hence the event study model in
differences is equivalent to a distributed-lag model in differences with j̄ lags and |j| − 1 leads.

19

The re-parametrization holds accordingly in levels for all t = t, ..., t̄ as
yit =

j̄
X

βj bjit

+ µi + θt + εit =

γj xi,t−j + µi + θt + εit

j=j+1

where treatment status xit is defined recursively as xit = xi,t−1 + ∆xit = xi,t−1 + dit with
initial value xi,t−j̄ = 0. The respective level equation is only defined up to a constant. We can
therefore set the initial treatment status xt−j̄ to an arbitrary value, e.g. xt−j̄ = 0. Adding a
constant c to xit and xi,t−1 does not affect ∆xit .

Appendix B

Identification

In the following, we present intuitive cases that demonstrate how identification is achieved.
The empirical model is described by equation (7), hence
∆yit = γ−1 di,t−1 + γ0 di,t + γ1 di,t+1 + θt + ∆εit .
There are no unit fixed effects and there is no constant in this regression, so no time fixed
effect has to be dropped for identification. Moreover, the cases in this appendix reveal
that identification is most easily studied in the first difference version of the distributed-lag
specification.
Consider the following seven cases with an effect window from j = −2 to j̄ = 1.
Case 1 (identified). Unit 1 is treated in t = 2, unit 2 is not treated, panel from t = 0 to
t̄ = 3.
The matrix of explanatory variables in Case 1 is given by

where t1, t2 and t3 are dummy variables for the three time periods 1, 2 and 3, respectively.
This is the example given in Borusyak and Jaravel (2017). The non-treated unit pins
down the time fixed effects, which thereby can be separated from the dynamic treatment
effects. The matrix of explanatory variables has full rank.

Clearly, the model in case 2 is not identified. Treatment and time effects cannot be separated.
This can be remedied if we shift the treatment of one unit by one year.
Case 3 (identified). Unit 1 treated in t = 2, unit 2 treated in t = 3, panel from t = 0 to

Case 3 demonstrates the main intuition behind the identification when binning endpoints.
The staggered treatment enables to pin down one time fixed effects for unit 2 and t = 1. If
t1 is identified, we can back out dt−1 for unit 1, then t2 for unit 2, and so on. For such an
iterative procedure it is necessary that we observe all event indicators in the data window,
they do not have to observable completely for one unit.

Again, we can iteratively separate event from time effects even though we do not observe a
full set of event effects for a single unit. However, it is important that we observe at least
one endpoint in a year t where the other unit is not treated.

Here, identification is not achieved. The matrix of explanatory variables has rank 5, as e.g.,
dt+1 = t1 −t3 −dt−1 . The effect one period before and one period after the event are identified
but the effect at the event is not observed for any unit.

Here, identification is not achieved. The matrix of explanatory variables has rank 5, as e.g.,
dt−1 = t2−dt+1 . Iterative identification is not possible. The reason is that only two endpoints
in the data window are observed in the same year (t = 2).
Case 7 (identified). Unit 1 treated in t = 0, unit 2 treated in t = 1, unit 3 treated in
t = 2, unit 4 not treated, panel from t = 0 to t̄ = 1.

All three dynamic effects are directly identified in direct comparison to a never-treated unit.
The matrix of explanatory variables is full rank. This case shows that the observation window
for the dependent variable can be shorter than the effect window.
