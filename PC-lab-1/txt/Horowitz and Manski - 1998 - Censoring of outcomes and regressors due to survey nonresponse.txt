Survey nonresponse makes identification of population parameters problematic. Except in special cases, identitication is possible only if one makes untestable assumptions
about the distribution of the missing data. However, nonresponse does not preclude

I. Introduction
Survey nonresponse is problematic for identification of population parameters. Whether nonresponse takes the form of particular missing items or
entire missing interviews, the only way to identify population parameters is to
make assumptions that determine the distribution of the missing data. A basic
problem of empirical analysis is that such assumptions are not testable.
Organizations conducting major surveys commonly release public-use data
liles that provide nonresponse weights and imputations to be used for estimating
population parameters. Weights are also used to compensate for planned
variation in sampling rates across strata of the population, but this usage is
distinct and not of concern here. Available survey data cannot validate the
distributional assumptions underlying weights and imputations but can be used
to determine the logically possible values of population parameters. Hence, the
asymptotic bias of estimates using weights and imputations can be bounded.
This paper shows how.
Our analysis is unabashedly conservative. Our objective is to characterize
the inferences that can be drawn in the absence of untestable assumptions
about the distribution of the missing data. Through this "worst-case" analysis,
wc hope to correct the imbalance that we perceive in the literature on survey
nonrcsponse. The literature has focused almost entirely on "best-case' scenarios
in which population parameters arc idcntilicd by imposing strong assumptions
on the distribution of the missing data. For example, the multiple imputati~m analysis of Rubin 11987)assumes that nollresponsc is ignorable. Likewise, the weights commonly provided with public-use data lilts are computed
under the ~1ssttmptio11 that tlonresponse is ignorable. As we see imlttel"S, it is
not enough for emrfirical researchers to know that imputations and weights
work well if specilicd assumptions hold. it is equally important to be able
to characterize the inferences that may be drawn without imposing these
assumptions. As emphasized in Manski t l995), conservative analysis of the
type performed here allo~vs the establishment of a domain of consensus among
researchers who may hold disparate beliefs about what assumptions are appropriate.
Throughout the paper, we assume that each member of the population is
characterized by a value of 1.1', x, w, -), where .1'e Y is an outcome of interest.
xe X and we W are covariate vectors, and - is a binary variable indicating
nonresponse. We focus on the problem of estimating conditional expectations of
the form E[,qtytJ.\'~ A], where ,qt'l is a specilied real-valued function of the
outcome .1' and A is a specilicd set of values of the covariates ,¢. We asstumc that
a random sample is drawn and that some observations of y and/or x are
censored by nonresponse. We let : = I indicate that t.1', .\') is fully observed and
.: = 0 that data are missing. The covariate vector w, which is always observed, is
used to compute weights and imputations.

in tile theoretical sections of the paper, we focus attention on the core
problem of idenIification and abstract from concerns of finite-sample inference.
Thus, we assume that features of the population identified by the censored
random sampling process are known rather than simply estimable. When we
speak of bias, we mean asymptotic bias. In several empirical examples, we
examine both the identification and the sampling aspects of inference.
To introduce themes, Section 2 considers the familiar case in which outcomes are censored but regressors are not. Here the identifiability of conditional expectations is transparent. We determine the probability limits
of estimates using weights and imputations and bound the asymptotic bias
of these estimates. We give an empirical example using data from the 1979
National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) to estimate employment
probabilities.
Section 3 examines joint censoring of the outcomes y and the regressors x. We
tind that this problem, which has not been studied previously, is formally
equivalent to the problem of identilication when only outcomes are censored,
except that the ~l.]'ectire censoring rate is higher than the actual one. We give an
empirical example using N LSY79 data to estimate unemployment rates.
Section 4 examines the case in which regressors are censored but outcomes are not. This problem, also not studied previously, is related to the
problem of identification fi'om contaminated data studied in Horowitz and
Manski (19951.
"rhe three problems examined in Sections 2 4
otltcome censoring, joint
censoring, and regressor censoring arc polar cases, in practice, researchers
often face mixed cases of greater complexity. Section 5 examines a type of mixed
censt~ring problem that arises commonly in panel data. Some sample members
arc never interviewed, and so have their outconics and all regressors censored.
()thers are interviewed in early waves of the survey but later drop out of the
panel, and so have their outcomes and a subset of regressors censored. We use
the NLSY79 data to illustrate.
The analysis in Sections 2 5 takes the administration of a survey as given.
Section 6 considers the situation of a survey organization which may act to
reduce the nonresponse rate. Here we characterize how increases in response
rates yield gains in identilication. Section 7 gives conclusions.
An important !inding of this paper is that estimates using weights arc
potentially more biased than are those using imputations. Estimates using
imputations take the observed data as given and specify logically possible
values for the missing data. Hence, imputation always yields a logically
possible value of the conditional expectation of interest, regardless of how
the imputed values are computed. Estimates using weights modify the
observed data. Wc show that, unless the weights are computed in particular
ways, weighting need not yield a logically possible value ot" the conditional
expectation.

2. Outcome censoring
We begin with the widely appreciated and easily understood problem of
outcome censoring. Only observations of y are missing. Realizations of x are
always observed, and z indicates whether or not y is observed.

2.1. hh'ntilication and the asymptotic bias of estimates
Consider the identifiability of E[g(y)lx~A]. As in Manski (1994, 1995), let
Ko-= inf:.~, gly) and K~ - s u p r ~ r g()'), where Y is the domain of v. Define
E[g(y)lA] = E[.qly)lx~ A] and observe that
E[,qIj')IA] = E[,qIy)IA, z = I]. P(z = I IA)

+ E[g(y)IA, z = 0]. PIz = OIA).

(1)

The censored sampling process identifies the mean E[g(ylIA, z = I] of the
uncensored observations, the response probability P(z = I IA), and the nonresponse probability P(z = OIA), but provides no information on the censored
mean E[g(y)IA, z = 0]. The last quantity lies in [Ko, K~]. Hence,

E[gIy)IA, : = I ] . P l : = I IA) + K,,.PI: = OIA) ~< E[.q()'tlA]
~<E[.q(yIIA,:= I ] . P l z =

11.41+ K t ' F ' I z = O I A ) .

12l

Thus, the available data do not identify E[¢/Iy)IA] but do restrict its valttc It)tin
interval of width (K t = K.). PI: = 01.4),
Let 0,, denote an estimate o1' E[,qly)l.,I] obtained in a sample o1' size N and let
0 be its probability limit. The bias o1' 0 (or asymptotic bias o1' 0~.) is
0 - E[OIy)IA]. By 121,
0 - E[,qIy~IA, z = !]. PIz = I IA) - Kt" PIz = OIA) ~< 0 - E[~I(Y)IA]

0 - E[t.I(Y)IA, z = I ] . P(- = I IA) - K,,. PIz = OIA). 131
An empirical researcher should restrict attention to estimates 0 that lie within
bound (21. if 0 lies outside the bound, an estimate with smaller bias is always
available, namely the bound endpoint nearer to 0.

2.2. Estimation using weights and i, qmtation.~"
2.2. I. II.~k,ights
Suppose that a randonl sample of size N has been drawn. Let N( I, A)denote
the sample members for whom - = 1 and .\'~,4. in weighting approaches to
estimation of E[,c/ly)l.4], each member of N( 1, .4)is assigned a weight .~(w) that

,I.L. ttorowit-. C.F. ,lhms/,i ,hmrnal olEconomeo'ics ,'¢4 ¢199& 37- 5,~'

may vary with the value of the observed covariate w. E[,q(y)IA] is estimated by
the weighted average

(4)

where N~.4 is the number of sample members in N ( l , A). The probability limit of
O,x, is 0 - E[s(w).g(y)lA, - = 13.
The public-use files of major surveys typically provide weights of the form
P(w)

s(w) =

P I w l - = 1)

=

P ( - = 1)

(5)

P(: = I Iw)

A simple example shows that estimates using such weights can asymptotically
lie outside the logically possible range of E[,q(r)lA]. Suppose that the nonresponse on )' is concentrated outside the set A , i.e., P ( : = I ) < 1
but
P ( : = I I A ) = I. Then bound (2) is degenerate at the value E[.q(y)lA, : = 1].
The weighted estimate lies outside the bound unless the estinaate equals
Eeg(y) IA, " = I ].
The basic ltaw in using weights of the form 15) is that the response probabilities P(: = I) and P(- = I [w) do not condition on the event [x ~ .4]. This flaw is
eliminated by use of weights of the forrn

Observe that Ko ~< E[g(y} ]A, w = r, z = 1] ~< K~, all c~: W. Hence, the righthand side of (71 lies within the bound (2). The right-hand side of (7) shows that
the estimate equals E[g(yl]A] if g(yt is mean-independent of z, conditional on
(A, w), i.e., if E[O(yI]A, w, z = 1] = E[oO'}IA, w, z = 0 ] . If this untestable
condition holds, nonresponse is said to be exogenous or ignorable.
If the covariates w used to form weights of the form (6) are statistically
independent of v, conditional on the event (A, z = 1}, then
0 = E[.qty)IA, z = 1]" E[s(w}lA, z = !]

Thus, the weighted estimate reduces to the unweighted one. This may explain
some of the reports by empirical researchers that their weighted and unweighted
estimates of population parameters are similar in magnitude.

0 ~ E[g(y)IA, - = I]. P(..- = I IA) + E[,q(y*)IA, - = 0]. P(- = O]A). (10)
Imputation uses the observed data as given and directly imposes a distribution
on the censored data. Hence, estimates using imputation always yield logically
possible values of E[g(y)IA]. Comparison of(lO} and (I) shows that an estimate
using imputation equals E[,q(y)IA] if E[,q(y)IA, .,- = O] = E[g(.v*)lA, -- = 0].
The available data do not reveal E[g(y}lA, ,- = 0], so this condition is unrestable.
it is common in imputation to assign each respondent i with missing outcome
data the imputed value y~' = Ely IA, u. = w+, - = I). The resulting estimate equals
E[g(y}IA] if ,q(.} is linear in v and nonresponse is exogcnous. In multiple
imputation, realizations of y~' are drawn at random from the distribution P(y IA,
w = w+, : = I}. The probability limit of an estimate obtained in this way equals
E[,q{y}iA] if ,v is statistically independent of :, conditional on (A, w). Rubin
(1987) shows how to measure sampling precision in this case.

2.3. An empirical example
This section presents an empirical example that illustrates some of the
theoretical results derived in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. We use the 1979 National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth to estimate the probability that a member of the
surveyed population is employed in 1991. The surveyed population consists of
individuals born between 1 January 1957 and 31 December 1964 who resided in
the United States in 1979. From 1979 on, the NLSY79 has yearly sought to
obtain interviews with a random sample of this population and with several
supplemental samples of special subpopulations (see Center for Human Resource Research, 1992). We use the random sample data here.
in this example, the outcome y indicates an individual's employment status at
the time of the 1991 interview. In the 1979 base year, the NLSY79 sought to
interview a random sample of 6812 individuals and succeeded in obtaining
interviews from 6111 of the sample members. Data on employment status in
1991 are available for 5556 of the 6111 individuals interviewed in the base year.
The remaining 555 are nonrespondents, some because they declined to be
interviewed in 1991 and some because they did not answer the employmentstatus question in their 1991 interviews. Table I presents these response statistics
and the fl'equencies with which different outcome values are reported.
The population nonresponse rate, which takes account of sample members
who were never interviewed, is P(: = 0) = 1256/6812 = 0.184. Researchers computing nonresponse rates to questions in the later years of longitudinal surveys
often condition on the event that a sample member was interviewed in the base
year. Let this event, which is always observed, be denoted BASE. Then the
ever-interviewed nOlllcsptnsc rate Ibr employment status in 1991 is
P(- = 01BASE) = 555./6111 = 0.091.
The empirical probability of employment among the 5556 individuals
who respond to the 1991 enaployment-status question is P l y = 21= = 1)
= 4332/5556 = 0.780. The censored probability of employrnent among nonrespondents is in [0, I]. Hence, 12) yields the following bounds on the population

or 0.636 ~< PCy=2) ~< 0.820 and 0.709 ~< PO,=21BASE} ~ 0.800.

2.3.1. Sampling cariation
The theoretical focus of this paper is identification, but empirical research
must also be concerned with sampling variation. The effects of sampling variation may be characterized by confidence intervals on the bounds. Consider
P(y=2}. The bound (2) may be rewritten as P(y=2, : = l ) ~ P ( y = 2 ) ~ < l
P(y =/=2, z = 1). The asymptotic standard errors of the estimates of the lower
and upper bounds are
-

St = ~tP{r = 2, z = I)EI - P(v = 2, z = I)]/N ti/2
Su = IP{), ~ 2, z = 1)[I - Ply :/: 2, z = I}]/N] t:-'.
where N =6812 is the sample size. A Bonferroni asymptotic joint confidence
region with level at least 95% is obtained by forming the intersection of
individual 97.5% regions. These regions are the point estimates of the lower and
upper bounds ± 12.24}St. and ± (2.24}Sv, respectively.
Substituting sample frequc~cies for population probabiti~.ics yields
P0' = 2. " = I} = 4332/6812 = 0.636.

P(y ~ 2 , - = I} = 1224/6812 = 0.180,
S~. = [10.636)(I ~ 0.636}( 1/6812}] ~ ~ = 0.0058,
St = [(0.180}{I ~ 0.180}(I/6812}] I/z = 0.0047.
So the estimated asymptotic joint Bonferroni 95% intervals are
0.623 ~< lower bound on P(y = 2} ~< 0.649,
0,810 ~< tipper bound on P ( y = 2) ~< 0.831.
Analogous computations conditioning on the event BASE yields
0.696 ~< lower bound on P(y = 21 BASE) ~< 0.722,
0.788 ~< upper bound on P(y = 21 BASE} ~< 0.81 I.
These conlidence intervals are much narrower than the widths of the estimated
bounds. Thus, identification is the donainant problem in inference on Ply= 2}
and P{y=21 BASE} from the NLSY79 data: sampling variation is a secondorder concern. This conclusion holds generally except in sittmtions where the

45

sample size is quite small, the response rate is very close to one, or substantial
prior information on the response process is available.
2.3.2. Weighted estimation
Finally, let us use the sampling weights provided with the NLSY79 public-use
file to estimate the population e m p l o y m e n t probability. Frankel, et al. (1983)

provide details on the construction of these weights, which are intended for
use in estimating population parameters from the 'full' NLSY79 data. The full
data consist of the random sample used here plus the supplemental samples
of special subpopulations. Nevertheless, researchers often apply the weights
to the random sample NLSY79 data. Insertion of the NLSY79 sampling weights
into (4) yields 0.796 as the weighted estimate of the population employment
probability.
The weighted estimate lies within the bounds and so gives a logically possible
value for P(y=2). The estimate implies that nonrespondents have higher employment probabilities than respondents. To see this, write
P(y = 2) = P(y = 2 l z = l)P(z = I) + Ply = 21z = 0)Plz = 0).
The raw NLSY79 data give P(z = 1)=0.816 and P(y= 2 Iz = I)=0.780. Using the
weighted estimate 0.796 as the value of Ply=2), the implied employment
probability for nonrespondents is P(y= 2 Iz =0)=0.867. Thus, a researcher who
applies the NLSY79 sampling weights implicitly assumes that the employment
probability for nonrespondents is 0.087 high,,:r than that for respondents. This
result contrasts with the finding of MaCurd~, el al. (1994) that individuals who
subsequently dropped out of the panel and individuals who dropped out and
later returned, respectively, had lower pre-drop out and post-return employment rates than individuals who never dropped out.

3. Joint censoring of outcomes and regressors

We now examine the joint censoring problem in which nonresponse on y is
accompanied by nonresponse on x. Thus, z= 1 now indicates that (y, x) is
observed and - = 0 that (y, x) is missing.
Joint censoring is a consequence of inlerview nonresponse, which occurs
when sample members refuse to participate in the survey or cannot be contacted
by survey administrators. Joint censoring also occurs if one wants to estimate
a conditional mean of the form E[.q(y)ly~ B], where B c Y. If data are missing
on the outcome y. they arc also missing on the conditioning event f~)'~B~,.
Although interview nonresponsc and conditioning on sets o1" outcomes are
common in survey research, the identification problem generated by joint
censoring has not previously been explored.

3.1. htentihcation
To determine the identifiability of E[g(y)IA], begin with (I). When (y, x) are
jointly censored, E[y(y)IA, z = O ] and P(z= I IA) are not identified. We can,
however, establish a sharp bound on P(z = 11A). Use Bayes Theorem to write
PIz = I I A ) =

P ( A I - = I)P(z = I)
P(AI: = I)P(: = I ) + P(AI: = O)P(: = 0 )

.

111)

The sampling process identifies P(A I z = 1), P(z = 1), and P(z = Ok but is uninformative about P(A I z = 0t. Setting P(A [ : = O) = I yields the sharp lower
bound on P(: = 1 [A), and P(AIz = O) = 0 yields the sharp upper bound. So
P~(:=

I IA) ~<

P(:=

I IA) ~< I,

1121

where
P~(: = I IA) =

P(AI= = I ) P ( = = l)
P(AI: = I)P(: = I ) + P(: = 0 )

.

113)

We call ! ~ ( : = I[A) the ¢ffectfl'e response prol~ahility and P~Iz=OIA)= !
- P ~ ( : = I IA) tile et.~bctfl'e nom'esl,onse prol, al, ility.
We can now obtain bounds on E[.q(yt IA]. E[g(y)IA. : = 0 ] is in [K,, K~] and
P(z= I IAI is in [I~1:= 11.4), I]. Hence, (11 implies the sharp bound
E[#(y)IA, - = I]' !~1: = I IAt + K,,. P~(- = OIA~
<~E[.(/IYtIA]~E[.qIyIIA,:= I ] ' ! ~ t : =

IIAI+K~'I~Iz=OIA).

114)

Bound 114t has the same form as 12), except thai the effective rc,'spc~nsc'• probability replaces the actual response probability. P~(.- = I 1.4t falls from P(: = I) to zero
as PIAI== I1 falls from one to zero. Thus, inference on E[g(y)IA] becomes
increasingly ditlicult as P I A I - = I) falls and is not feasible at all when
P I A I : . = I I = O . in this sense, joint censoring generates a qualitatively more
difficult inferential problem than does outcome censoring.

3.2. Esthnation using weights and hnputations
3.2. I. II'e~t~hts
When outcomes and regressors arc jointly censored, the weighted estimate 14t
remains computable with probability limit E[slw). #1)')IA, : = I ]. However, the
maximum asymptotic bias of the estimate is greater under joint censoring than
under outcome censoring. Under outcome censoring E[.qlylJA] lies within
bound 12), but under joint censoring E[.(/Iyl]A] lies within the wider bound t l4k
In Section 2, we saw that the weighted estimate asymptotically must lie within
bound (2) if the weights have form (6). Under joint censoring, however,
P(: = I IA)/P( - = 11.4, u') is generally not identitied, so weights of this form are

J.L. ttorowil:. (',F. AhmsM

not computable. An exception occurs if w is statistically independent of z,
conditional on A. Then (6) reduces to .slw)= I and we obtain the unweighted
estimate E[,q(y)IA, - = 1].
3.2.2. hnputation

When outcomes and regressors are jointly censored, the imputation estimate
19) considered in Section 2 is not computable because the composition of the
subsample N IA) is not known. In the present setting, each sample member who
does not report (y, x) may be assigned an imputed pair of values (.v*, x*). Then
E[g(y)IA] may be estimated by the sample average

3 . 3 . . . I n empirical example

In Section 2.3, we used NLSY79 data to estimate the probability that
a member of the surveyed population is employed in 1991. Now consider the
problem of inference on the ollicial unemployment rate as measured in the
United States by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This rate is the probability of
unemployment within the subpopulation of persons who are in the labor force.
When the 1991 employment status of an NLSY79 sample member is not
reported, data are missing not only on that individual's unemployment outcome
but also on his or her membership in the labor force. Thus, inference on the
ol|icial unemploy~ncnt rate poses a joint censoring problem.
Using the notation introduced in Section 2.3, the quantity of interest is
P [ y = 111'~ [I, 2]] or. perhaps, P l y = I IBASE. v~ '~1, 21]. The data in Table 1

48

.I.L. Horowit-. ('. F. 3hmski

.hmrnal O/E¢'onomet;'ics 84 f 199,~'1 3 7- 5,~'

show that the empirical unemployment rate among the individuals who respond
to the 1991 employment-status question and who report that they are in
the labor force is P [ y = I ly~[1, 2], z = 1] = 297/4629 =0.064. In addition,
PIz= 1)= 5556/6812=0.816 and P[y~ { 1, 211z= 1] =14332 + 297)/5556=0.833.
Hence, P,,I-z= l ly~ { I, 2}] =0.787. Bound (14) now yields the following bound
on the official unemployment rate:
10.064)(0.787) ~< P[y = l lye I 1, 21] ~< t0.064)(0.787t + 0.213
or 0.050~<P[y= I l y ~ l l , 21]~<0.263. Similar computations yield 0.057~<
P l y = II BASE, )'e [1, 2]] ~<0.164. Using the NLSY79 sampling weights yields
0.055 as the weighted estimate of the official unemployment rate.
As in the previous example, we estimate asymptotic joint Bonferroni confidence intervals for the bounds. The derivation is more lengthy than the previous
one, and so is given in an appendix. The results are
0.044 ~< lower bound on P [ y = I I )'~ { I, 2]] ~< 0.057,
0.251 ~< upper bound on Ply = I ly~ [1.2]] ~< 0.277,
0.050 < lower bound on P[y = !1 BASE, y~ ~1, 21] ~< 0.065,
0.153 ~< upper bound on Ply = I I BASE, ),~ '~1, 2]] ~< 0.178.
These conlidencc intervals arc much narrower than the widths o1"the estimated
bounds. Thus, identilication is again the dominant inferential problem.

" = 0 that x is missing, regrcssor censoring has not previously been studied.
4. i. hlentilication

When only x is censored, the sample data reveal P ( ) ' l - = 0 ) . Knowledge of
P(Yl- =01 implies restrictions on E[,q(yl IA, : = 0 ] that call be used to obtain new
bounds oll E[,qlY) lA].
T o begin, observe that
P(ylz = 0) =

P(yIA, z=O).p + P0,1,4, z = 0)-11 - p ) .

(19)

where p = P{A I z = 0) and where ,4 is the complement of A. Let t/, denote the set
of all distributions on Y. Proposition 1 of Horowitz and Manski 11995) shows
that, if p is known, (19} implies this sharp restriction on P(ylA, = = 0}:

=O)-(I-p)~],]/p, ~p¢'P~,.

Hence, we have this sharp p-dependent restriction o21 E[.q(y)IA. : = 0]:

E[.q(y) 1,4, : = 0] ~ G(t,) =- [.(,q(y) d~#, ~ ~ ~'(p)].

(21)

Let ,qo(p) = inf[ll: h~ G{p)] and ~,lt{P) - sup[h: h~ G(p)] be the sharp lower and
upper bounds on the value of E[,q(y)IA, : = 0]. Then 118) implies this sharp
p-dependent bound on E[.q(y)IA]:

.q(.)is the identity function ,q(y)=y and when ,q(') is the indicator function

The quantity p is not known, so bound t22) is not computable. The available
sharp bound on E[.qlyl IA] is obtained from 122)by minimizing the lower bound
over p~ [0, I] and by maximizing the upper bound over p. So we have this sharp

Regressor censoring yields all of the sample data available under joint
censoring of outcomes and regressors, so the present bound must be a subset of
the bound under joint censoring. The bound under regressor censoring typically
is a proper subset of the bound under joint censoring. In fact, E[g(y)IA] m a y
even be identified.
To show this, we consider the extreme case in which the observable distribution P(.vl: = 0) is degenerate, with all its mass at some value c e Y. Then

5. Total and partial joint censoring
It is easy to think of situations in which researchers face some mixture of the
three missing data problems analyzed in Sections 2 4. Many distinct cases
warrant attention and it is impossible to treat them all here. We shall examine
one important type of mixed censoring some respondents are missing data on
the outcome and all regressors, while others are missing data on the outcome
and a subset of the regressors.
Mixtures of total and partial joint censoring arc especially prevalent in
longitudinal surveys. Failure to interview sample members in the base year
generates joint censoring of outcomes and all regressors. Attrition of respondents who are interviewed in the base year generates censoring of outcomes and
a subset of regressors.

To illustrate mixed total and partial joint censoring, let the objective be to
learn the otlicial unemr~loyment rate in the subpopulation of white males. The
NLSYT) data reveal the race and sex ol'every respondent who is interviewed in
the base year, but data on employment status are available only for those
individuals who arc interviewed in 1991 and who report their employment
status then. "l'laus, ,4~ = lwhitc male ~, and A, = t~in the labor force in 1991 ~
The NLSY79 empioynaent-status data Ibr ever-interviewed white males are
presented in Table 2. These data show that the empirical unemploynaent rate
among white males is Ply = liar, A,.,za = I) = 114/(1900 + 114) = 0.0566. The
data in Tables I and 2 imply, by (34), that the effective response rate is
P~.lz2 = lIAr, A2) = 0.6781. Hence, the implied bound on the otlicial unemployment rate of white males is 0.038 <~ P(y = 1 IA ~, A 2) ~< 0.360. The estimate using
the NLSY79 sampling weights is 0.054. The present bounds are wider than those
found in Section 3.3 for the population unemployment rate because the additional conditioning here leads to a lower effective response rate.

6. The identifying power of increasing response rates

In the administration of surveys, it may be possible to increase interview
response rates through ettbrts to find sample members who initially cannot be

54

located or to obtain consent from sample members who initially refuse to be
interviewed. Item response rates may be increased through more intensive
interviewing of respondents or by finding other sources for the missing data. The
findings of Sections 2-5 imply that even relatively small levels of nonresponse
can seriously degrade identification. Increasing the response rate may substantially improve identifiability. This section characterizes these improvements for
the cases of outcome censoring and joint censoring.
Suppose that a survey is administered in two stages, say a and h, stage b being
an effort to increase response rates relative to stage a. Let z,, = 1 if a sample
member provides full information on (y, x) in stage a; z,, = 0 otherwise. Stage h
elicits responses only w h e n z,, = O. Let zh = I if z,, = I o r if the sample m e m b e r
responds fully in stage h; zh = 0 otherwise. Keeping with the conservative theme
of our earlier analysis, the bounds developed here use no unteslable assumptions
about the distribution of the data missing after stage h.

The lower bound on 7r~,¢(A)is larger than the value of 7r,..(A) given in (39a): hence.
increasing the marginal response rate from n,, to nh nccc. sa~lly improves the
identiliability of E[g(y)IA]. The width of the b o u n d decreases from
(Kl -- Kc~)[l - rc,,~(AI] to (Kl - K~)[I - nh,,(A)]. The magnitude of the reduction in width is illustrated in the next section.

6.3..4o empirical c:,¢anq~h,
To illustrate the lindings of Section 6.2, let us return to the example presented
in Section 3.3. There we considered the I'~roblem of inference on the official
unCml'~loymcnt rate in the entire population. The estimated bound was
0.050 ( P(.v = 11.4} <- 0.263, where A = [.vc ',1, 21]. "the cstimatcd asymptotic

0.044 ~< lower bound on P(.v= I IA) ..<.0.057,
0.251 ~< upper bound on P(y = I IA) ~< 0.277.
Thus, the width of the estimated bound is 0.213. The narrowest width within the
Bonferroni region is 0.194.
Now suppose that an additional stage of interviewing reduces the n u m b e r of
nonrespondents by half. from 1256 to 628. Then the data in Table I imply that

The lower and upper bounds on rct,,:IA) are
rc~,:dA I = (0.680H0.680 + 0.092t = 0.88 I,
rth,:u(A) = t0.680 + 0.092)/t0.680 + 0.184t = 0.893.
Using rch,:t.(A) as the effective response rate, which corresponds to setting
P(AI:,, = 0 , _-~,= 1 ) = 0 , yields the widest bounds at the reduced nonresponse rate. The estimate of the bound on P l y = IIAI is 0.056~<
P l y = liA) <~ 0.175.
The width of this bound is 0.119, whereas the width of the bound at the
stage-a nonresponse rate was 0.213. In contrast, the stage-a widths of the
Bonferroni confidence intervals on the lower and upper bounds are 0.013
and 0.026. Drawing an unlimited number of additional respondents at random
frem the population would decrease the widths of these already quite narrow
confidence intervals to zero, but would not improve the identifiability of the
ol]icial unemployment rate. However, converting just 628 nonrespondents into
respondents yields a major improvement in our ability to infer the unemployment rate.

7. Conclusion

Survey nonresponse makes identification of population parameters
I'~roblematic but does not preclude identilication of bounds on pararneters.
]'his paper has obtained bounds under several I'orms of nonrcsporlse, without
using untestable assumptions about the distribution ol" the rnissing data.
Empirical illustrations have demonstrated that nonresponse typically makes
identilication the dominant problem in inference, with sampling warialion a
lesser concern. Efforts to increase response rates can substantially improve
identilication.
in applied research, it is customary to achieve identification in the presence ol'
survey nonresponse through the use of weights, imputations or, more generally,
models of the nonresponse process that place a priori restrictions on the relevant
distributions in the nonresponding subpopulation. These restrictions usually
are not testable. Corresponding to each point within the bounds identilied by
the data alone, there is a model that uniquely identilies that point. Thus, there
are inlinitely many mutually exclusive models that are consistent with the
identiliable features of the data and the data cannot be used to determine which,
if an), of the models is correct. This does not necessarily mean that models
should not be used, but it is important to understand the ambiguity that is
inherent in any effort to use a model to achieve identilication in the presence of
nonresponse. The results presented in this paper arc aimed at promoting such an
understanding.
