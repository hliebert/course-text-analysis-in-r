Comment: Demystifying Double
Robustness: A Comparison of Alternative
Strategies for Estimating a Population
Mean from Incomplete Data

Throughout, we use the same notation as in the paper.

INTRODUCTION

We congratulate Drs. Kang and Schafer (KS henceforth) for a careful and thought-provoking contribution
to the literature regarding the so-called “double robustness” property, a topic that still engenders some confusion and disagreement. The authors’ approach of focusing on the simplest situation of estimation of the
population mean μ of a response y when y is not observed on all subjects according to a missing at random (MAR) mechanism (equivalently, estimation of
the mean of a potential outcome in a causal model under the assumption of no unmeasured confounders) is
commendable, as the fundamental issues can be explored without the distractions of the messier notation
and considerations required in more complicated settings. Indeed, as the article demonstrates, this simple
setting is sufficient to highlight a number of key points.
As noted eloquently by Molenberghs (2005), in
regard to how such missing data/causal inference
problems are best addressed, two “schools” may be
identified: the “likelihood-oriented” school and the
“weighting-based” school. As we have emphasized
previously (Davidian, Tsiatis and Leon, 2005), we prefer to view inference from the vantage point of semiparametric theory, focusing on the assumptions embedded in the statistical models leading to different
“types” of estimators (i.e., “likelihood-oriented” or
“weighting-based”) rather than on the forms of the estimators themselves. In this discussion, we hope to complement the presentation of the authors by elaborating
on this point of view.

SEMIPARAMETRIC THEORY PERSPECTIVE

As demonstrated by Robins, Rotnitzky and Zhao
(1994) and Tsiatis (2006), exploiting the relationship
between so-called influence functions and estimators
is a fruitful approach to studying and contrasting the
(large-sample) properties of estimators for parameters
of interest in a statistical model. We remind the reader
that a statistical model is a class of densities that could
have generated the observed data. Our presentation
here is for scalar parameters such as μ, but generalizes readily to vector-valued parameters. If one restricts attention to estimators that are regular (i.e., not
“pathological”; see Davidian, Tsiatis and Leon, 2005,
page 263 and Tsiatis 2006, pages 26–27), then, for
a parameter μ in a parametric or semiparametric sta for μ based on indetistical model, an estimator μ
pendent and identically distributed observed data zi ,
i = 1, . . . , n, is said to be asymptotically linear if it

The function ϕ(z) is the influence function of the es. A regular, asymptotically linear estimator

with influence function ϕ(z) is consistent and asymptotically normal with asymptotic variance E{ϕ 2 (z)}.
Thus, there is an inextricable connection between estimators and influence functions in that the asymptotic behavior of an estimator is fully determined by
its influence function, so that it suffices to focus on
the influence function when discussing an estimator’s

properties. Many of the estimators discussed by KS are
regular and asymptotically linear; in the sequel, we refer to regular and asymptotically linear estimators as
simply “estimators.”
We capitalize on this connection by considering the
problem of estimating μ in the setting in KS in terms of
statistical models that may be assumed for the observed
data, from which influence functions corresponding to
estimators valid under the assumed models may be derived. In the situation studied by KS, the “full” data
that would ideally be observed are (t, x, y); however,
as y is unobserved for some subjects, the observed data
available for analysis are z = (t, x, ty). As noted by
KS, the MAR assumption states that y and t are conditionally independent given x; for example, P (t = 1|
y, x) = P (t = 1|x). Under this assumption, all joint
densities for the observed data have the form
(2)

p(z) = p(y|x)I (t=1) p(t|x)p(x),

where p(y|x) is the density of y given x, p(t|x) is the
density of t given x, and p(x) is the marginal density
of x. Let p0 (z) be the density in the class of densities
of form (2) generating the observed data (the true joint
density).
One may posit different statistical models by making
different assumptions on the components of (2). We focus on three such models:
I. Make no assumptions on the forms of p(x) or
p(t|x), leaving these entirely unspecified. Make
a specific assumption on p(y|x), namely, that
E(y|x) = m(x, β) for some given function
m(x, β) depending on parameters β (p × 1). Denote the class of densities satisfying these assumptions as MI .
II. Make no assumptions on the forms of p(x) or
p(y|x). Make a specific assumption on p(t|x)
that P (t = 1|x) = E(t|x) = π(x, α) for some
given function π(x, α) depending on parameters α
(s × 1). Here, we also require the assumption that
P (t = 1|x) ≥ ε > 0 for all x and some ε. Denote
the class of densities satisfying these assumptions
as MII .
III. Make no assumptions on the form of p(x), but
make specific assumptions on p(y|x) and p(t|x),
namely, that E(y|x) = m(x, β) and P (t = 1|x) =
E(t|x) = π(x, α) ≥ ε > 0 for all x and some ε for
given functions m(x, β) and π(x, α) depending on
parameters β and α. The class of densities satisfying these assumptions is MI ∩ MII .

All of I–III are semiparametric statistical models in
that some aspects of p(z) are left unspecified. Denote
by m0 (x) the true function E(y|x) and by π0 (x) the
true function P (t = 1|x) = E(t|x) corresponding to
the true density p0 (z).
Semiparametric theory yields the form of all influence functions corresponding to estimators for μ under each of the statistical models I–III. As discussed in
Tsiatis (2006, page 52), loosely speaking, a consistent
and asymptotically normal estimator for μ in a statistical model has the property that, for all p(z) in the class

totic variance of μ
If model I is correct, then m0 (x) = m(x, β) for
some β, and it may be shown (e.g., Tsiatis, 2006, Section 4.5) that all estimators for μ have influence functions of the form
(3)

m0 (x) − μ + ta(x){y − m0 (x)}

for arbitrary functions a(x) of x. If model II is correct,
then π0 (x) = π(x, α) for some α, and all estimators for
μ have influence functions of the form

h(x); see below.

in (4) of KS follows from (4) with h(x) = −E[y{1 −

in (4) to be a constant, then, using the fact that the expectation of the square of (4) is the asymptotic variance of the estimator, one may find the “best” such
constant minimizing the variance as h(x) = −E[y{1 −

Doubly robust (DR) estimators are estimators that
are consistent and asymptotically normal for models
in MI ∪ MII , that is, under the assumptions of model I
or model II. When the true density p0 (z) ∈ MI ∩ MII ,
then the influence function of any such DR estimator
must be equal to (3) with a(x) = 1/π0 (x) or, equivalently, equal to (4) with h(x) = −m0 (x). Accordingly,
when p0 (z) ∈ MI ∩MII , that is, both models have been
specified correctly, all such DR estimators will have
the same asymptotic variance. This also implies that,
if both models are correctly specified, the asymptotic
properties of the estimator do not depend on the methods used to estimate β and α.
KS discuss strategies for constructing DR estimators, and they present several specific examples:
BC-OLS in their equation (8); the estimators beμ

SRR . The reand Robins (2005), which we denote as μ
sults for these estimators under the “Correct-Correct”
scenarios (MI ∩ MII ) in Tables 5–8 of KS are consistent with the asymptotic properties above. We note that
π -cov is not DR under MI ∪ MII because of the addiμ
tional assumption that the mean of y given π must be
equal to a linear combination of basis functions in π .

to whether or not a DR estimator is AIPW, but, rather,
are a consequence of forms of the influence functions
of estimators under MI or MII . In particular, under
model II, it follows that the above estimators have influence functions of the form (4) with h(x) equal to (9)
h(x) = −{γ ∗ + m(x, β ∗ )}, where γ ∗ and β ∗ are

the limits in probability of γ and β,
features determining performance of these estimators
when model II is correct are how close γ ∗ + m(x, β ∗ )
is to m0 (x) and how α is estimated, where maximum
likelihood is the optimal choice. In fact, this perspective reveals that, for fixed m(x, β), using ideas similar
to those in Tan (2006), the optimal choice of γ is as in

Similarly, under model I, the influence functions of

of 
a (x) and how β is estimated through the choice of
A(x, β).
We may interpret some of the results in Tables 5,
6 and 8 of KS in light of these observations. Under the “π -model Correct–y-model Incorrect” scenario
BC-OLS , μ
WLS and μ
SRR show some non(MII ∩ MIc ), μ

are likely attributable to differences in m(x, β ∗ ). Under
the “π -model Incorrect–y-model Correct” (MI ∩MIIc ),
a (x) but use differall three estimators share the same 

dictated entirely by the choice of A(x, β). The poor
SRR can be understood from this perperformance of μ
spective: “β” for this estimator is actually β in the
model m(x, β) used by the other two estimators concatenated by an additional element, the coefficient of
i−1 . The A(x, β) for μ
SRR thus involves a design maπ
i , consistent with the
trix that is unstable for small π
comment of KS at the end of their Section 3.
In summary, we believe that studying the performance of estimators via their influence functions can
provide useful insights. Our preceding remarks refer to
large-sample performance, which depends directly on
the influence function. Estimators with the same influence function can exhibit different finite-sample properties. It may be possible via higher-order expansions
to gain an understanding of some of this behavior; to
the best of our knowledge, this is an open question.
BOTH MODELS INCORRECT

The developments in the previous section are relevant in MI ∪ MII . Key themes of KS are performance
of DR and other estimators outside this class; that is,
when both the models π(x, α) and m(x, β) are incorrectly specified, and choice of estimator under these
circumstances.
One way to study performance in this situation is
through simulation. KS have devised a very interesting
and instructive specific simulation scenario that highlights some important features of various estimators.
In particular, the KS scenario emphasizes the difficulties encountered with some of the DR estimators when

of MI ∪ MII , may compensate for this restriction by
yielding more robust performance outside MI ∪ MII ;
further study along these lines would be interesting. An
alternative tactic for searching outside MI ∪ MII may
be to consider the form of influence functions (5) for
estimators valid under MI ∩ MII . For instance, a “hybrid” estimator of the form
