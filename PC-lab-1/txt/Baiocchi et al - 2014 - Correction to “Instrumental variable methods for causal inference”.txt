Correction to “Instrumental variable
methods for causal inference”
We would like to make a correction to the paper titled “Instrumental variable methods for causal inference” in Statistics in Medicine. In Section 5.2, the last equality in equation (8) follows only if the IV Z is
independent of unmeasured confounders without conditioning on the measured covariates 𝐗. If instead,
(IV-A3) holds but the IV Z may depend on the vector of measured covariates 𝐗, i.e., Z is independent of
(D1 , D0 , Y 1,1 , Y 1,0 , Y 0,1 , Y 0,0 )|𝐗, then the last equality in (8) should be replaced by
∫ [E(D|Z = 1, X = x, 𝐗 = 𝐱) − E(D|Z = 0, X = x, 𝐗 = 𝐱)]f (𝐱)d𝐱
∫ [E(D|Z = 1, 𝐗 = 𝐱) − E(D|Z = 0, 𝐗 = 𝐱)]f (𝐱)d𝐱

,

(⋆)

where 𝐗 denotes the vector of measured covariates that needs to be conditioned on for (IV-A3) to hold
and X denotes the covariate for which we are examining its distribution among the compliers (note that
X need not be included in 𝐗). The estimation procedure in the sentence below (8) and the simplification
of (7) for a binary characteristic X (which appears in the second sentence below (8)) should be modified
accordingly based on (⋆). Also, in Section 14, the code for the proportion of compliers that are low birth
weight should be modified based on (⋆), or more simply, the following formula for E(X|C = co) from
[1] can be used:
E(X|C = co) =

E[𝜅i Xi ]
,
E[𝜅i ]

where
𝜅i = 1 −

Di (1 − Zi )
(1 − Di )
−
.
1 − P(Zi = 1|𝐗i ) P(Zi = 1|𝐗i )

Using this formula, the code for the proportion of compliers that are low birth weight is
# Proportion of compliers that are low birth weight (<1500g)
# Let bold.X.mat denote the matrix of covariates that needs to be conditioned
# on for (IV-A3) to hold
z.given.X.model=glm(z˜ bold.X.mat,family=binomial)
prob.z.equal.1.given.X=predict(z.given.X.model,type="response")
kappa=1-d*(1-z)/(1-prob.z.equal.1.given.X)-(1-d)/prob.z.equal.1.given.X
prop.compliers.low.birth.weight=mean(low.birth.weight*kappa)/mean(kappa)
