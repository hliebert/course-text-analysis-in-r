The purpose of this paper is to investigate the identifiability of duration models with multiple
spells. We prove that the results of Elbers and Ridder (1982) and Heckman and Singer (1984)
can be generalized to multi-spell models with lagged duration dependence. We also prove that
without lagged duration dependence, the identification result does not depend on moment
conditions or tail conditions on the mixing distribution. This result is in contrast to Ridder's
(1990) result for single-spell models.

1. INTRODUCTION
For a duration model, one can ask whether the data has anything to say about the
distribution of the unobserved heterogeneity and the form of the time dependence. Elbers
and Ridder (1982) and Heckman and Singer (1984) provided a partial answer to this
question by establishing that proportional hazard models with proportional unobserved
heterogeneity of unknown distribution (mixed proportional hazard models) are identified
if auxiliary assumptions on either the first moment of the mixing distribution or on the
tail behaviour of the mixing distribution are maintained (see Heckman (1991) for a review
of these and other identification results).
This paper generalizes the results of Elbers and Ridder (1982) and Heckman and
Singer (1984) to models with multiple spells. Multiple spells can occur because there are
multiple observations of durations of the same kind. In labour economics, for example,
there may be data on more than one spell of unemployment for each individual (Heckman
and Borjas (1980)). In marketing, there may be data for more than one inter-purchase
time of a given product for each household (Jain and Vilcassim (1991) and Vilcassim
and Jain (1991)). In these cases, it may be reasonable to assume that the hazard is the
same for all spells for the same individual. In other cases, each individual may have
spells that are related, but not exactly of the same kind. In demography, for example,
there may be observations of the time from marriage to first birth, from first birth to
second birth, from second birth to third birth, etc. (Heckman, Hotz and Walker (1985)).
Under these circumstances, it may be desirable to specify different hazards for the different
events. The main problem with identification of multispell models is that if the model
has "lagged duration dependence', then one of the regressors (lagged duration) will be
endogenous, and the results of Elbers and Ridder (1982) and Heckman and Singer (1984)
will not apply.
In a recent paper, Ridder (1990) demonstrated (as a special case) that the identification results of Elbers and Ridder (1982) and Heckman and Singer (1984) depend

crucially on the assumptions made on the mixing distribution. Without normalizing
assumptions like the moment condition of Elbers and Ridder (1982), or the tail condition
of Heckman and Singer (1984), the model is not identified. A special case of this result
was also given in Heckman and Singer (1985), page 64. In the analysis of multiple spells,
we find that if there is no lagged duration dependence and if the unobserved component
(for a given individual) is the same for different spells, then it is not necessary to make
any assumptions about the mixing distribution. This result is in contrast to Ridder's result
for single spell models.
2. MULTI-SPELL DURATION MODELS.
Suppose that for covariate x there is a positive random variable, T, with hazard function
given by
h(t; x, 0) = Z'(t)4)(x)0

(1)

where Z is the integrated hazard (assumed to be differentiable), and 0 is an unobserved
random component which is assumed to have a distribution G which does not depend
on x.' Elbers and Ridder (1982) proved that the model given by (1) is identified if the
following three assumptions are satisfied (Heckman and Singer (1984) prove identification
under slightly weaker assumptions):
Assumption ER 1. is non-negative with distribution function G, and E[ 0]

1.

Assumption ER2. The function Z defined on [0, oo) can be written as the integral
of a non-negative function qi.
Assumption ER3. The support of x, S, is an open set in 91k, and the function 4) is
defined on S and is non-negative, differentiable and non-constant on S. Furthermore,
4)(xo) = 1 for some fixed xoe S.
Assumption ER3 rules out the case in which all of the covariates are discrete. In an
appendix to their paper Elbers and Ridder show that Assumption ER3 can be replaced
by the weaker assumption:
Assumption ER3. There are two points in the support of x, xo and xl, such that
4 (xo) $ 4 (xl). Furthermore 4 (xo) = 1.
It is clear that a re-scaling of Z, 4)and 0 in (1) can lead to the same distribution of
T, so normalizations like E[0] = 1 and 4)(xo) = 1 cannot be avoided. More surprisingly,
Ridder (1990) proved that if no assumptions are made on the distribution of 0, then (1)
is only identified up to power transformations of Z and 4)(and "power-like" transformations of G). Ridder's result is a consequence of the fact that if ?t(s) is the Laplace
transform of a positive random variable, then So (sc) with 0 < c < 1 is the Laplace transform
of a positive random variable 0 with an infinite mean. In the model given by (1) the
survivor function is _T6(Z(t)0(x)). Hence, if we take Z and 4)to power l/c and replace
o by 0 in (1), we obtain an observationally equivalent mixed proportional hazard model.
The moment condition of Elbers and Ridder and Heckman and Singer's tail condition
can be thought of as normalizing conditions that fix c.
1. Throughout the paper, it will be assumed that the distributions of the variable of interests are
non-defective.

DURATION MODELS

In this paper, we consider a panel data version of (1) in which there are two
observations for each realization of 0. 0 then corresponds to a random effect in analysis
of panel data. First, consider a model without covariates. Assume that conditional on 0,
T1 and T2 are independent with hazards
and

hl(t)=Z'(t)0

h2(t)=Z2'(t)O.

With this specification of the hazard functions, the joint survivor function of T1and T2is
00

S(tl, t2) =

e-OZ1(tl)Z2(t2)

dG(O) = ?T(Z1(tl) +

Z2(t2)),

(2)

0

where _ is the Laplace transform for 0. This model is identified.
Theorem 1.

Suppose that for i = 1, 2, zi is differentiable and strictly increasing, then

Zl, Z2, and G are identified except for a common normalizing (scaling) constant.

Proof

By differentiation of (2),
aS( tl, t2)/at2 ?T'(Z1(tJ) + Z2(t2))Z2( t2)
aS(tl, t2)/atl ?'(Z1(tJ)+Z2(t2))Z'1(t)

Z2( t2)
Z'1(t)(

Let k = Z'(to) 1 for some fixed tofor which Z' > 0. From (3), we can then get kZ(t2),
and by taking the ratio of (3) evaluated at (to, t2) and (t, t2) for some t2 for which Z2> 0,
we can get kZ'(tl).
By integration we get
kZ1(t) + cl and

kZ2(t) + c2

where we can determine cl and c2 by Z1(0) = Z2(0) = 0. This completes the proof.
Theorem 1 states that in a panel setting, it is not necessary to make any assumptions
about the mixing distribution. Moreover, covariates are not necessary for identification
of the model. This implies that the result in Theorem 1 can be extended to cover
identifiability of a model in which the hazards are
h1(t; x) =Z'(t; x)0

and

h2(t; x) =Z2(t; x)0,

and where the distribution of 0 may depend on x. With this specification of the hazard
functions, the joint survivor function of T1 and T2 is
S(tl , t2;

X) =

e-OZI(tl; x)-Z2(t2;

x)dG( O; x).

(4)

By applying Theorem 1 conditional on x, we see that Z1(t; x), Z2(t; x) and G(O; x) are
identified up to scale.
The reason why the model given in (2) is identified without conditions on the
distribution of 0 while the model in (1) is not, is that the (Z1(tJ)+Z2(t2))l/c cannot be
written as Z1( tl) + Z2( t2) (unless c = 1). The comment in the paragraph following Assumption ER3' does therefore not apply to (2). By the same argument, the partly additive
model h(t; x, 0) = (Z'(t) + +(x))0 is identified in a single spell context.
Notice that in Theorem 1, it is not assumed that the baseline hazard is the same in
the two spells. For some applications, it would be natural to impose this additional
restriction.

The crucial assumptionin the precedingdiscussionis that 0 entersmultiplicatively
on the hazard and that 0 is the same for each of the durations. Depending on the
application,the last assumptionmay or may not be reasonable. We will thereforenext
investigatethe identifiabilityof mixed proportionalhazardmodels for which 0 is allowed
to be differentin the specificationof T1 and T'2:

where G is the joint distributionof (01, 02).
If the assumptionsof Elbersand Ridder(1982), or Heckmanand Singer(1984), are
satisfied, then Zl, Z2, 41, &2 and the marginaldistributionsof G can be identifiedby
consideringthe marginaldistributionsof (Tl, T2). It then follows from the uniqueness
of the multi-dimensionalLaplacetransformthat G is identifiedas well. We have thus
established:
Theorem 2.

Let the conditional distribution of (T1, T2) given x be given by (5). If,

for i = 1, 2, (Oi,4i, Zi) satisfiesthe assumptionsof ER1, ER2 and ER3' then 41, &2, Z1,
Z2

and G are uniquely identified (except for the scale normalizations discussed earlier).

It is clearthatthe modelgivenin equation(5) is not identifiedwithoutthe assumption
that the mixing distributionhas finite mean (or satisfiesa tail-conditionlike the one in
Heckmanand Singer (1984)). The reason for this is exactlythe same as the reason that
(1) is not identifiedwithoutsuch an assumption.
We next turn to extensionsof (5) that allow the specificationfor the hazardin the
second spell to depend on the outcome of the first spell. This effect is usually called
"laggeddurationdependence".Modelswithlaggeddurationdependencehavebeen used
by Heckmanand Borjas(1980) and Heckman,Hotz, and Walker(1985), among others.
In these applications, it is usually assumed that the effect of the lagged duration is
multiplicativein the hazardin which case the joint density of (T1, T2)becomes:

Conditionalon Tl, 02 is not independentof x, so we can not use the resultsof Elbers

To prove the remainder of the theorem, note that the assumption that E[0102] = 1
can be replaced by E[0102] <oo and Z2(t*) = 1 for some known t* without changing the
content of the assumption. We will prove the theorem under the latter assumption.
Since q5jand Z1 are continuous, we can define a continuous function x(tl) such that
z1(tj)4j(x(tj)) is constant on an open set A containing t*. Let t', and t' belong to A
and let =x(t 1) and x=x(t'l), then

This, and the assumption that h(t*) = 1, determine h on A. Next observe that
t2

T(tl, s; x)ds = Zi(tl)4l(x)E[Ole-o1Zl(tl)k1(x)(-

e02Z2(t2)-2(X)h(tj)

0

so we can solve for
E [ 0le-olzl(tl)01(x)

e-02z2(t2)02(X)h(tl)]

Letting t2= t2*be fixed (recall that Z2(t*) = 1), and having already identified Z1, q1,
and h (h so far only on A), we can identify
K (s1,

S2) =

(8)
2

E[j01e-0s1e-2s2]

on an open set. Since K is real analytic, it can be extended to all of 9+. From knowledge
of K, we can solve for Z2 by fixing t, and x in (8) above (t1 E A). Likewise we can solve
for h on all of 9A+by fixing t2= t* and fixing x.
To identify G, we integrate K with respect to s, to get
0

K(r1, s2)d-q= E[e-81sie-82s2],
SI

which is the Laplace transform of G. Hence G is identified. This completes the proof.

I

The role played by conditions (1) and (2), in Theorem 3 is clear. To interpret
condition (3) note that the assumptions that E[01] = 1, h(t*) = 1 and E[0J 02] < ? reduce
to assuming E[ 01]<oo and E[ 0102]<oo. The rest are normalizations.
