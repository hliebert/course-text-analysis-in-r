Do ExplicitWarnings Eliminatethe Hypothetical Bias in
ElicitationProcedures?
Evidence from Field Auctions for Sportscards
By JOHNA. LIST*
The goal of environmentalpolicy is to protect
the well-being of humans and the ecosystems
vital to human existence. Because benefit-cost
analyses are now requiredat the federal level,
and increasingly at the state level, much attention has been paid to the development of practical, credible approaches for estimating the
benefits and costs of environmentalprograms.
Although policy makershave a good handle on
measuringthe explicit costs associated with increased environmental protection, at present
several disparate approaches are utilized to
measure economic values of environmental
goods and services. Arguably the most contentious of these approachesis the ContingentValuation Method (CVM), which allows the
researcher to measure the total value of the
commodity in question (see Peter A. Diamond
and JerryA. Hausman's [1994] criticalreview).
Chief amongst these concems is whetherhypothetical bias is inherentin CVM responses.
Some recently published studies provide evidence that suggests importantdifferences exist
between responses from real and hypothetical
valuation questions.1 Recognizing this shortcoming, researchershave adoptedboth ex ante
and ex post techniques to overcome hypothetical bias. Although these attemptshave not been
completely successful in dealing with hypothetical bias, Ronald G. Cummings and Laura 0.
Taylor (1999) presentevidence from laboratory

experimentsthat indicateshypotheticalbias can
be overcome by an appropriateex ante design
they refer to as a "cheap talk" scheme.2 The
underlyingpremisebehind Cummingsand Taylor's design is that by making hypotheticalbias
an integral part of the contingent value questionnaire, the researcher can induce truthtelling. Their cheap talk experiments validated
this conjecture,as hypotheticalbias was effectively eliminated in open referenda for three
public goods.
The goal of this study is to take the cheap talk
design to a well-functioning marketplace and
auction off sportscards. Besides providing a
field validity test, I also explore the generality
of Cummingsand Taylor's findingsby examining whether experience with the good in question affects hypotheticalbias throughinclusion
of both card dealers and nondealersin the field
auctions. The theory of value formation suggests thatexperiencedbiddersmay not be easily
swayed by the cheap talk design as they have a
well-structuredpreferenceorderingfor the good
in question and should thereforerely on few, if
any, external signals when formulating their
value.
I. ExperimentalDesign
This study complementsCummingsand Taylor (CT hereafter)by taking their methodology
to the field. They designed a classroom experiment with student participants to examine
whethera cheap talk scriptdescribingthe nature
of hypothetical bias can eliminate the gap between intentionsand actions.3Their experiment
was designed to satisfy some of the contingent
valuation criteria as proposed by the National

LIST:HYPOTHETICAL
BIAS IN ELICITATIONPROCEDURES

Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
(NOAA) blue-ribbonpanel-e.g., dichotomous
choice questions in a referendum format. CT
find that althougha short cheap talk script does
not mitigate hypotheticalbias, a longer version
does eliminate hypotheticalbias.
The currentstudy extends CT's work in numerous dimensions. First, I use subjects of all
ages in an actual marketplaceratherthan students in the lab.4 Another significantdifference
is that I have two heterogeneousgroups of subjects-those that have market experience with
the good (sportscard dealers) and those that
have limited experience (nondealers).SA third
disparity is that I gather data via one-on-one
personal interviews, whereas CT gather data
in a group setting. Since CVM questions oftentimes involve complex scenarios that require careful explanation, close control of the
pace of the interview is necessary. For this,
and other important reasons, the method of
choice for most CVM surveys is one-on-one
in-person interviews (see, e.g., Robert Cameron Mitchell and Richard T. Carson, 1989).
These three features of my field experiments
provide increased realism, making the valuation environment as close as possible to most
CVM and market environments.
A further difference between the current
study and CT's is that I use an incentivecompatible second-price sealed-bid auction instead of the dichotomous choice referendum
design, as advocatedby the NOAA panel. Since
both allocationmechanismsare theoreticallyin4As elaborated on in List and David Lucking-Reiley
(2000), field experimentsare a relatively new innovationto
gatherunique data.List and Lucking-Reiley(2000) ran 328
auctions at sportscardshows to analyze the efficacy of the
uniform-price auction when participants have multi-unit
demand. List and Shogren (1998a) employ experimental
auctions of sportscardsat card shows to investigate related
contingent valuation questions; the present paper employs
the same card-show methodology as these papers. Field
experiments present a trade-off:they give up some of the
controls of a laboratoryexperiment(such as induced valuations) in exchange for increased realism, and therefore
provide a useful middle groundbetween the tight controlsof
the laboratoryand the vagaries of completely uncontrolled
field data.
5Given the proliferationof sportscardauctions-on the
internet,by mail and phone, and in person-one can safely
assume that most (if not all) of the participantshave previous experience with bidding mechanisms (see, e.g., Sports
Collectors' Digest, a weekly publicationfilled with advertisements for sportscardand sports memorabiliaauctions).

centive compatible, I am comfortable with the
pragmatic choice of the allocation institution.
Finally, I use a private good, whereas CT use
public goods. Although analysis of a public
good betterreplicates a CVM study, I make the
choice of auctioningoff a privategood because
it has a naturalmarketbenchmarkthatacts as an
externalvalidity test (see, e.g., Don L. Coursey
et al., 1987; Helen Neill et al., 1994; Cummings
et al., 1995, who also use private goods). In
addition, use of a private good allows a strict
test of the CVM and the cheap talk design. This
benefit is pointed out by Mitchell and Carson
(1989 p. 193): "if people cannot accurately
value goods of this kind [private]in hypothetical markets,it is unlikely they would be able to
improve theirperformancewhen asked to value
public goods."
A. The Field Design
I conducted approximatelyequal numbersof
three treatments: hypothetical, hypothetical
with cheap talk, and actual Vickrey secondprice auctions, with different bidders in each
auction. I also experimentedwith bidder type,
conductingsome experimentswith professional
card dealers and others with nondealers. This
design was employed to capturethe distinction
between the potential hypotheticalbiases associated with bidders having market experience
and those with relatively less market experience. Sportscardshave many favorable characteristics for a calibration exercise including
familiarity,the ability to deliver, and an abstract
quality beyond the normal market good (List
and Shogren, 1998a). I conducted the treatments in December 1998 at a sportscardshow in
Tampa, FL, where there was a large supply of
card collectors.
For all treatments,I auctionedoff a Cal Ripken, Jr. 1982 Topps Traded baseball card,
which had a book value in the range of $200$250 (depending on which magazine publication was consulted). All auctions displayed the
same sportscardto all bidders-a Cal Ripken,
Jr. PSA-graded "PSA 8 near-mint/mint"baseball card. To performthe simplest possible test
of hypotheticalbias, I chose an allocationmechanism-William Vickrey's (1961) second-price
auction-which has proved straightforwardin
otherfieldexperiments.Whilenot impeccable,the
second-priceauction has performedreasonably

well in revealing preferences for both induced
and noninducedvalue auctions (see, for example, John Kagel's [1995] evaluation).6
B. ExperimentalProcedure
Each participant'sexperience followed four
steps: (1) inspection of the good, (2) learning
the auction rules, (3) placing one bid, and (4)
conclusion of the transaction.In Step 1, a potential subject approachedthe administrator's
table and inquiredabout the sale of the sportscard displayed on the table. The monitor then
invited the potential subject to participatein an
auction for the sportscardthat would take about
five minutes. If the individualagreed, the monitor briefly explained that we were auctioning
off the sportscarddisplayed on the table. The
participantcould pick up and visually examine
the card. The card was sealed with the appropriate grade clearly marked on the cardholder.
The monitor worked one-on-one with the participantand no time limit was imposed on his or
her inspection of the card.
In Step 2, the administratorgave the participant an instructionsheet that consisted of two
parts: (1) an auction rules sheet which also
included an illustrativeexample, and (2) a bidding sheet.7 In the actual auction treatments,
subjects read that "the winner of the card will
pay a price equal to the amountof the secondhighest bid." For the hypothetical auctions, I
follow CT's nomenclatureand state: "suppose
you were to bid on the sportscardon the table,
if the winner of the card were to pay a price
equal to the amount of the second-highestbid,
how much would you bid?"Subjectsparticipating in the hypotheticalwith cheap talk auctions
were read the cheap talk script just prior to
placing their hypothetical bid. The general

6
The empirical evidence concerning the demand revelation propertiesof Vickrey second-priceauctions is mixed,
and remainsa point of serious debate.In a recentstudy, List
and Shogren (1999) found that in second-priceauctions for
consumptiongoods, subjects submit relatively low bids in
early rounds of multiple-roundauctions, but bids quickly
stabilize after 1 or 2 trials-after subjects received important market feedback. As mentioned in footnote 5, the
proliferation of auctions for sportscards has presumably
provided importantmarketexperience to my subjects, who
were all recruitedon the floor of a sportscardshow.

cheap talk script is from CT, with necessary
changes due to differences in the allocation
mechanism and good. Excerpts of the script
read as follows:
... in a recent study, several different
groups of people bid on a sportscardjust
like the one you are about to bid on.
Payment was hypothetical for these
groups, as it will be for you. No one had
to pay money if they won the sportscard.
The results of these studies were that on
average, across the groups, people overstated their actual willingness to pay by
150 percent. That's quite a difference,
isn't it?
We call this a "hypotheticalbias." Hypothetical bias is the difference that we
continuallysee in the way people respond
to hypothetical situations as comparedto
real situations....
How can we get people to think about
their bid in a hypothetical auction like
they think in a real auction, where if they
win they'll really have to pay money?
How do we get them to think about what
it means to really dig into theirpocket and
pay money, if in fact they really aren't
going to have to do it?
Let me tell you why I think that we
continually see this hypothetical bias,
why people behave differently in a hypothetical auction than they do when the
auctionis real. I thinkthatwhen we bid in
a hypothetical auction we bid our best
guess of what the good is really worth on
the open market.But, when the auction is
real, and we would actuallyhave to spend
our money if we win, we think a different
way: if I spend money on this, that's
money I don't have to spend on other
things ... we bid in a way that takes into

account the limited amount of money we
have.... This is just my opinion, of
course, but it's what I think may be going
on in hypotheticalauctions.
So if I was in your shoes ... I would ask

myself: if this were a real auction, and I
had to pay $X if I win: do I really want to

spend my money this way? If I really did,
I would bid $X; if I didn't, I would bid
less than $X....
In any case, I ask you to bid just
exactly as you would bid if you were
really going to face the consequences of
your bid: which is to pay money if you
win. Please keep this in mind in our
auction.

Afterthe monitoransweredall questions,the subject workedthroughan illustrativeexample.8Following completionof the example,the participant
placeda bid on the biddingsheet (Step3). In Step
4, the administrator
explainedthat if the participantwon the auction,she would be contactedby
telephonewithinthreedays afterthe show. Upon
receiptof paymentfor the card,the cardwouldbe
sent to her via courier,postagefree.
In the nondealer experiments, the treatment
type was changed at the top of each hour, so
subjects' treatmenttype was determinedbased
on the time they visited the auction table at the
card show. The dealer treatmentstook place in
the same fashion as the nondealer treatments,
with one exception. Instead of waiting for participantsto arrive at the auction booth, the administratorvisited each dealer at his/her booth
before the sportscardshow opened, alternating
the auctionformatand cardtype. The nondealer
treatmentstook approximately14 hoursto complete (12 P.M. to 7 P.M. on Saturdayand Sunday), while the dealertreatmentstook aboutfive
hours (7 A.M. to 12 noon on Saturday).9
II. Results
Table 1 summarizesthe experimentaldata.10
The first row in Table 1 shows the means for
each treatmenttype and reveals that dealers'
bids are significantly higher than nondealers'
bids for each auctiontype. In addition,the number of zero bids in each treatment shows a
marked increase when moving from dealer to
8
To test whether subjectsunderstoodthe auction mechanisms, I ran a pilot study in November 1998 at a similar
sportscardshow in Orlando.On completion of these hypothetical auctions, subjects answered questions about their
understandingof the auction rules. Approximately 15 people took part in each auction type, and no one had any
problem understandingthe allocation and price rules.
9 The dealer sessions were completed in a more timely
manner because the dealers (in their booths) were more
accessible.
10 As an external validity check, consider the relationship between winning bids (given in rows 3 and 4 of Table
1) andbook value. The auctionmarketprices are reasonably
close to the listed PSA book value. The top two bids from
each auction type are: (actual auction, dealers: $275, $180;
nondealers:$230, $230), (hypotheticalwith cheap talk auction: dealers: $500, $350; nondealers: $330, $140); and
(hypothetical:dealers:$600, $400; nondealers:$350, $330).
The percentage of book value capturedin the actual and
hypothetical auctions are in the range of values in other
related studies (see, e.g., List and Shogren, 1998a).

nondealer auctions. These findings are consistent with previous studies (e.g., List and
Lucking-Reiley,2000), and illustratethatdealer
demandcurves are located above ordinaryconsumer demand curves.
At issue is the gap between actual and hypothetical behavior, with and without cheap talk.
In the dealer treatments, mean bids in both
hypotheticalregimes are greaterthan the average real bid; whereas in the nondealer treatments, mean bids in the actual and hypothetical
with cheap talk auctions are similar, but much
lower than the mean hypotheticalbid. The ratio
of mean hypothetical to mean real is approximately 1.85-1.95 for both dealers and nondealers. These ratios are in accordwith results from
other card auctions that use ex post techniques
to calibrate actual and hypothetical behavior
(see, e.g., List and Shogren, 1998a).
The fourth and fifth rows in Table 1 contain
parametrict-tests for the equivalency of mean
bids across auction types: Ho: xi = x, where x

representsmean bid. Since there are three auction types in each group, I compute three separate t-tests for each subsample.Table 1 is read
as follows: the dealer two-tailed t-test of hypothetical versus actual is at the intersection of
row 5, column 3, and indicates t = -2.65,
which suggests the two means are significantly
different at the p < 0.01 level.
In the dealer auctions, statistics in row 5
show that hypotheticalbids are not significantly
differentfrom hypotheticalwith cheap talk bids
at conventional levels (t = -0.32). Conversely, t-tests in rows 5 and 6 indicate that
mean bids from the actual auctions are statistically differentfrom mean bids in the hypothetical (t
talk (t

=
=

-2.65) and hypothetical with cheap
auctions at the p < 0.05
-2.46)

level. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests,
contained in rows 7 and 8 of Table 1, which
test whether the sampled populations have
identical probability distributions, reveal the
same insights-the distribution of actual bids
is to the left of both hypothetical bid distributions (z = -2.45; z = - 2.27), while the
hypothetical distributions are situated similarly (z = -0.22). These results suggest that
although bids in the hypothetical with cheap
talk design are lower than bids in the hypothetical auction, the cheap talk design failed
to eliminate hypothetical bias in the dealer
valuation exercises.

t-tests in rows 5 and 6 suggest the average
hypothetical bid is statistically different from
the mean hypotheticalwith cheap talk and mean
actual bid at the p < 0.05 level (t = -2.29;
t = -2.38). In addition,the mean actualbid is
not statistically different from the hypothetical
with cheap talk mean bid at conventional significance levels (t = -0.07). Mann-Whitney
tests of whether the sampled populations have
identical probability distributions reveal the
same insights-actual and hypothetical with
cheap talk bids are significantlyless thanbids in
the hypothetical regime (z = -1.96; z =

consumers.

importantaspects of equation (1) are worthy of
brief mention. First, the dummy variable indicator for hypothetical auction is omitted from
the equation,and thereforef1 and f2 represent
deviations from behavior in the hypothetical
scenario. The results of interest are whether 01
and 12 are significantlydifferentfrom zero, and
whetherthey are equal to one another.Second,
variables included in Xii are similar to CT.
These variables include age, income, experience with the sportscardmarket, and gender,
where gender = 1 if male, and 0 if female.12
Third,since thereis a nontrivialnumberof zero
bids, I presentestimationresultsfrom models of
ordinaryleast squares (OLS) and Tobit, which
is estimatedvia maximum likelihood.
Econometric estimates of equation (1) are
presented in Table 2. Because the Tobit and
OLS models yield similar insights, I will focus
the discussion on the coefficient estimates from
the OLS models. For both bidder types, the
empiricalestimates serve to strengthenthe findings in Table 1.13 In the dealer auctions, the
coefficient of Dreal is negative and significantly
differentfrom zero at the p < 0.05 level. Yet,
the coefficient of Dcheaptalk is not significantly
differentfrom zero at conventionallevels, suggesting behaviorin the cheap talk auctionis not
different from behavior in the purely hypothetical auction for dealers. Furthermore,results
from a likelihood-ratiotest in the bottom panel
of Table 2 suggest that 01 0 12 (X2(1 d.f.) =
5.60), implying subjects behaved differently
across the actual and hypothetical with cheap
talk auctions at the p < 0.05 level. These
results indicate that even after controlling for
subject characteristics,the empirical evidence
suggests that the cheap talk design failed to
eliminate bias in the dealer treatments.
Empiricalresults in the nondealertreatments

12
A one way ANOVA test indicates that the respective
samples for the three treatmentsdo not differ by socioeconomic characteristicsin either the dealeror nondealertreatments. Experience and age are continuous valiables, while
income is a categorical variable. Income is yearly income
from all sources before taxes and has eight categories: (1)
<$10,000; (2) $10,000-$19,999; (3) $20,000-$29,999; (4)
$30,000-$39,999; (5) $40,000-$49,999; (6) $50,000$74,999; (7) $75,000-$99,999; and (8) >$100,000.
13 Coefficient estimates of the subject characteristicsare
largely insignificant, except for the coefficient of income,
which is marginally significant and suggests that the 1982
Topps TradedCal Ripken, Jr. card is a normal good.

1503

are in strong favor of the cheap talk design.
Estimates in columns 3 and 4 of Table 2 imply
that bidding in the actual and hypotheticalwith
cheap talk auctions is differentfrom bidding in
the hypothetical auction. Coefficient estimates
of -19.65 and -21.59 suggest that bids in the
actualand hypotheticalwith cheap talk auctions
were $19.65 and $21.59 less than bids in the
hypothetical auction, controlling for other factors. Both coefficients are significantlydifferent
from zero at the p < 0.05 level. Additionally,
a likelihood-ratiotest suggests that these coefficients are not statistically differentat conventional significance levels (X2(1 d.f.) = 0.15),
indicating nondealers behaved similarly in the
actual and hypothetical with cheap talk auctions. These results lend strong support to the
above findings-for consumers, the cheap talk
design was successful in eliminating hypothetical bias, even after controlling for subjectspecific characteristics.
The main empirical finding concerning the
anomalous behavior across consumer types is
consistent with conclusions from Penny Burns'
(1985) sequential English auctions. Burns
(1985) compared the price strategy choices of
inexperiencedstudentswith those of highly experienced wool buyers and found that the wool
buyers had developed valuation strategies that
tended to be immutable. The bidding strategy
anomaly observed in Burns' data is well
summed up by one of the wool buyers, who
commented "With us it is a reflex action. Possibly others could orientate themselves more
quickly" (Burns, 1985 pp. 150-51).
The autonomicdecision-makingexhibitedby
sportscarddealers and wool buyers is in accord
with previous findings on the effects of external
signals in the value creation stage. One of the
most importantaspects of determiningthe persuasive impact of a message, such as the cheap
talk script, is the processing mode of the receiver. Past work on the complex organization
of the human mind suggests that humans have
special and highly developed cognitive mechanisms for dealing with signals (ElizabethHoffman et al., 1998). For example, evidence in the
social psychology literature suggests that an
individual will reject external informationon a
subject for which they have previous knowledge and feel strongly about (see, e.g., Yaacov
Y. I. Vertzberger, 1990). Indeed, Elana Michelson (1999) makes a similar point by noting

that "Theories of experiential learning have
tended to view experience as liberating ... as it
frees us ... from the contagious influence of others ..." (Michelson p. 140).14

The burgeoningCVM literatureis beginning
to recognize the important link between the
reliability of stated values and experience with
the good. Trudy Ann Cameronand Jeffrey Englin (1997 p. 310) note "thatCVM estimatesof
willingness to pay for some environmental
goods are only reliable if respondentshave had
some degree of experience with the commodity
being valued."In a similar spirit, the empirical
evidence presented herein suggests that the
cheap talk design may not eliminate bias for

In personal correspondence, Vernon L. Smith provided a related explanation: "[think of] context specific
specialization based on learning. Attentional resources in
the brainare very scarce. We economize on them by developing learned responses that enable autonomic decisionmaking. To change you have to kick in the higher
opportunitycost of mental resourcesto overcome the transactions cost of switching."

good. If this finding is robust for other goods
and in other contexts, it represents a serious
practicalproblem for the cheap talk design, as
experiencedusers of any good are importantin
defining the good's value.
III. Concluding Remarks

Contingentvaluationis a widely used method
of obtaining value estimates for nonmarket
commodities. A persistent issue is whether responses to CVM questions provide an accurate
depiction of true values. Some recently published studies provide evidence that suggests
hypothetical bias is an important factor that
drives a wedge between intentions and actions.
Using laboratory techniques, Cummings and
Taylor (1999) presentcompelling evidence that

field to test this scheme and find positive evidence that cheap talk does mitigatehypothetical
bias for certain consumer types. But the cheap

APPENDIX

A: SUBJECT INSTRUCTIONS FOR ACTUAL
VIcKREYAUCTION

Welcome to Lister's Auctions. You have the
opportunityto bid in an auction for the baseball
card on the table. If you are a card dealer you
will be grouped with other card dealers, if you
are a nondealeryou will be groupedwith other
nondealers.
The card up for auction is the 1982 Cal Ripken, Jr. Topps TradedPSA 8 on the table.
Auction Rules.-A sealed-bid second-price
auction will be used to determine the winner
of each item. Thus, if your bid of $X is the
highest bid and the next highest bid is $X 5, you win the card but only pay $X - 5.
Under this bidding mechanism it is best for
you to bid your true value because overbidding may cause you to pay too much and
underbiddingdecreases your odds of winning
the item.
I will accept bids until Sunday at 5 P.M. On
Monday morning I will order the bids from
highest to lowest in orderto determinethe winner of the card.
For example, if the top four bids are ranked
highest to lowest as follows:
$A
$B
$C
$D
The bidder who bid $A wins the card and
pays $B.
Given that the winner of the card will pay a
price equal to the amountof the second-highest
bid, please place your bid below:
Cal Ripken, Jr. 1982 Topps "Traded"NRMT
PSA 8 $
After the winner pays me cash or check for
the card,the card will be awardedto the winner
(we pay postage). Please sign the dotted line
below to verify your bids. Also, please provide

Before you bid, I want to talk to you about a
problemthatwe have in studieslike this one. As
I told you a minute ago, this is a hypothetical
auction-not a real one. No one will actually
pay money at the end of the auction.But, I also
asked you to bid as thoughthe resultof your bid
could involve a real cash payment by you.
And that's the problem.
In most studies of this kind, folks seem to
have a hardtime doing this. They bid differently
in a hypotheticalauction, where they don't really have to pay money, than they do in a real
auction, where they really could have to pay
money. For example, in a recent study, several
differentgroups of people bid in an auctionjust
like the one you are about to bid in. Payment
was hypotheticalfor these groups, as it will be

for you. No one had to pay money if they won
the auction. The results of these studies were
that on average, across the groups, people
overstated their actual willingness to pay by
150 percent. That's quite a difference, isn't
it?
We call this a "hypotheticalbias." "Hypothetical bias" is the difference that we continually see in the way people respond to
hypotheticalauctions as comparedto real auctions-just like the overbidding example presented above.
In the real auction, where people knew they
would have to pay money if they actually won,
people lowered their bid drastically.
How can we get people to think about their
bid in a hypotheticalauctionlike they think in a
real auction,where if a person wins he/she will
really have to pay money? How do we get them
to think about what it means to really dig into
their pocket and pay money, if in fact they
really aren't going to have to do it?
Let me tell you why I think that we continually see this hypothetical bias, why people behave differently in a hypothetical auction than
they do when the auction is real. I think that
when we bid in a hypothetical auction we bid
our best guess of what the good is really worth
on the open market. But, when the auction is
real, and we would actually have to spend our
money if we win, we think a differentway: if I
spend money on this, that's money I don't have
to spend on other things ... we bid in a way that

takes into accountthe limited amountof money
we have ... This is just my opinion, of course,

but it's what I think may be going on in hypothetical auctions.
So, if I were in your shoes, and I was asked
to bid on the sportscardon the table, I would
think about how I feel about spending mny
money this way. When I got ready to bid, I
would ask myself: if this were a real auction,
and I had to pay $X if I win, do I really want to

spend my money this way? If I really did, I
would bid $X; if I didn't, I would bid less than
$X, but a value that equaled my true value.
That'sjust my opinion, of course. You must do
whateveryou want to do.
In any case, I ask you to bid just exactly as
you would bid if you were really going to face
the consequences of your bid: which is to pay
money if you win the auction.
Please keep this in mind in our auction.
