SPECIFICATION TESTS IN ECONOMETRICS
BY J. A. HAUSMAN'

Using the result that under the null hypothesis of no misspecification an asymptoticall

efficient estimator must have zero asymptotic covariance with its difference from a
consistent but asymptotically inefficient estimator, specification tests are devised for a

number of model specifications in econometrics. Local power is calculated for small

departures from the null hypothesis. An instrumental variable test as well as tests for a
time series cross section model and the simultaneous equation model are presented. A
empirical model provides evidence that unobserved individual factors are present whi

are not orthogonal to the included right-hand-side variable in a common econometr

specification of an individual wage equation.

1. INTRODUCTION

SPECIFICATION TESTS FORM ONE of the most important areas for res
econometrics. In the standard regression framework, y = X13 + c, the
chastic specifications are first that the conditional expectation of ? giv
zero (or for fixed X, e have expectation zero) and that e have a spherical
covariance matrix

(1.la) E(rIX)= 0 or in large samples plim -X's = 0,
T

(1 . l b) V(E IX) = C_2j,
Failure of the first assumption, sometimes called the orthogonality assumption,
leads to biased estimates while failure of the second assumption, sometimes
called the sphericality assumption, leads to loss of efficiency although the central
tendency of the estimator is still correct. While in many problems the payoff to

detecting failure of assumption (1.la) is presumably greater than detecting
failure of assumption (1.1b), most of the attention in the econometric literature
has been paid to devising tests for the latter assumption. Ramsey [16] and Wu
[25] are among the few references to specification tests. Yet, the problem is so
important that increased attention should be paid, especially since efficient
estimators under assumption (1.1) are now available in almost all situations; and
these estimators are often quite sensitive to failures of the first assumption.
In this paper a general form of specification test is proposed which attempts to

provide powerful tests of assumption (1.la) and presents a unified approach to
specification error tests. Thus, an ad hoc test would not need to be devised for
each specific situation, but the general scheme presented here could be applied

to specific situations. A main stumbling block to specification tests has been a
lack of precisely specified alternative hypotheses. Here, I point out that in many
situations, including time series-cross section specifications, errors in variables

specifications, and simultaneous equation specifications, the alternative hypoth-

esis that assumption (1.1 a) fails may be tested in an expanded regression
framework. The basic idea follows from the existence of an alternative estimator
which is consistent under both null and alternative hypotheses. By comparing

the estimates from this estimator with the efficient estimator (under assumption
1.la) and noting that their difference is uncorrelated with the efficient estimator

when the null hypothesis is true, easily used tests may be devised from the
regression

(1.2) y =X,8 +Xa +v

where X is a suitably transformed version of X. The specification tests are

performed by constructing a test of the hypothesis Ho: a = 0. Also local power
considerations are discussed, and the distribution of the power function under
the alternative hypothesis is derived.
In Section 2 the basic lemma regarding these types of specification tests is

proven. The test is applied to an errors in variables problem and equation (1.2) is

derived. The following two sections discuss two new specification tests for the
time series-cross section model and for the simultaneous equation model. Both

tests are always available (unlike the errors in variables test which requires an

instrumental variable) and should be used for these two important model
specifications. Lastly, an example is provided. The example is interesting since a
widely used time series-cross section specification, the random effects model, is
found not to be consistent with the alternative specification. The general prin-

ciple of this paper can be applied in additional problems not considered here.
Therefore the tests should be useful to the applied econometrician.

2. THEORY AND A TEST OF ERRORS IN VARIABLES

The theory underlying the proposed specification tests rests on one

fundamental idea. Under the (null) hypothesis of no misspecification, there will
exist a consistent, asymptotically normal and asymptotically efficient estimator,
2

where efficiency means attaining the asymptotic Cramer-Rao bound. Under the
alternative hypothesis of misspecification, however, this estimator will be biased
and inconsistent. To construct a test of misspecification, it is necessary to find
another estimator which is not adversely affected by the misspecification; but
this estimator will not be asymptotically efficient under the null hypothesis. A

consideration of the difference between the two estimates, q = 813 _o where /
2This paper will concentrate on the large sample case since in each test one or both of
estimators has a normal distribution only asymptotically. Most econometric estimators, except for
least squares, have this property. A discussion of the notion of asymptotic efficiency may be found in
Rothenberg [18, Ch. 2]. Henceforth, efficient will stand for asymptotically efficient and likewise for
bias, while variance means variance of the asymptotic distribution. Analogous finite sample results
hold true under appropriate conditions.

is the efficient estimate under Ho and 41 is a consistent estimator under H1, will
then lead to a specification test. If no misspecification is present, the probability

limit of q is zero. With misspecification plim q will differ from zero; and if the
power of the test is high, q will be large in absolute value relative to its
asymptotic standard error. Hopefully, this procedure will lead to powerful tests
in important cases because the misspecification is apt to be serious only when the
two estimates differ substantially.

In constructing tests based on q, an immediate problem comes to mind. To
develop tests not only is the probability limit of q required, but the variance of

the asymptotic distribution of VT4, V(q), must also be determined. Since 18
,81 use the same data, they will be correlated which could lead to a messy

calculation for the variance of VT4. Luckily, this problem is resolved easily
in fact, V(q)= V(481)- V(430)= V1- VO under the null hypothesis of no
misspecification. Thus, the construction of specification error tests is simplified,
since the estimators may be considered separately because the variance of the

difference T3q = -1 _o) is the difference of the respective variances. The
intuitive reasoning behind this result is simple although it appears to have
remained generally unnoticed in constructing tests in econometrics. The idea

rests on the fact that the efficient estimator, 180, must have zero asymptotic
covariance with q under the null hypothesis for any other consistent, asymptotically normal estimator 381. If this were not the case, a linear combination of
,80 and q could be taken which would lead to a consistent estimator ,* which

would have smaller asymptotic variance than 4o which is assumed asymptoticall
efficient. To prove the result formally, consider the following lemma:

LEMMA 2.1: Consider two estimators tog, /1 which are both consistent

asymptotically normally distributed with /30 attaining the asymptotic Cramer-Ra

bound so (A- /3 ) AN(O, Vo) and aT( 1 _f3) A N(O, V1) where Vo is the inve
of Fisher's information matrix. Consider q =,81-f/o. Then the limiting distr
tions of H(B40 - B) and 4T4 have zero covariance, C(/30, q) =0, a zero matrix

PROOF: Suppose flo and q are not orthogonal. Since plim 4= 0 define a n
estimator 82 =,/o + rAq where r is a scalar and A is an arbitrary matrix to be
chosen. The new estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal with asymptotic variance

(2.2) V(42) = V(4o)+ rAC(4o, q)+ rC'(4o, 4)A'+ r2A V(q)A'.
Now consider the difference between the asymptotic variance of the new

3Besides consistency and asymptotic normality, uniform convergence is also required to r
superefficiency. However, it is not difficult to demonstrate that standard econometric estimators

converge uniformly. A sufficient condition which leads to a straightforward proof is to assume that
the parameter space is compact. T. Amemiya and T. Rothenberg have helped in resolving this issue.

4A statement of this lemma in the finite sample case for one parameter is contained in a pa
R. A. Fisher [8], a reference supplied by W. Taylor. It is clearly related to an asymptotic version of the
Rao-Blackwell theorem (Rao [17]).

estimator and the old asymptotically efficient estimator

(2.3) F(r) = V(2)- V(o)= rAC + rC'A' + r2A V(q)A'.
Taking derivatives with respect to r yields

(2.4) F'(r)=AC+C'A'+2rA V(q)A'.
Then choose A = -C' and note that C is symmetric, which leads to

(2.5) F'(r) = -2C'C + 2rC' V(4)C.
Therefore at r = 0, F'(O) = -2C'C s- 0 in the sense of being nonpositive definite.
But F(0) =0 so for r small F(r) <0 and there is a contradiction unless C=

C(130, q) = 0 since 13o is asymptotically efficient implies F(r) - 0.
Once it has been shown that the efficient estimator is uncorrelated wi
asymptotic variance of q is easily calculated.

COROLLARY 2.6: V(A)= V(11)- V(A%) 0 in the sense of being nonneg
definite.

PROOF: Since q 4+13o 1, V(q)+ V(10)= V(4D. Furthermore, 80 attains the
asymptotic CR bound. Given the above result a general misspecification test can

be specified by considering the statistic

(2.7) m = T4'V(q)q14
where V(q) is a consistent estimate of V(q). This statistic will be shown to be
distributed asymptotically as central xK under the null hypothesis where K is the

number of unknown parameters in f when no misspecification is present. In

what follows, it is sometimes easier to work with q rather than vi/T4 so defi
Mo = (1/T)Vo, M1 = (1/T)Vj, and M(q) = (1/T)V(4). In terms of the M's, the

statistic is m = 4'M()1qq.

The statistic m in equation (2.7) specifies the distribution of the difference of

the two estimators when no misspecification is present. The other operating

characteristic of a test is its power. Unfortunately, power considerations have
not been paid much attention in econometrics, probably due to the impreciseness of alternative hypotheses and the complexity of deriving distributions of
power functions. The power of our specification test depends on the nonnull

distribution of the statistic in equation (2.7). In most applications I will show that
the power can be approximated in large samples, for alternatives close to the null

hypothesis, by the noncentral x2 distribution with noncentrality parameter
(2.8) 8= q

where q = plim (0 1- _0) the probabilit
estimates .
5 The discussion of local power which follows is due to the extremely helpful guidance of T. J.
Rothenberg. A good reference is Cox and Hinkley [6, Ch. 91.

SPECIFICATION TESTS 1255

Power considerations are important because they give the probability of

rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. In many empirical investigation
and 81 seem to be far apart yet the null hypothesis that q = 0 is not rejected. If
the probability of rejection is small for a difference of say qA where qA is large
enough to be important, then not much information has been provided by the

test. Now deriving the large sample distributions of test statistics under the
alternative hypothesis is a difficult matter especially under a wide range of

alternative hypotheses which are being considered here. Therefore, I will only be
able to derive the asymptotic distributions of the power function of a sequence of

models under local conditions where the sequence of alternatives 4 is of order
a/1'Twhere a is a constant vector. Only alternatives close to the null hypothesis
can be investigated in this manner but they hopefully provide a guide to a
broader range of cases. The necessity of this limitation can be best shown by a
simple example. Consider a two equation triangular system

(2.9a) y1 = x1y + u1,

(2.9b) Y2U=Yl +U2.
If u1 and u2 have zero covariance, least squares on equation (2.9b) is the
(asymptotically) efficient estimator of f8 while with nonzero covariance it is
inconsistent. Then, an instrumental variable estimator (say two stage least
squares) is consistent. The test statistic m from equation (2.7) is asymptotically

equivalent to a test that Or12 = 0 where the estimated covariance is formed from
the residuals of the 2SLS estimate of equation (2.9b), a2, and the residuals of the
OLS estimate of equation (2.9a), t21. Under the alternative hypothesis assume

that the true covariance is Or12, and I want to construct a test based on the fac

that Y(&12- -12) AN(O, v12). Assume a consistent estimate v L2 is used for v
and let v12 = w while v^ 2 = w. Tests will be usually formed from the statistic

0l(512-o12)/W] where OJ12 is the hypothesized value of 0-12; here 012 =0Adding and subtracting the true o-lj leads to the expression
(2.10) jT(512o"12) A AT( A-12)

Under the null hypothesis only the first term is present since 0r12 = 0r12 = 0 SO

asymptotically normal or central x2 distributions are derived for tests of U12=
012. When U102 0 012 under the alternative hypothesis, the second term remains

finiLe only when a sequence of models is considered so that I/T(o-12- 012)
converges to a finite constant since w is a consistent estimate of w. Otherwise the
second term explodes and large sample power functions cannot be derived
unless further approximations are made. However, the explosion of this term

insures a consistent test. The analysis of the case where 0r12 converges to U012

rate VT corresponds to the idea of local power: the distribution of the tes
statistic under the alternative hypothesis is considered for cases close to the null
hypothesis.

To return from the simple example to our more general case I will consider a

sequence of models corresponding to the concept of local power. Thus as b

under Ho, I assume both estimates are consistent, that I/ 7Xo - /8) AN(O, Vo),

and that FT(f1-/3) A N(O, V1). I assume that under H1, V,lTo-plimflo) and

IFT(f31 - ,f) are asymptotically normal with covariance matrices that are

continuous functions of the true f3.
THEOREM 2.1: Under Ho, the test statistic m = T' V(q q XK where V(q) is
a consistent estimate (under Ho), of V(q) using 41 and o.6

PROOF: Let V1T4 = VT(,8j-8 3o)-N(O, V(q)) using the corollary. Then
TV'q (q^'q is distributed asymptotically as central x2 since it has the same

asymptotic distribution as T4' q q.

As an approximation for practical use, the statistic q'M( q1q can be used in
place of m.

To derive the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic under the alternative

hypothesis, consider local alternatives. That is, consider a sequence of models

such that the sequence of alternatives q is of order (1/I/T). Then I can show
as long as V(q) approaches V(q) the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic
is non-central x2

THEOREM 2.2: Under H1 consider a sequence of models represented by a
sequence parameters q/H;(q 0 O) so that gT = plim 30T - /3= /3T - /8 such that
limT--0o/ TgT = a <co. Then as T-> co along the chosen path mT - T4jl-VT(q q4T
is distributed asymptotically as noncentral X with k degrees of freedom and

noncentrality parameter 82= limTh0O Tg'T-V(q) gT which is approximately
so long as VT(?) is a consistent estimate of V(q) under H1.

PROOF: Because the asymptotic covariance matrices of /3o and 381 are
continuous functions of /3, along the sequence of local departures of the model as
T -> oo, their covariance matrices approach VO and V1, respectively. For each
local departure from the null hypothesis in the sequence, {gT}, POT is inconsistent. However, since the departures are only local, it can be shown (Cox and

Hinkley [6, pp. 317-18]) that asymptotically V7f(1AOT-IvT) AN(0, VO). T
although the mean of the asymptotic distribution of ,80 has changed from the

Now under H1 let o-12 :0 and then the inconsistency in 8 0 is plim 13o-13=
o-12/(K+ 022). To determine the limiting distribution of /80 it is convenient to
assume that u1 and u2 have a bivariate normal distribution. Then Rothenberg

where lim v'7T[o12/(K + (J22)] is the a of Theorem 2.2. However Vo =

olii/(K+ O22) so it needs to be shown that for local departures from th
hypothesis the last two terms in the asymptotic variance disappear as T -> 00. But
since by assumption V17To12 converges to a (finite) constant the terms involving

O 12 converge to zero so long as (K + Or22) is nonzero. Thus, for local departures

in large samples VO gives a correct approximation and a noncentral x2 dis7,8

tribution may be used.'

For a given size of test the power increases with 82 which in turn depends on

how far the plim of the biased and inconsistent estimator /3o is from the plim of

the consistent estimator 81 when misspecification is present. Thus, the
comparison estimator 81 should be chosen so that if a certain type of
misspecification is feared to be present, q, which is the difference of the estimates, is expected to be large. The other consideration in equation (2.8) is to
keep V(q) small so that a large departure between ,Bo and /8 will not arise by
chance. This requirement means that ,81 should be relatively efficient but at the
same time sensitive to departures from the model specification. To highlight the
power considerations the specification test of equation (2.7) will be reformulated
in a statistically equivalent form. Also, the reformulated test may be easier to use
with available econometrics computer programs. To demonstrate this reformulated test, an errors in variables example is considered.
An errors in variables test attempts to determine if stochastic regressors and
the disturbances in a regression are independent. In the simplest case consider
the model

7Wu's [25] derivation of the (nonlocal) limiting distribution of the test statistic under the
alternative hypothesis in equation (3.12) of his paper seems incorrect since application of the central
limit theorem on p. 748 requires the sum of random variables with zero mean. Thus his variable e1
does not have a limiting distribution. Interpreted locally Wu's results seem valid since only the usual
least squares variance term VO is needed.
8A referee points out that in general there may exist many estimates of V(q) which are consistent

under Ho so that Theorem 2.1 holds. However, the estimate which provides the greatest power
under H1 is preferable to use. If one considers a class of estimators such that plim V(q)= cV(q )
where c is a constant, Wu's [25] results (interpreted locally) lead to the conclusion that one should
use the estimator associated with the smallest c. Therefore for the instrumental variable test, s0, the
2
least squares estimate of oa, seems appropriate to use for this example. For Theorem 2.2 to hold in
general, consistent estimates of the nuisance parameters are required.

where (1/T)B is our finite sample approximation to D, B = cr2[GC%Cf1 - (x'x) f.

Under H1, the probability limit of q, q =B / o-,2/m2 so the asymptotic distribution of m for local departures depends on the magnitude of the two

The IV estimates, 81v and si, are consistent under both the null and alternative

A consistent estimate of m2 follows from the data, and an estimate of cr2 is

derived from the equation 6r22 = (1 -OLS//3JV)mX. Then an estimate of q may
be calculated for any choice of f3 and the non-centrality parameter 82 is a

quadratic function around 6 = 0, 82 = (32o42/m4 (q)). Note that the asymptotic
variance of the IV estimator enters the denominator as expected, so that IV
estimates with large variance decrease the power of the test. The tables of the

noncentral x2 test in Scheffe [21] can be consulted to find the probability of the
null hypothesis being rejected for a given value of / if the alternative hypothesis
is true conditional on the estimates of the incidental parameters of the problem.

proposed by Liviatan [12]. Wu [25] considers tests with different estimates of the
nuisance parameter o2 to derive a finite sample F test under a stronger hypothesis about the stochastic properties of x.9
The IV test for errors in variables is known in the literature, but an alternative

formulation of the test leads to easier implementation.'0 Partition the vecto
into two orthogonal components, x = x^ + v, which is the sum of the instrument
and that part of x orthogonal to z. Then the least squares regression specification
of equation (2.12) can be rewritten as

(2.18) y =/,x + E1 = 3x3 +'8v +E1.
Now consider running this regression to compare the two estimates of /3.

The variable x^ is asymptotically orthogonal to E1 under both the null and
alternative hypothesis and is orthogonal to v by construction. Therefore the least

squares regression coefficient of x is consistent under both hypotheses, being the

IV estimate 831. The estimate of /3 corresponding to the variable v, however,
should only have the same plim as 13' under the null hypothesis when v is

orthogonal to El. Thus, we might test whether the two estimates are equal. Sinc
under the alternative hypothesis the plim of the second coefficient is no longer /,

I will refer to it as y and then rewrite equation (2.15) after adding and subtract-

ing ,/v to make the test of equality easier:

(2.19) y =/ x+yv+r,=,3(x+v)+(y-/3)v +El =/x +av +El.

Thus for a = y - /3, the proposed test is a large sample test on the hypothes
a = 0. One last minor simplification can be made by noting that an equivalent
regression to equation (2.19) is

(2.20) y =/,x +ax+E,
since a = (v 'Qv)1v'QXY = -(x' QYx' QXY where Qx = I - x (x'x) x'. A test
of a = 0 from equation (2.20) under the null hypothesis is then based on the

statistic o2x = x' ( x'Q a)i. But (l/o 2)(x^'Q xx = (x x)-%'B x 'xG and
(x'Qxx^)- ('x )q. Thus, this formulation is equivalent to the IV test of equation

(2.17) since

A) A= 12qx
A
(2.21) 12(A,(.i,QX
a Q,xC)
=4q'B q.

9The instrumental variable test can also be considered a formalization and an improvemen
suggestion by Sargan [20] who recommended checking whether the least squares estimates lie
outside the confidence regions of the IV estimates. For individual coefficients the procedure used
here is to see whether the least squares estimate lies outside the confidence regions centered at the

IV estimate and with length formed from the square root of the difference of the IV variance minu
the OLS variance. Thus shorter confidence intervals follow from the current procedure than from
Sargan's suggestion. The joint x test on all the coefficients in equation (2.14) if there are more than
one, however, is the preferred test of the null hypothesis rather than separate consideration of each
confidence interval.
10 Presentation of this alternative method of testing has been improved from an earlier version of
the paper using a suggestion of Z. Griliches.

evident using the previous formulation of the test. First, cx may be large relative

to its standard error. This result points to rejection of the hypothesis of no

misspecification. The other clear cut case is a small a' with a small standard error
which presents little evidence against Ho. The last result is a large standard error
relative to the size of a'. This finding indicates a lack of power which will be very
evident to the user since he will not have a precise estimate of a.
Two immediate generalizations of the errors in variables specification test can
be made. The test can be used to test any potential failure of assumption (1.la)
that additional right-hand-side variables are orthogonal to the error term so long
as instrumental variables are available. First, additional right-hand-side variables can be present:

(2.22) y = X1 1 + X232 + E,
where the X1 variables are possibly correlated with E while the X2 variables are
known to be uncorrelated. Given a matrix of variables Z (which should include

X2), qc will again be the difference between the IV estimator and the efficient O

estimator. Letting X1 = PzX1 where P, = Z(Z'Z)-1Z' leads to the regression

(2.23) =X11+X2P2 + Xya + v
where a test of Ho: a = 0 is a test for errors in variables.'2 The last orthogonality
test involves a lagged endogenous variable which may be correlated with the

disturbance. In this case, however, if the specification of the error process is
known such as first order serial correlation, a more powerful test may be

available. 13
In this section the general nature of the misspecification problem has been

discussed when there exists an alternative estimator which provides consistent
estimates under misspecification. By demonstrating that the efficient estimator
has zero asymptotic covariance with the difference between the consistent esti-

mator 1 and the asymptotically efficient estimator (under Ho) o, a simple

expression for the variance of (,3o-/31) test is found. Then by applying it to t

Using s0 to estimate o2 corresponds to the Lagrange multiplier form of the test while using s
the IV estimate, corresponds to using the Wald form of the test. The tests differ under the alternative

hypothesis depending on the estimate of the nuisance parameter o2 which is used. Silvey [23]
discusses the large sample relationship of the tests.

12 For V(q^) to be nonsingular here, it is necessary that enough instruments be available to insu
that X1 - X1 has rank q.

13 For the true regression problem (no lagged endogenous variables) under both the null hypothesis of no serial correlation and the alternative hypothesis i30, the OLS estimator, is unbiased and
consistent since only assumption (1.lb) is violated. Therefore, if the null hypothesis of serial

correlation is tested with an autoregressive estimator 'j, plim q^ = q = 0 under both hypothe

is large relative to its standard error, misspecification is likely to be present.

errors in variables problem, an easy method to apply the test is demonstrated
which also makes power considerations clearer. The usefulness of this test is

unfortunately decreased by the lack of a valid instrument in some situations. The
next misspecification test, however, always can be done since the necessary data
is available. It is a test of the random effects model which has been widely used in
econometrics.
3. TIME SERIES-CROSS SECTION MODELS

Time series-cross section models have become increasingly important in
econometrics. Many surveys, rather than being limited to a single cross section,
now follow a panel of individuals over time. These surveys lead to a rich body of
data given the wide variability between individuals coupled with much less
variability for a given individual over time. Another important use of these

models is to estimate demand across states over a period of time. Since for many
goods (e.g., energy) considerable price variation exists across states while
aggregate price indices move smoothly over time, time series-cross section
models allow disentanglement of income and substitution effects which is often
difficult to do with aggregate data.

The simplest time series-cross section model is specified as

(3.1) Yit = Xit. + tki + Ecit (i = 1, N; t = 1, T),

where 1ui is the individual effect. The two alternative s
differ in their treatment of the individual effect. The so
treats 1ui as a fixed but unknown constant differing ac
least squares on equation (3.1) is the correct estimator. To estimate the slope
coefficients, deviation from means are used leading to the transformed observations Yit = Yit - 5i, Xit = xit - Xi, iit = Ei, - ?i, and the regression specification,'4
(3 . 2) )it = Xit + ?it.

An equivalent way of writing equation (3.2) is to let e be a T column vector of

ones so that e=(1,1,...,1)' and to let Pe=e(e'e)Y1e'=(1/T)ee'=(1/T)JT
with Qe = I (I - Pe). Then the fixed effects specification on the stacked model
is

(3.3) QeY = QeX/3 + Qea + Qe = X/3 +
which is identical to equation (3.2) since Qea = 0.

The alternative specification for the time series-cross section model is known

as the random effects or variance components model. Instead of treating ,ui as a
fixed constant, this specification assumes that 1ui is drawn from an idd distribution, 1ui - N(O, oI2L), and is uncorrelated both with the Ei and with the Xit.
The specification then becomes
(3.4) Yit = Xit. + ??it, ??it = Ai + Lit,
14 Analysis of variance notation is being used, e.g., Y- = (1/T) t= /2yit.

squares where

Usually the variances, o- I and o_ , are not known, so consistent estimat

derived from initial least squares estimates to form ji (see Wallace and Hussain

[24]. This estimator is asymptotically efficient; and, if iterated to convergence, it
yields the maximum likelihood estimates.

The choice of specification seems to rest on two considerations, one logical

and the other statistical. The logical consideration is whether the p.i can be
considered random and drawn from an iid distribution. Both Scheffe [21] and
Searle [22] contain excellent discussions of this question within an analysis of
variance framework. Another way to consider the problem, suggested by Gary

Chamberlain, is to decide whether the ,ui's satisfy di Finnetti's exchangeability
criterion which is both necessary and sufficient for random sampling. Briefly, the
criterion is to consider the sample j, = (,t 1, . .. , ,tN) and to see whether we can

exchange p.i and 1uj (e.g., the constant for Rhode Island and California) while
maintaining the same subjective distribution. If this logical criterion is satisfied,
as it might well be for models of individuals like an earnings function, then the
random effects specification seems appropriate. A statistical consideration is

then to compare the bias atid efficiency of the two estimators in estimating,l/
slope coefficients.16 Wallace and Hussain [24], Maddala [13], and Nerlove [15]
have recently discussed this issue, all pointing out that the estimators become
identical as T becomes large in the appropriate way as can be seen by the

definition of y in equation (3.6). Since the case in econometrics is usually that N
is large relative to T, differences between the two estimators are an important
problem.
15 This method of estimating the random effects models seems to have gone unnoticed in the
literature. It requires less computation than the usual GLS method or the matrix weighted average of
two estimates.

16 In other words, even if one decides that the random effects specification is appropriate on
logical grounds, he may decide to use the fixed effects estimator which conditions on the particular

sample of ii, thus treating them as fixed in the sample.

Under the random effects specification /3GLS is the asymptotically efficient
estimator while the fixed effects estimator f3FE is unbiased and consistent but not

efficient.17 However, an important issue of specification arises which was pointed
out by Maddala [13, p. 357] and has been further emphasized by Mundlak [14].

The specification issue is whether the conditional mean of the 1ui can be regarde

as independent of the Xj,'s, i.e., whether E(AtI Xj,)= 0.18 If this assumptio
violated, the random effects estimator is biased and inconsistent while the fixed
effects estimator is not affected by this failure of orthogonality. Consider an

individual earnings equation over time. If an unobserved variable, "spunk",
affects education and has an additional effect on earnings, then the assumption

of independent iii's will be violated. Thus, a natural test of the null hypothesis o
independent wki's is to consider the difference between the two estimators,

q= 3FE -_3GLS. If no misspecification is present, then q should be near zero.
Using the lemma, V(q)= V(,lFE)- V(4GLS) so a specification test follows from

m =q'Mq(q 'q where Mq(q)= (X'QeXY'_(X'fY1X) If the random effe

specification is correct the two estimates should be near each other, rather than

differing widely as has been reported sometimes in the literature as a virtue of

the random effects specification. Therefore, while Maddala [13, p. 343] demonstrates that I3GLS is a matrix weighted average of /3FE (the within group esti-

mator) and the between group estimator, if the specification is correct then plim

q= Oso 3GLS and I3FE should be almost the same within sampling error. When
the econometrician finds his estimates /3FE to be unsatisfactory, this evidence is a
finding against his specification, not his choice of estimator. However, he should
not necessarily accept the fixed effects estimates as correct but should reconsider
the specification because errors in variables problems may be present which

invalidate the fixed effects estimates.19
The equivalent test in the regression format is to test a = 0 from doing least
squares on

(3.7) X+ Xa+v

where y and X are the y transformed random effects variables while X are the

deviations from means variables from the fixed effects specification. The tests

can be shown to be equivalent using the methods of the previous section and the

fact that QeY = Qey. This test is easy to perform since X and X differ only in the
choice of y from ecquation (4.6) while X has Y = 1.
17 A potentially important problem for the fixed effects estimator is its sensitivity to errors in
variables. Since much variation is removed in forming deviations from individual means, the amount
of inconsistency would be greater for the fixed effects estimates if errors in variables are present.
18 If the regression specification of equation (3.1) is expanded to include a lagged endogenous

variable, this variable is correlated by definition with the iii. Nerlove [15] discusses methods to
estimate this specification. The test presented here would then be used to ascertain whether the Ai

are uncorrelated with the exogenous variables.
19

Another possible test is to consider the difference of 3FE. the within group estimator, from the
between group estimator. Since the estimators are based on orthogonal projections, the variance of
the difference equals the sum of the variances. However, this test seems less powerful than the test
proposed here since our test statistic subtracts off the GLS variance from the fixed effects variance
rather than adding on the between groups variance. The difference arises because our test uses the
efficient estimator to form the comparison with the fixed effects estimator.

many applications cr,, is small relative to o_ ; and the problem sometimes arises
that when cr,, is estimated from the data it may turn out to be negative. For a

panel followed over time the Xi, are often constant so that some of the
parameters of interest will be absorbed into the individual constant when the fixed
effects estimator is used. However, it seems preferable to have alternative

estimates of the remaining slope coefficients to try to sort out possible interaction of the individual constants with the included right-hand-side variables.

The misspecification test from equation (3.7) thus seems a desirable test of the
random effects specification.

20

In this section a test of the implicit assumption behind the random effects

specification has been considered. This test should follow the logical

specification of whether the ,ki are truly random. Thus, the situation- is very
similar to simultaneous equation estimation which follows the logical question of
identification. In the next section, the specification of simultaneous equation

systems is considered, and a test is developed for correct system specification.

4. SPECIFICATION OF SIMULTANEOUS EQUATION SYSTEMS

Most estimation associated with simultaneous equation models has used single

equation, limited information estimators. Thus, two stage least sequares (2SLS)
is by far the most widely used estimator. If a simultaneous equation system is

estimated equation by equation, no check on the "internal consistency" of the
entire specification is made. An important potential source of information on

misspecification is thus neglected. This neglect is not total; one class of tests
compares estimates of the unrestricted reduced form model with the derived
reduced form estimates from the structural model as a test of the overidentifying

restrictions.21 Unfortunately, this type of test has not been widely used. Perhaps
the reason has been the inconvenience of calculating the likelihood value or the

nonlinear expansions which are required to perform the statistical comparison.
In this section a test of system specification is proposed within a more simple
framework. The test rests on a comparison of 2SLS to 3SLS estimates. Thus, the

econometrician is comparing two different estimates of the structural parameters
rather than the reduced form parameters. Usually, he has more knowledge

about what comprises a "significant difference" with respect to the structural
parameters. Under the null hypothesis of correct specification, 3SLS is efficient

20 As previously mentioned, as T becomes large, y in equation (3.6) approaches one and the tw
estimators approach each other. Thus both the numerator and denominator of the test statistic

approach zero. The test appears to remain valid so long as y does not exactly equal one and N increa
faster than T; however, numerical problems of inverting a near singular matrix may arise.
21 Within the single equation context this test has been proposed by Anderson and Rubin [1],
Basmann [2], and Koopmans and Hood [11]. Within the full information context the likelihood ratio
(LR) test has been used. Recently, Byron [4, 5] has simplified this test by advocating use of the
Lagrange multiplier test or the Wald test both of which are asymptotically equivalent to the LR test
under the null hypothesis. For further details see Silvey [23, Ch. 7].

but yields inconsistent estimates of all equations if any equation is misspecified.
2SLS is not as efficient as 3SLS, but only the incorrectly specified equation is
inconsistently estimated if misspecification is present in the system. Thus, instead
of comparing reduced form parameter estimates about which the econometrician often has little knowledge, the test compares estimates of the structural

form parameters which he should have a better feeling for since they are derived
from economic theory and are reported in estimates of other structural models.

Consider the standard linear simultaneous equation model

(4.1) YB+Zr=U
where Y is the T x M matrix of jointly dependent variables, Z is the T x K
matrix of predetermined variables, and U is a T x M matrix of structural
disturbances of the system. Full column rank of Z, nonsingularity of B, nonsin-

gular probability limits of second order moment matrices, and the rank condition
for identification are all assumed to hold. The structural disturbances are multi-

variate normal U - N(O, (SIT). After a choice of normalization and imposition
of zero restrictions each equation is written

(4.2) yi = X181 + U; where Xi=[ Y,Z] and A6 = ,
where f3i has ri elements and yi has o-i elements which correspond to the
variables in Xi whose coefficients are not known a priori to be zero. It is
convenient to stack the M equations into a system

(4.3) y==X8+U where

Y=

xU[-O

~=

Lym] Io XM] ILaM] L UM]
The two stage least squares estimator when used on each equation of the

system can conveniently be written in stacked form as 82= (X'PzX[ X'Pzy

where Pz = iM z(Z'Z)' Z'. To simplify notation rewrite the estimator as

62 = (X'X) 1X'y. Three stage least squares uses full information and links
together all equations of the system through the estimate of the covariance

matrix 4. Letting P,.Z = f OZ(Z'Z['Z', the 3SLS estimator is 83=

(X'P_zX)- X'P_zy which is simplified to 83= (X'XY X'y.22 Now 3SLS
transmits misspecificiation throughout the entire system, affecting the estimates

of all coefficients since 33-8 = (X'X)[X'U. Thus, if the jth equation is
misspecified plim (1/T)kU, X 0, and so assuming probability limits exist with l
22 If T s K so 2SLS and 3SLS cannot be used, asymptotically equivalent instrumental variable
estimators are discussed in Brundy and Jorgenson [3], Dhrymes [7], and Hausman [10]. Thus, the
current misspecification test can be applied when the full information likelihood ratio test is not
possible because unrestricted estimates of the reduced form cannot be made due to sample size
limitations.

in the jth equation depends both on the lack of orthogonality between X1 and

regression on the stacked system

(4.5) y=X8+Xa +V
and to test whether a = 0. Since X and X are computed by programs which have

2SLS and 3SLS estimators, the regression of equation (5.5) should not be
difficult to perform.

The noncentrality parameter of the local noncentral x2 distribution will be

proportional to plim (1/T)kXUj for any equation which is misspecified and also

the magnitude of the covariance elements crj. If the inverse covariance eleme
are large, then X and X will not be highly correlated so that the test will be

powerful for a given size of inconsistency. As the j'j's go to zero, the
approaches 2SLS and the test will have little power. Since the misspecification

represented by the alternative hypothesis is not specific, the appropriate action

to take in the case of rejection of Ho is not clear. One only knows that
misspecification is present somewhere in the system. If one is confident that
one or more equations are correctly specified, then the specification of other
equations could be checked by using them, say one at a time, to form a 3SLS

type estimator. That is, if equation 1 is correct and equation 2 is to be tested,

then 2SLS on equation 1 could be compared to 3SLS on equation 1 where qij
set to zero for i ? j except for i = 1, j = 2 and vice-versa in the 3SLS estimator.
Using this method the misspecification might be isolated; but, unfortunately, the
size of the test is too complicated to calculate when done on a sequence of

equations. 23
The simultaneous equations specification test is the last to be presented

although the same principle may be applied to further cases such as aggregation.

I now turn to an empirical example of the specification test to demonstrate its
potential usefulness.

23 If one attempts to check the specification of the entire system by comparing the 2SLS and 3
estimates, the x2 test of Theorem 2.1 is appropriate under Ho. However, under H1 the non-centr
x2 distribution is no longer appropriate since the 2SLS estimates are also inconsistent.

5. EMPIRICAL EXAMPLE

Comparing two alternative estimators as a means of constructing
misspecification tests has been applied to a number of situations in the preceding
sections. In this section an empirical example is presented. The example is the
time series-cross section specification test discussion in Section 4. This type of
data set is becoming increasingly common for econometric studies such as
individuals' earnings, education, and labor supply. However, added interest in
this test comes from the fact that it also implicitly tests much cross section

analysis of similar specifications. Cross section analysis can allow for no individual constant but must assume, as does random effect analysis, that the right
hand side variables are orthogonal to the residual: If the random effect

specification is rejected serious doubt may be cast therefore on much similar
cross section analysis.
For the time-series-cross-section specification test a wage equation is estimated for male high school graduates in the Michigan income dynamics study.

24

The sample consists of 629 individuals for whom all six years of observations are
present. A wage equation has been chosen due to its importance in "human

capital" analysis. The specification used follows from equation (3.1). The right
hand side variables include a piecewise linear representation of age, the presence
of unemployment or poor health in the previous year, and dummy variables for
self-employment, living in the South, or in a rural area. The fixed effects

estimates, IFE, are calculated from equation (3.3). They include an individual
constant for each person and are consistent under both the null hypothesis of no

misspecification and the alternative hypothesis. The random effects estimates,

I3GLS, are calculated from equations (3.4)-(3.6). The estimate of y from equation
(3.6) is .72736 which follows from least squares estimates of the individual

variance 5'. =.12594 and the residual variance 6re =.06068. Under th

hypothesis the GLS estimate is asymptotically efficient, but under the alternative

hypothesis it is inconsistent. The specification test consists of seeing how large

the difference in estimates is, 4=FE - GLS, in relation to its variance M(q)=

M(4FE)-M(IGLS) which follows from Lemma (2.1). In comparing the estimat
in column 1 and column 2 of Table I it is apparent that substantial differences are
present in the two sets of estimates relative to their standard errors which are

geographical location differ widely in the two models. The geographical
differences may be explained by the implicitly different way that migration is
handled in the two specifications since the fixed effects coefficient specification

coefficients only represent changes during the sample period. Unobserved
individual characteristics might well be correlated with geographical location.
Also, the effect of unemployment in the previous year is seen to be much less

24 The specification used is based on research by Gordon [9] who also kindly helped me constr
this example.

f3FE and 1GLS and their standard errors, making sure to adjust to use the fixed effects estimate of

important in affecting the wage in the fixed effects specification. Thus,
unemployment has a more limited and transitory effect once permanent indivi-

dual differences are accounted for. The test of misspecification which follows
from Lemma 2.1 is

(5.1) m = Mq q = 129.9.
Since m is distributed asymptotically as Xlo which has a critical value of 23.2 at
the 1 per cent level, very strong evidence of misspecification in the random

effects model is present. The right hand side variables Xi, are not orthogo
the individual constant ,i so that the null hypothesis is decisively rejected.
Considerable doubt about previous cross section work on wage equations may
arise from this example.

The reason for this doubt about previous cross section estimation is that

ordinary least squares on a cross section of one year will have the same expec-

tation as JGLS, the random effects estimate, on the time series-cross section
data. For example, cross section estimates of the wage equation have no individual constants and make assumption (1.la) that the residual is uncorrelated with
the right-hand-side variables. However, this example demonstrates that in the

Michigan survey important individual effects are present which are not uncorrelated with the right-hand variables. Since the random effects estimates seem

significantly biased with high probability, it may well be important to take
account of permanent unobserved differences across individuals. This problem
can only be resolved within a time series-cross section framework using a

specification which allows testing of an important maintained hypothesis of

much cross section estimation in econometrics. Thus, the importance of this type
of data is emphasized which permits us to test previously maintained hypotheses.
An equivalent formulation of the specification test is provided by the regres-

sion framework of equation (3.7). Instead of having to manipulate 10 x 10
matrices, y is regressed on both X and X. The test of the null hypothesis is then

whether a' = 0. As is apparent from column 4 of Table I many of the elements of
a are well over twice their standard error so that misspecification is clearly

present. The misspecification test follows easily from comparing s 2, the estimated variance from the random effects specification, to S2 from the augmented
specification

Again m well exceeds the approximate critical x value of 23.2. Since this form

of the test is so easy to implement when using a random effects specification as

only one additional weighted least squares regression is required, hopefully
applied econometricians will find it a useful device for testing specification.
The empirical example presented in this section illustrates use of the

misspecification test. The example rejects an application of the random effects
specification. I feel that this finding may well be quite general, and that the
uncorrelated random effects model is not well suited to many econometric

applications. The two requirements of exchangeability and orthogonality are not
likely to be met in many applied problems. Certainly, the random effects estimates should be compared with the fixed effects estimates to see if significant
differences occur. If they do, the specification of the equation should be recon-

sidered to either explain the difference or to try a different specification which
corrects the problem.

6. EXTENSIONS AND CONCLUSION

Another possible application of the methodology presented here arises when
one wants to test whether only a limited part of a model specification differs. For
instance, consider two different model specifications, where the difference arises
because the second specification has additional parameters which are restricted
in the first specification, e.g., sample selection specifications. One could do

maximum likelihood on each specification and then perform a likelihood ratio
test thus comparing the different specifications. However, if interest of the model
centers on a particular parameter which is unrestricted in both specifications, the
traditional methodology yields no way to test for a significant difference only in
that parameter. Lemma 2.1 applies so this paper provides a simple method of
testing the hypothesis of a significant difference in that particular parameter

since the unrestricted model is inefficient under the null hypothesis while it is
consistent under both the null and alternative hypotheses.

By using the result that under the null hypothesis of no misspecification, an
asymptotically efficient estimator must have zero covariance with its difference
from a consistent, but asymptotically inefficient estimator, specification tests are

devised from a number of important model specifications in econometrics. New
tests for the cross section-time series model and for the simultaneous equation

model are presented. Lastly, an empirical example is provided. The example
provides strong evidence that unobserved individual factors are present which
are not orthogonal to included right-hand-side variables in a common
econometric specification.
