1. INTRODUCTION
used by
LIFE tables are one of the oldest statisticaltechniquesand are extensively

medical statisticiansand by actuaries. Yet relativelylittlehas been writtenabout
theirmoreformalstatisticaltheory.Kaplan and Meier (1958) gave a comprehensive
reviewof earlierworkand manynew results. Chiang in a seriesof papers has, in
particular,exploredthe connectionwith birth-deathprocesses; see, for example,
Chiang (1968). The presentpaper is largelyconcernedwith the extensionof the
resultsof Kaplan and Meier to the comparisonof lifetables and moregenerallyto
ofregression-like
intolife-table
analysis.The arguments

are asymptoticbut are relevantto situationswherethe samplingfluctuationsare
large enough to be of practicalimportance.In otherwords,the applicationsare
more likelyto be in industrialreliabilitystudiesand in medical statisticsthan in
actuarial science. The proceduresproposed are, especiallyfor the two-sample
tables; see Mantel
problem,closelyrelatedto proceduresforcombiningcontingency
and Haenzel (1959), Mantel (1963) and, especiallyforthe applicationto lifetables,
Mantel (1966). There is also a strongconnectionwitha paper read recentlyto the
Societyby R. and J. Peto (1972).

the timeto "failure"or the timeto "loss" or censoring.That is, for the censored

4. ANALYSIS OF REGRESSION MODELS
There are severalapproachesto the anialysisof the above models. The simplest
is to assume Ao(t)constant,i.e. to assume an underlying
exponentialdistribution;
see, for example,Chernoff(1962) for some models of this typein the contextof
acceleratedlifetests. The nextsimplestis to take a two-parameter
familyof hazard
functions,such as the power law associated with the Weibull distributionor the
exponentialof a linearfunctionof t. Then standardmethodssuch as maximum
likelihoodcan be used; to be rigorousextensionof theusual conditionsformaximumlikelihoodformulaeand theorywould be involvedto cover censoring,but there
is littledoubt that some such justificationcould be given. This is in many ways
the most naturalapproach but will not be exploredfurtherin the presentpaper.

In thisapproacha computationally

advantageous,and modelsotherthan(9) may be morenatural.

To do thiswe take Ao(t)to be identically
zero,exceptat thepointswherefailureshave
occurred,and carryout a separate maximum-likelihood

that thereare two typesof failuretimefor each individual

To avoid undulylargenumbers,it mightoftenbe convenientto divideeach termin
thelogarithmby a suitableconstant,but thiswas not done in thepresentcase.
The maximum-likelihood
estimateof / wheny = 0 is $ = 1 65. Thus the ratio
of the hazards is estimatedas efi= 5 21; if the distributions
were exponential,this
wouldbe theratioofmeans. Confidencelimitsfor3,subjectto y = 0, can be obtained
eitherby computingthe second derivative>f(A) or directlyfromthe log likelihood.
Withthelattermethod,approximate95 percentconfidence
limitsfor : of (0.78,2.60)
are obtainedfromthosevaluesforwhichthelog likelihoodis within1 x 1.962 = 1 92
of its maximumvalue. An alternativetestof the null hypothesis: = 0 is obtained
bycomparingthelog likelihoodat : = 0 and : = P; thedifference
of7-43corresponds
to chi-squaredof 14-9 and hence to a standardizeddeviateof 3-86,in reasonable
agreementwithtestbased on U(0).
The inclusionof the extraparametery providesa test of the adequacy of the
assumptionof simplyrelatedhazards. In facttheadditionallog likelihoodachieved
by the extraparameter,about 0 01, is small, even suspiciouslysmall. Confidence
limitsfory are, at the 95 per centlevel,approximately-0-12 and 0-14. Thus any
markeddeparturefromthe proportionalhazard model is not likelyto be a smooth
monotonicchangewitht. Furtherdetailsof thelikelihoodfunctionwillnot be given
here. It is, however,quadraticto a close approximationand the particularparametrization

Finally,we considergraphicaltechniques,which are likelyto be particularly
usefulfor data more extensivethan the presentset. A firststep is to obtain unconditionalestimatesof the separatesurvivorfunctionsby (8). For sample 1 this

we gettheproductlimitestimate.Now considerestimationof thesurvivorfunctions

estimatesof the survivorfunctionsin the two samplesare givenby (37) and (38).

Fig. 1 shows the fourestimatedfunctions.Discrepancywiththe model of proportionalhazards would be shownby clear departuresof the conditionalfromthe
unconstrained

possible,in which,for instance,plots are made on a non-linearscale, or in which
residualsfromtheconstrainedfitare formed,or in whichtheanalysisis presentedin

theconsistency
of thedata witha model of proportionalhazards.
Only a verybriefnote will be added here about alternativeapproachesto the
analysis. If exponential distributionsare assumed the relevant statisticsare
the total periods at risk,namely359 weeks and 182 weeks,and the total numbers
of failures9 and 22 respectively.Approximate95 per cent confidencelimitsfor

The methodgivenin Section8 ofthepapertreatsAO(t)

ProfessorBenjamin'sanalysisis not all that different
fromthe one of the paper
especiallyin thelightof Fig. 1 (whichunfortunately

His approachis in somewayssimpler,

thanthatof thepaper. On
the otherhand, the regressionapproachdeals more readilywithcomplexproblems
involving
manyexplanatory

problems,
providedthattherelation
