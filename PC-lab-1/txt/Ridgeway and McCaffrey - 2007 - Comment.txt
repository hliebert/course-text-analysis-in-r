Statisticians at RAND have been making exten

recently, we have been adopting doubly robust (DR)

this article made us second-guess our decision. The ap
parently strong performance of OLS and the authors'
finding that no method outperformed OLS ran counter
to our intuition and experience with propensity score
weighting and DR estimators. We posited two potential
explanations for this. First, we suspected that the high
variance reported by the authors when using propensity
score weights could result from their use of standard
logistic regression. Second, stronger interaction effects
in the outcome regression model might favor the DR

GBM is a general, automated, data-adaptive algo

Shrunken coefficients prevent the model from overfit

keeping the estimated propensity scores relatively fiat

COMMENT 541
Using their model from Section 1.4, we generated 1000
dataseis and calculated the population and nonresponse

estimator as they did for Tables 1, 3, 5 and 6. In ad
dition, for each dataset we also estimated propensity
scores using GBM (the ps ( ) function optimizes the
number of basis functions in the model to minimize
the largest of the marginal Kolmogorov-Smirnov sta
tistics). While their simulations do not test this, Kang
and Sch?fer noted that choices other than logistic re
gression may be preferable and offered robit regression
as a possibility. We included robit(l) propensity score
estimates in our simulations as well.
In addition to experimenting with other propensity
score estimators, we also expanded the simulation to
add an interaction term equal to 2OZ1Z2 to the mean
function for Y. R code for the simulation experiments
is available upon request.

or robit regression), the use of Z or X as covariates
in the propensity score model, and the use of either
population weighting (IPW-POP) or the nonresponder
reweighting (IPW-NR). The elements of the table con
tain the ratio of the RMSE of the alternative estimators
to the RMSE of OLS fit with the covariates listed in

each column heading.
First note that IPW estimators with logistic regres
sion using the X covariates have by far the largest
RMSEs in the table. Second, while OLS seems to be
preferable over IPW methods in the case where there is
in truth no interaction, when the OLS models exclude

an important interaction the IPW methods are prefer

able. When faced with the choice between OLS and

IPW, the analyst must decide whether to hedge against
an interaction and use IPW or choose OLS, hoping that

the outcome model is specified correctly and conse

The rows define the model used for the propensity score weights and the columns define the variables used in the outcome regression. The

investigated this using the same propensity score mod

els described previously and the bias corrected (BC)
and weighted least squares (WLS) described by Kang
and Sch?fer. Table 2 compares the relative efficiency
of DR estimators in terms of the RMSE of the DR es
timators compared to OLS. The most interesting com
parisons are those for which both the propensity score

model and the outcome regression model use X. Other
combinations, such as the propensity score fit with X
and the outcome regression fit with Z, are not realistic
but are included for completeness.
The results clearly show that WLS with GBM dom
inates OLS. When the model for Y is correct, WLS is
essentially as efficient as the OL,S estimator. When the

model for Y is incorrect, WLS with GBM can be sig
nificantly more efficient than OLS. GBM also outper
forms the robit regression model that the authors sug
gested as an option. These results suggest that DR esti
mators might be reliable methods of buying insurance
against model misspecification without paying a high
price in lost efficiency.

3. SUMMARY
In the simulation the doubly robust estimators are
particularly useful when the model is missing an im
portant interaction between pretreatment variables. Ex

ploratory data analysis could be used to find such
missing terms in the model and hence the advantages

of WLS might appear overstated. However, such ex
ploratory analyses require modeling the outcome and
present the opportunity for the model selection to be
corrupted by the impact of alternative models on the
estimated treatment effect. That is, the model might be
chosen because it yields significant treatment effects.
This type of model fitting removes one of the benefits
of the propensity score approach, which is the ability
to control for pretreatment variable prior to seeing the
outcome to avoid the temptation or even the appear
ance of data snooping.
Doubly robust estimators with GBM appear to have
the desired properties in this simulation study. When
the model for the mean is correct, there is no cost for

using the doubly robust estimator (bias corrected or
WLS). They are essentially as efficient as the correctly

specified OLS model. When the OLS model is incor
rect, again the doubly robust estimators are at least as
efficient as OLS and substantially more efficient when
the OLS model is missing important interaction terms.
While it is clear that more work on these estimators is

needed, our results do suggest that doubly robust esti
mation should not be dismissed too quickly.
