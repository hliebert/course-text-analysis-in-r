Abstract
Consider two di¤erent parametric models. Suppose one model is correctly speci…ed, but
we don’t know which one (or both could be right). Both models include a common vector of
parameters, in addition to other parameters that are separate to each. An estimator for the
common parameter vector is called Doubly Robust (DR) if the estimator is consistent no matter
which model is correct. We provide a general technique for constructing DR estimators, which
we call General Doubly Robust (GDR) estimation. Our GDR estimator is a simple extension
of the Generalized Method of Moments, with analogous root-n asymptotics. We illustrate the
GDR with a variety of models, including average treatment e¤ect estimation. Our empirical
application is an instrumental variables model where either one of two candidate instruments
might be invalid.

the same parameter vector . An estimator b is called Doubly Robust (DR) if b is consistent no
matter which model is correct.

We provide a general technique for constructing doubly robust (DR) estimators, which we call
General Doubly Robust (GDR) estimation. The technique can be immediately extended to triply
robust and general multiply robust models. Our GDR takes the form of a straightforward extension
of Hansen’s (1982) Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator, and we show it has similar
associated root-n asymptotics.
The term double robustness was coined by Robins, Rotnitzky, and van der Laan (2000),
but is based on Scharfstein, Rotnitzky, and Robins (1999) and the augmented inverse probability
weighting average treatment e¤ect estimator introduced by Robins, Rotnitzky, and Zhao (1994). In
their application

is a population Average Treatment E¤ect (ATE). To summarize their application,

has these same bene…ts. Unlike nonparametric estimators, GDR requires no smoothing functions,
tuning parameters, regularization, or penalty functions, and does not raise rates of convergence
issues. And unlike standard parametric models, GDR provides two chances instead of just one to
correctly specify a functional form.

An alternative approach to modeling if one thought that either G

which is generally not consistent unless both G

our GDR avoids these issues.

The main drawback of existing DR estimators is that they are not generic, in that for each
problem one needs to design a speci…c DR estimator, which can then only be used for that one
speci…c application. Speci…cally, existing DR applications require that one …nd some clever way
of expressing

e (Z; ) and H
e (Z; ) that happens to possess the DR
as the mean of functions of G

property. In the ATE example, this expression is given by equation (6), which has the tricky DR
property of equaling the true

e is correctly speci…ed. No general method exists for
if either G

…nding or constructing such equations, and only a very few example of such models are known in
the literature. In contrast, we provide a general method of constructing estimators that have the
DR property.
Existing DR applications express the parameter

e (Z; ), H
e (Z; ), and
as a function of G

e and H
e are conditional mean functions. We further generalize by assuming that the true
Z, where G
value of

satis…es either E [G (Z; ; )] = 0 or E [H (Z; ; )] = 0 for some known vector valued

functions G and H. Our GDR estimator then consistently estimates , despite not knowing which

3

of these two sets of equalities actually holds, for any functions G and H that satisfy some regularity
and identi…cation conditions.
Unlike existing DR estimators, we do not need to …nd some clever, model speci…c way to
combine these moments. All that is needed to apply our estimator is to know the functions G and
H. For example, for estimation of the average treatment e¤ect , the function G is just embodies
the standard expression for

as the di¤erence in expected outcomes between the treatment and

control groups, while the function H corresponds to just the standard expression of

as the mean

of propensity score weighted outcomes.
Note that we do not claim that our GDR estimator is superior to existing DR estimators in
applications where DR estimators are known to exist. Rather, our primary contribution is providing
a general method for constructing estimators that possess the double robustness property. Also,
our GDR estimator has an extremely simple numerical form, and an ordinary root N consistent,
asymptotically normal limiting distribution. The GDR estimator just consists of minimizing an
objective function that equals the product of two GMM objective functions.
In the next section we describe our GDR estimator. Section 3 then gives four examples
of potential applications. In section 4 we prove consistency of the GDR estimator and provide
limiting distribution theory. Later sections provide an empirical application, and discuss extensions,
including to triply and other mulitply robust estimators.

The GDR Estimator
In this section we describe the GDR estimator (proof of consistency and limiting distribution

theory is provided later). Let Z be a vector of observed random variables, let ,

and

be vectors

of parameters, and assume G and H are known functions. Assume a sample consisting of n iid
observations zi of the vector Z. The goal is root-n consistent estimation of .
Let g0 ( ; )

= 0, or both hold.

Assumption A2 says that either the G model is true or the H model is true (or both are
true), for some unknown true coe¢ cient values

This is a de…ning feature DR

estimators, and hence of our GDR estimator.

Assumptions A2 and A3 are identi…cation assumptions. They imply that if G is the true
model, then the true values of the coe¢ cients f

Assumption A3 rules out the existence of alternative pseudo-true values satisfying the ‘wrong’
moments, e.g., this assumption rules out having both g0 (

= 0 and g0 (

1;

1)

= 0 for some

0.

Note that Assumption A3 is a potentially strong restriction, and is not required by some
existing DR estimators. As our examples later will illustrate, satisfying this assumption generally
requires that parameters be over identi…ed, which in turn typically means that the vector G contains
more elements than the set f ; g, and that the vector H contains more elements than the set
f ; g. Otherwise, as in method of moments estimation, g0 ( ; ) = 0 and h0 ( ; ) = 0 each have as
many equations as unknowns, and so typically a pseudo-true solution will exist for whichever one
is misspeci…ed (if one is), thereby violating Assumption A3.
To de…ne our proposed estimator, we de…ne the following functions

So the GDR objective function is nothing more than the GMM objective function based on the
moments g0 ( ; ) = 0 times the GMM objective function based on the moments h0 ( ; ) = 0.
Regarding the weighting matrix b g and b h , note that usual GMM weight matrices are

not generally optimal in our GDR. We will discuss it at the end of section 5 after discussing the
asymptotic distribution of GDR estimator.

GDR Examples
Before proceeding to show consistency and deriving the limiting distribution of the GDR es-

timator, we consider four example applications. The …rst two examples show how GDR could be
used in place of existing DR applications. The second two examples are new applications for which
no existing DR estimator were known.

3.1

Average Treatment E¤ect
Harking back to the earliest DR estimators like Robins, Rotnitzky, and van der Laan (2000),

Scharfstein, Rotnitzky, and Robins (1999), and Robins, Rotnitzky, and Zhao (1994), here we describe the construction of DR estimates of average treatment e¤ects, as in, e.g., Bang and Robins
(2005), Funk, Westreich, Wiesen, Stürmer, Brookhart, and Davidian (2011), Rose and van der Laan

6

(2014), Lunceford and Davidian (2004), S÷
oczyński and Wooldridge (2018) and Wooldridge (2007).
We then show how this model could alternatively be estimated using our GDR construction.
The assumption in this application is that either the conditional mean of the outcome or
the propensity score of treatment is correctly parametrically speci…ed. Let Z = fY; T; Xg where Y
is an outcome, T is a binary treatment indicator, and X is a J vector of other covariates (including
a constant). The average treatment e¤ect we wish to estimate is
= EfE(Y jT = 1; X)

E(Y jT = 0; X)g.

Construction of this doubly robust estimator required …nding an expression like equation

(6) that is special to the problem at hand. In general, …nding such expressions for any particular
problem may be di¢ cult or impossible.
In contrast, our proposed GDR estimator does not require any such creativity. All that
is required for constructing the GDR for this problem is to know the two alternative standard
estimators, based on equations (2) and (3), expressed in GMM form, i.e., equation (4) and equation
(5). Just de…ne G(Z; ; ) to be the vector of functions given in equation (4) and de…ne H(Z; ; )
to be the vector of functions given in equation (5). That is,

These functions can then be plugged into the expressions in the previous section to obtain our GDR
estimator, equation (1), without having to …nd an expression like equation (6) with its di¢ cult to
satisfy properties.
The vector r2 (X) can include any functions of X as long as the corresponding moments
EfH(Z; ; )g exist. To satisfy Assumption A3, we will want to choose r2 (X) to include Je el-

ements where Je is strictly greater than J. What we require is that, if the propensity score is
incorrectly speci…ed, then there is no

;

(in the set of permitted values) that satis…es the mo-

ments EfH(Z; ; )g = 0, while, if the propensity score is correctly speci…ed, then the only

An Instrumental Variables Additive Regression Model
Okui, Small, Tan, and Rubins (2012) propose a DR estimator for an instrumental variables

(IV) additive regression model. The model is the additive regression
e
Y = M (W; ) + G(X)
+ U;

(11)

E (U j X; Q) = 0;

(12)

e
E(Q j X) = H(X);

where Y is an observed outcome variable, W is a S vector of observed exogenous covariates, X
is a J vector of observed confounders, and Q is a K

J vector of observed instruments. Note

that this model has features that are unusual for instrumental variables estimation, in particular,
the assumption that E (U j X; Q) = 0 is stronger than the usual E (U j Q) = 0 assumption. The
function M (W; ) is assumed to be correctly parameterized, and the goal is estimation of :

In place of the Okui, Small, Tan, and Rubins (2012) DR construction, we could estimate this
model using the GDR estimator, equation (1), with G and H given by equations (13) and (14). To
satisfy Assumption A3, r1 (X) needs to include more than S + J

K elements, and r2 (X) needs to

include more than J elements. So, e.g., we would want to include at least one more function of X

Preference Parameter Estimates
One of the original applications of GMM estimation was the estimation of marginal utility

parameters and of pricing kernels. See, e.g., Hansen and Singleton (1982) or Cochrane (2001).
Consider a lifetime utility function of the form
( T
)
X
u =E
bt Rt U (Ct ; Xt ; ) j W
t=0

where u is expected discounted lifetime utility in time period , b is the subjective rate of time
preference, Rt is the time t gross returns from a traded asset, U is the single period utility function,
Ct is observable consumption expenditures in time t, Xt is a vector of other observable covariates
that a¤ect utility,

is a vector of utility parameters, and W is a vector of variables that are

observable in time period . Maximization of this expected utility function under a life time budget
constraining yields Euler equations of the form
E

bRt+1

U 0 (Ct+1 ; Xt+1 ; )
U 0 (Ct ; Xt ; )
11

1

jW

=0

(15)

where U 0 (Ct ; Xt ; ) denotes @U (Ct ; Xt ; ) =@Ct . If the functional form of U 0 is known, then this
equation provides moments that allow b and

to be estimated using GMM. But suppose we have

two di¤erent possible speci…cations of U 0 , and we do not know which speci…cation is correct. Then
our GDR estimator can be immediately applied, replacing the expression in the inner parentheses
in equation (15) with G(Z; ; ) or H(Z; ; ) to represent the two di¤erent speci…cations. Here
would represent parameters that are same in either speci…cation, including the subjective rate of
time preference b.
To give a speci…c example, a standard speci…cation of utility is constant relative risk aversion
with habit formation, where utility takes the form
U (Ct ; Xt ; ) =

fCt

M (Xt )g1
1

where Xt is a vector of lagged values of Ct , the parameter

1

is coe¢ cient of risk aversion, and

the function M (Xt ) is the habit function. See, e.g., Campbell and Cochrane (1999) or Chen and
Ludvigson (2009). While this general functional form has widespread acceptance and use, there is
considerable debate about the correct functional form for M , including whether Xt should include
the current value of Ct or just lagged values. See, e.g., the debate about whether habits are internal
or external as discussed in the above papers. Rather than take a stand on which habit model is
correct, we could estimate the model by GDR.
To illustrate, suppose that with internal habits the function M (Xt ) would be given by
e (Xt ; ), where G
e is the internal habits functional form. Similarly, suppose with external habits
G

e (Xt ; ) where H
e is the external habits speci…cation. Then, based on
M (Xt ) would be given by H
equation (15), we could de…ne G(Z; ; ) and H(Z; ; ) by

rate b and the coe¢ cient risk aversion , no matter which habit model is correct. To help satisfy
Assumption A3, we would generally want W to have more elements than ( ; ) and more than
( ; ).

Alternative Sets of Instruments
Consider a parametric model
Y = M (W; ) +

where Y is an outcome, W is vector of observed covariates, M is a known functional form,
vector of parameters to be estimated, and

is a

di¤erent vectors of observed covariates that are candidate instruments. One may be unsure if either
R or Q are valid instrument vectors are not, where validity is de…ned as being uncorrelated with .
We may then de…ne model G by E ( R) = 0, so G(Z; ) = fY
model H by E ( Q) = 0, so H(Z; ) = fY

M (W; )g R and de…ne

M (W; )g Q. With these de…nition we can then

immediately apply the GDR estimator. In this case both

and

are empty, but more generally,

the variables R and Q could themselves be functions of covariates and of parameters

respectively.
To give an example, consider a model based on Lewbel (2012). Suppose Y = X

A standard instrumental variables based estimator for this model would consist of …nding
one or more covariates L such that E ( L) = 0. Then the set of instruments R would be de…ned
by R = fX; Lg. The equivalent GMM estimator would be based on the moments EfG(Z; )g =

A special case of this estimator (corresponding to a speci…c choice of the GMM weighting matrix) is
standard linear two stage least squares estimation. The main di¢ culty with applying this estimator
is that one must …nd one or more covariates L to serve as instruments. De…ning L have more than
one element results in more moments than parameters, helping to satisfy Assumption A3.
To illustrate, consider Engel curve estimation (see Lewbel 2008 for a short survey, and
references therein). Suppose Y is a consumer’s expenditures on food, X is a vector of covariates
that a¤ect the consumer’s tastes, and S is the consumer’s total consumption expenditures (i.e.,
their total budget which must be allocated between food and non-food expenditures). Suppose, as
is commonly the case, that S is observed with some mismeasurement error. Then a possible and
commonly employed set of instruments L consist of functions of the consumer’s income. However,
validity of functions of income as instruments for total consumption depends on an assumption of
separability between the consumer’s decisions on savings and their food expenditure decision, which
may or may not be valid.
An alternative method of obtaining potential instruments is by exploiting functional form
related assumptions. Lewbel (2012) shows that, under some conditions (including standard assumptions regarding classical measurement error), one may construct a set of potential instruments using
the following procedure: Linearly regress S on X, and obtain the residuals from that regression.
De…ne a vector of instruments P to be demeaned X (excluding the constant) times these residuals.
This constructed vector P , along with X, would then the set of instruments used to construct a
GMM estimator. This estimator is implemented in the STATA module IVREG2H by Baum and
Scha¤er (2012).
Let X denote the vector X with the constant removed. Algebraically, we can write the
instruments obtained in this way as R = fX; P g where P = (X
14

1 ) (S

X 0 2 ), and where the

vectors

1

and

2

in turn satisfy E (X

1)

= 0 and E fX (S

X 0 2 )g = 0. An e¢ cient estimator

based on this construction would be standard GMM using the moments E fH(Z; ; )g = 0 where
H(Z; ; ) is a vector that consists of the stacked vectors

The estimator will have more moments than parameters if X has more than one element. As shown
in Lewbel (2012), one set of conditions under which the instruments P are valid (yielding consistency
of this estimator) if the measurement error in S is classical and if a component of is homoscedastic.
So this estimator does not require …nding a covariate from outside the model like income to use an
instrument, but still could be inconsistent if the measurement error or homoskedasticity assumptions
do not hold.
The moments given by E fG(Z; )g = 0 or E fH(Z; ; )g = 0 correspond to very di¤erent sets of identifying conditions. GDR estimation based on these moments therefore allows for
consistent estimation of

if either of these sets of conditions hold.

The GDR Estimator Asymptotics
Here we show identi…cation and consistency of our GDR estimator.

4.1

GDR Identi…cation and Consistency
To show consistency of b, we apply Theorem 2.1 in Newey and McFadden (1994), which

provides a set of standard su¢ cient conditions for consistency of extremum estimators. For an
objective function Q( ), their conditions include (a) Q( ) is uniquely maximized at

(b)

following Lemma 1 establishes this identi…cation condition for

on which moment condition is correctly speci…ed.

Qg0 ( ; ) = fWg g0 ( ; )g0 fWg g0 ( ; )g > Qg0 (

if A2-2) holds then Qh0 ( ; ) has a unique minimum at f

which cannot hold because Qg0 and Qh0 must be nonnegative. Therefore in this case f

then by A3 and by Qg0 and Qh0 being quadratics, we again get a contradiction, so in this

To satisfy the remaining conditions of Theorem 2.1 in Newey and McFadden (1994), continuity and uniform convergence, we make the following additional assumptions.

Fadden (1994). Conditions 1-2 of Theorem 2.1 in Newey and McFadden follow by A1-3 and Lemma

Empirical Application: Engel Curve Estimation

Here we consider the example discussed in section 3.4. Y is a consumer’s expenditures on food, X is
a vector of covariates that a¤ect the consumer’s tastes, and S is the consumer’s total consumption
expenditures (i.e., their total budget which must be allocated between food and non-food expenditures). The budget S is observed with some mismeasurement error. L consists of two or more
functions of the consumer’s income.
