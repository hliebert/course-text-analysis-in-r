Derivations

To derive equation (12) from equation (11), consider the level of utility the individual obtains if
she optimally chooses m (q; θ ) subject to a budget constraint in which she must pay γ (q) to obtain
insurance:
V (q) = maxm(q;θ ) E [u (y (θ ) − x (q, m (q; θ )) − γ (q) , h (m (q; θ ) ; θ ))] ,

(26)

where the expectation is taken with regard to θ . The envelope theorem implies:

Given that V (q) = E [u (c (0; θ ) , h (0; θ ))] for all q by equation (11), it follows that dV /dq = 0.

which was what we wanted to show. Note that this derivation does not require medical spending
to be strictly positive; in other words, individuals can be at a corner solution. The derivation
also allows for cases where there are “lumpy” medical expenditures so that an individual is not
indifferent between an additional $1 of out-of-pocket medical spending and $1 less consumption.22
Intuitively, the individual values the mechanical relaxation of the budget constraint from Medicaid
according to the marginal utility of consumption, regardless of the extent to which she has ability
to substitute an increase in another good (e.g., medical care) for the increase in consumption.
22 Although

the optimization requires individuals to equalize the marginal cost and marginal benefit of additional
medical spending, we did not require concavity in the health production function, and we allow for insurance to
affect medical spending in a discontinuous or lumpy fashion. Non-concavities in the health production function and
non-convexities in the out-of-pocket spending schedule could lead to discontinuities in the marginal utilities (e.g., the
marginal utility of consumption may jump up at the point of deciding to increase medical spending by a discontinuous
amount in order to undergo an expensive medical procedure), but the equation for γ (q) in integral form will remain
continuous because, when the individual is at the margin of undertaking the jump, the individual will be indifferent to
undertaking the jump or not.

This derivation is based on individuals facing a budget constraint in which they pay γ (q) for
insurance. If in reality, they do not have to pay γ (q) and the demand for m has a nonzero income
elasticity, the observed choices of m will differ from those used in this derivation and, as a result,
this derivation is not exact. In practice, however, this issue does not affect our estimates because
our estimates are based on a linear interpolation of dγ/dq between q = 0 and q = 1. At q = 0, γ
is zero and therefore the observed choices of m are the same whether or not individuals have to
pay γ. At q = 1, individuals are fully insured and the marginal insurance value is zero in any case.
The only estimate for which this issue does arise is the specification check discussed in column VI
of Appendix Table 4, in which we do not assume that individuals are fully insured at q = 1 (i.e.,
where they have strictly positive out-of-pocket spending at q = 1). The next subsection contains an
alternative setup, in which individuals face insurance lotteries. In this alternative setup, the above
formula for dγ/dq holds exactly.
Derivation in an alternative setup: insurance lotteries
In order to satisfy the maximization in equation (11), the relevant arguments of the marginal utility
function, uc , need to be the choices that individuals in state θ would actually make if they face
price p (q), have income y (θ ), and pay γ (q). Observed choices do not satisfy this maximization
if individuals, in fact, do not pay γ (q). Intuitively, for q > 0, there would be income effects that
cause people to change their allocation of c and m. In practice, in our baseline implementation this
is not a problem, since we assume x(1, m) = 0 – and therefore we know the pure-insurance term (as
defined in equation (13)) must be zero on the margin for the fully insured – and linearly interpolate
dγ
at q = 0 and q = 1.
between our estimates of dq
More generally though, we can derive the optimization implementation for a thought experiment in which we consider the willingness to pay to avoid an ε-chance of losing Medicaid (and
returning to q = 0). In this alternative setup, we define γ (q) as 1/ε times the willingness to pay to
avoid an ε-chance of losing q units of insurance, with ε → 0. Formally: γ (q) solves for ε → 0:
E [u (c (q; θ ) − εγ (q) , h (q; θ ))] = (1 − ε) E [u (c (q; θ ) , h (q; θ ))] + εE [u (c (0; θ ) , h (0; θ ))] . (27)

Now, noting that − ∂∂ qx = (p (1) − p (0)) m (q; θ ), we obtain equation (12).
Alternative derivation: using the first-order condition
Given the central role of equation (12) in the optimization approaches, we also derive equation (12)
by exploiting the first-order condition. This derivation requires the first-order condition (equation
(17)) to hold with equality and is therefore less general than our main derivation, which is based
on the envelope theorem. However, the derivation based on the first-order condition very nicely
shows the intuition behind the optimization approaches, and we therefore present it here.
To derive equation (12) from equation (11), it is useful to first derive two intermediate expressions. First, we differentiate the budget constraint c (q; θ ) = y (θ ) − x (q, m (q; θ )) with respect to

Instrumental variable analysis of the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment data

This section provides some additional information on how we analyze the data from the Oregon
Medicaid lottery. Much more detail on the data and the lottery can be found in Finkelstein et al.
(2012)[11].
A.2.1

Estimation of impacts

As described in Section 3.1, we estimate the impact of Medicaid on outcomes by IV, where an
indicator for being selected by the lottery is the instrument. When analyzing the mean impact of
Medicaid on an individual outcome yi (such as medical spending mi , out-of-pocket spending xi , or
health hi ), we estimate equations of the following form:
23 Note that the first-order condition requires that the arguments of u

c and uh be the choices that the individual makes
facing p (q) and paying γ(q); in general, one would also subtract γ (q) from their income and allow individuals to reoptimize; but as discussed above, we abstract from these income effect issues and instead motivate γ with an insurance
lottery interpretation.

yi = α0 + α1 Medicaidi + εi ,

(30)

where Medicaid is an indicator variable for whether the individual is covered by Medicaid at any
point in the study period. We estimate equation (30) by two-stage least squares, using the following
first-stage equation:
Medicaidi = β0 + β1 Lotteryi + νi ,

(31)

in which the excluded instrument is the variable “Lottery,” which is an indicator variable for
whether the individual was selected by the lottery. Winning the lottery increased the probability of being on Medicaid at any time during the subsequent year by about 30 percentage points.
This “first-stage” effect of lottery selection on Medicaid coverage was below one because many
lottery winners either did not apply for Medicaid or were deemed ineligible.
Previous work has used the lottery as an instrument for Medicaid to examine the impact of
Medicaid on health care utilization, financial well-being, labor market outcomes, health, and private insurance coverage (Finkelstein et al. (2012)[11], Baicker et al. (2013)[5], Baicker et al.
(2014)[4], and Taubman et al. (2014)[24]). Finkelstein et al. (2012)[11] provides supporting
evidence on the assumptions required to use the lottery as an instrument for Medicaid coverage.
One particular feature of the lottery design affects our implementation. Although the lottery
selected individuals, any member of these individuals’ households could apply for Medicaid. As a
result, if more people from a household were on the waiting list, the household had more “lottery
tickets” and a higher chance of being selected. The lottery was thus random conditional on the
number of people in the household who were on the waiting list, which we refer to as the number
of “lottery tickets.” In practice, about 60 percent of the individuals on the list were in households
with one ticket, and virtually all the remainder had two tickets. (We drop the less than 0.5 percent
who had three tickets; no one had more). In households with two tickets, the variable “Lottery”
is one if any household member was selected by the lottery. In all of our analysis, therefore, we
perform the estimation separately for one-ticket and two-ticket households. Because there is no
natural or interesting distinction between these two sets of households, all estimates presented in
the paper consist of the weighted average of the estimates for these two groups.
Much of our analysis is based on estimates of characteristics of treatment and/or control compliers – i.e., those who are covered by Medicaid if and only if they win the lottery (see, e.g., Angrist and Pischke (2009)[3]). Our estimation of these characteristics is standard (see, e.g., Abadie
(2002)[1]; Abadie (2003)[2]; and Angrist and Pischke (2009)[3]). For example, uninsured individuals who won the lottery provide estimates of characteristics of never-takers. Since uninsured
individuals who lost the lottery include both control compliers and never-takers, with estimates of

the never-taker sample and the share of individuals who are compliers, we can back out the characteristics of control compliers. Likewise, insured individuals who lost the lottery provide estimates
of characteristics of always-takers. Since insured lottery winners include both treatment compliers
and always-takers, we can in like manner identify the characteristics of treatment compliers. Differences between treatment and control compliers reflect the impact of Medicaid (i.e., α1 ) in the
IV estimation of equation (30).
To make this more concrete, let fg (x) denote the probability density function (pdf) of x for
group g ∈ {TC,CC, AT, NT } where TC are the treatment compliers, CC are the control compliers,
AT are the always-takers, and NT are the never-takers. We observe fNT (x), the distribution of x
for the never-takers, as the distribution of x for those who choose not to take up in the treatment
group. The population fraction of never-takers, πNT , is given by the fraction of the treatment group
that did not take up the program. Similarly, fAT (x), the distribution of x for the always-takers, is
given by the observed distribution of x for those who choose to take up in the control group, and
the population fraction of always-takers, πAT , is given by the fraction of the control group that took
up the program.
The population fraction of compliers is given by: πC = 1 − πNT − πAT . However, the distribution of x for compliers requires more work to calculate and differs for compliers in the control
group and those in the treatment group. In the control group, those choosing not to take up are
a mixture of never-takers and control compliers (those who would take up if offered). Using
the observed distribution of x for never-takers (see above), we can back out fCC (x), the distribution of x for the compliers in the control group, by noting that the distribution of x for those

who don’t take up the program in the control group is given by: πC +π
NT
NT
Similarly, those who take up the program in the treatment group are a mixture of always-takers
and treatment compliers. Using the observed distribution of x for always-takers (see above), we
can back out fTC (x), the distribution of x for the compliers in the treatment group, by noting
that the distribution of x for those who take up the program in the treatment group is given by:
πC
πAT
πC +πAT f TC (x) + πC +πAT f AT (x). So, for example, one can solve for the treatment complier mean,
πC
AT
µTC , using the equation πC +π
µTC + πCπ+π
µAT = µT T , where µT T is the observed mean of x of
AT
AT
those in the treatment group who take up the program and µAT is the observed mean of those who
take up the program in the control group. This yields:
µTC =

(πC + πAT )µT T − πAT µAT
.
πC

Similarly, the formula for control complier means is given by:
µCC =

(πC + πNT )µCN − πNT µNT

where µCN and µNT denote the observed mean of x among those who do not take up the program
in the control group and treatment group, respectively. These formulas were used to compute the
complier means presented in the text.
A.2.2

Estimation of impact on out-of-pocket spending distribution

To estimate the distribution of out-of-pocket spending for the treatment and control compliers in
our relatively small sample, we follow a parametric IV technique. Fortunately, reported out-ofpocket spending closely follows a log-normal distribution combined with a mass at zero spending.
Therefore, we approximate the distribution of out-of-pocket spending by assuming that out-ofpocket spending is a mixture of a mass point at zero and a log-normal spending distribution for
strictly positive values. We allow the parameters of this mixture distribution to differ across four
groups: treatment compliers (TC) , control compliers (CC), always-takers (AT ), and never-takers
(NT ). Specifically, let Fxg denote the CDF of out-of-pocket spending for group g:

Fxg (x|ψ g , µ g , ν g ) = ψ g + (1 − ψ g ) LOGN (x|µ g , ν g )

f or g ∈ {TC,CC, AT, NT }

where LOGN (x|µ, ν) is the CDF of a log-normal distribution with mean and variance parameters,
µ and ν, evaluated at x > 0. For x = 0, the CDF is given solely by ψ g , so that this parameter
captures the fraction of group g with zero out-of-pocket spending. Under standard IV assumptions,
the 12 parameters are identified from the joint distribution of out-of-pocket spending, insurance
status, and lottery status. (In practice, we estimate F g separately for households with 1 and 2
lottery tickets, and therefore estimate 24 parameters).24 We estimate all parameters jointly using
maximum likelihood using the approach laid out in subsection A.2.1. To assess the goodness of
fit, Figure A1 plots the estimated and actual CDF separately based on lottery status (won or lost),
insurance status, and number of tickets. As can be seen from these figures, the parametric model
fits quite well.
A.2.3

Results and comparison to previous results

Our sample, variable definitions, and estimation approach are slightly different from those in
Finkelstein et al. (2012)[11]. Appendix Table 3 walks through the differences in the approaches
and shows that these differences are fairly inconsequential for the estimates reported in the two papers. Column I replicates the results from Finkelstein et al. (2012)[11]. In column II, we limit the
data to the subsample used in our own analysis, which consists of about 15,500 individuals out of

impose the consumption floor by capping the out-of-pocket spending distribution, as described in Section

the approximately 24,000 individuals from Finkelstein et al. (2012)[11]. Our subsample excludes
those who have missing values for any of the variables we use in the analysis. The primary reason
for the loss of sample size is missing information on prescription drug utilization (a component of
medical spending m). Missing data on self-reported health, household income, number of family
members, out-of-pocket spending, and other health care use also contribute slightly to the reduction of sample size. We also exclude the few people who had three people in the household signed
up for the lottery, as described above.
Column III reports the results on our subsample using our estimating equations above. These
estimating equations differ from those used by Finkelstein et al. (2012)[11] in several ways. First,
we stratify on the number of tickets and report weighted averages of the results rather than include
indicator variables for the number of tickets, as in Finkelstein et al. (2012)[11]; we thus allow
the effects of insurance to potentially differ by number of tickets. Second, we do not control for
which of the 8 different survey waves the data come from as in Finkelstein et al. (2012)[11].25
And finally, we do not up-weight the subsample of individuals in the intensive-follow-up survey
arm. As shown in column III, these deviations do not meaningfully affect the results.
Finally, Column IV reports the results using our subsample and our estimating equation, adjusting the “raw” out-of-pocket data as described in Section 4. Specifically, we estimate the distribution of out-of-pocket spending by fitting the parametric distribution described above and shown
in Figure A1; we set out-of-pocket spending to zero for the insured; and we impose a ceiling on
out-of-pocket spending for the uninsured. Naturally, these adjustments only affect the estimated
effect of Medicaid on out-of-pocket spending. The combination of these changes increases the estimated impact of Medicaid on out-of-pocket spending from -$350 to -$569, primarily as a result of
setting out-of-pocket spending to zero for the insured. In particular, simply replacing x = 0 for the
insured in the raw data in column III increases the estimated impact of Medicaid on out-of-pocket
spending from -$350 to -$581. Imposing the parametric model and consumption floor (of $1,977)
moves this estimate from -$581 to -$569.

A.3

Decomposition of γ (1) in the complete-information approach

To provide insights into the drivers of the estimate of γ (1), we decompose γ(1) into γC and γh as
described in Section (4.1.2). We can further decompose the components associated with consumption effects (γC ) and effects on health (γh ) into a transfer and a pure-insurance component. We
estimate the consumption transfer term (γC,Trans f er ) as the mean increase in consumption due to
the program so that
25 Covariates

are more difficult to handle in our estimates of the distributional impact of Medicaid on out-of-pocket
spending (and, hence, consumption), so we stratify by ticket size in the analyses of effects on distributions. We do the
same thing for our mean estimates for consistency.

γC,Trans f er = E[c (1; θ ) − c(0; θ )].

(32)

The pure-insurance component operating through consumption (γC,Ins ) is then:
γC,Ins = γC − γC,Trans f er .

(33)

By substituting the health production function (equation (2)) into the definition of γ (equation
(4)), we can in principle decompose the component due to effects on health (γh ) into a transfer component (γh,Trans f er ) and an insurance component (γh,Ins = γh − γh,Trans f er ). The transfer component
in health (γh,Trans f er ) is given by:

Health measures and their mapping to QALYs

Methodological approaches to mapping health measures to QALYs
There is an extensive literature on the measurement of QALYs. A good overview of this literature
and the principal issues involved is given by Whitehead and Ali (2010)[27] and Brazier et al.
(2010)[7]. QALYs are defined such that a life-year in perfect health is counted as one QALY and
being dead in a given year counts as a QALY of zero. The challenge lies in assigning a QALY to
a year lived in less-than-perfect health. Both principal methods used for this rely on self-reported
preferences over hypotheticals. The “Standard-Gamble” method elicits a probability υ such that a
57

respondent reports being indifferent between living in a particular health state and facing a gamble
consisting of living in perfect health with probability υ and being dead with probability 1 − υ. One
year lived in this particular health state is assigned a QALY of υ. The “Time-Trade-Off” method
elicits the value of υ for which the respondent is indifferent between living for some number of
years (call this Z years) in a particular health state and living for νZ years in perfect health. One
year lived in this particular health state is assigned a QALY of υ. In short, QALYs are designed to
aggregate life-years taking the quality of those life-years into account.
Baseline: Mapping self-assessed health to QALYs
We use the estimates by Van Doorslaer and Jones (2003)[25] to map the responses to our baseline
self-assessed health measure into QALYs. Van Doorslaer and Jones use about 15,000 observations from the 1994-1995 wave of the Canadian “National Population Health Survey” (NPHS).
The NPHS contains the same self-assessed health question as in our Oregon data. In addition, the
NPHS contains the standard set of more detailed health questions that are used to form the McMaster University “Health Utilities Index Mark 3” (HUI3). The HUI3 is a cardinal health scale that
runs between zero and one and was constructed using the “Standard-Gamble” method based on
responses of about 500 adults randomly selected from the general population of the City of Hamilton, Canada. This means that a year lived in a health state where HUI3=ν translates into ν QALYs.
Details on the construction of the HUI3 are described in Furlong et al. (1998)[12]. Van Doorslaer
and Jones (2003)[25] estimate how responses to the self-assessed health question correspond to the
HUI3. We use their preferred estimates, which are based on interval regression methods to assign
QALYs to responses to our self-assessed health variable. These estimates (their Table 4) show that
a year lived in “poor health” corresponds to 0.4010 QALYs, “fair health” to 0.7070 QALYs, “good
health” to 0.8410 QALYs, “very good health” to 0.9311 QALYs, and “excellent health” to 0.9833
QALYs.
Mapping responses to the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) to QALYs
The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) measures mental health. It consists of a number of questions that have the following structure: “Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by X? Would you say it was. . . ” Each question substitutes a different symptom for X, namely:
“having little interest or pleasure in doing things,” “feeling down, depressed, or hopeless,” “trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much,” “feeling tired or having little energy,” “poor
appetite or overeating,” “feeling bad about yourself, or that you’re a failure, or have let yourself or
your family down,” “trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching
TV,” and “moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed? Or the opposite 58

being so fidgety or restless that you have been moving around a lot more than usual?”. The 2-item
PHQ-2 asked on the mail-in survey contains the first two symptoms listed above. The PHQ-8 asked
during the in-person survey contains all 8 symptoms listed above.
Possible responses to each question are “not at all,” “several days,” “more than half the days,”
“nearly every day,” “don’t know,” and “prefer not to answer.” The PHQ scoring method is that, on
each item, “not at all” gets a score of 0, “several days” gets a score of 1, “more than half the days”
gets a score of 2, and “nearly every day” gets a score of 3. The total score is simply the sum of the
item scores.
We convert PHQ scores to QALYs by relying on estimates from Pyne et al. (2009)[20]. Pyne et
al. (2009)[20] convert the PHQ-8 responses to QALYs using the “Standard Gamble” methodology.
Specifically, they ask 95 randomly sampled adults from the Central Arkansas area to evaluate three
vignettes of people with different degrees of depression. Each of these vignettes is described in
terms of the frequency of the symptoms that constitute the items of the PHQ. Hence, each of these
vignettes can readily be scored on the PHQ scale. Vignette A has a PHQ-8 score of 5, vignette
B has a score of 10, and vignette C has a score of 24. Table 1 of Pyne et al. (2009)[20] show
that living a year in the health condition described by vignette A corresponds to 0.78 QALYs.
Vignette B corresponds to 0.70 QALYs and vignette C to 0.54 QALYs. These three vignettes
therefore define QALYs for three scores on the PHQ-8 scale. By definition, a fully healthy person
(with a PHQ-8 of zero) corresponds to a QALY of 1. We linearly interpolate the PHQ-8 to QALY
correspondence for intermediate values of the PHQ-8 score. To map the PHQ-2 to QALYs, we
first multiply the PHQ-2 score by 4 to make it comparable to the PHQ-8 score, and then apply the
same PHQ-8 to QALY correspondence.
Mapping responses to the Short Form questions to QALYs
The in-person survey contains the questions from the 8-item version of Short Form health questionnaire (SF-8). The SF-8 questionnaire contains questions that ask the respondent about any
experiences of physical and mental health issues in the past four weeks.26 We translate responses
to the SF-8 into a summary physical health score and a summary mental health score using the
methodology developed by the designers of the SF-8 questionnaire (Ware et al. (2001)[26]). To
map the two SF-8 summary measures in to a single measure on a QALY scale, we use the conversion formula estimated by Sullivan and Ghushchyan (2006)[23], as described on page 407 of their
article. They estimate their conversion formula using 37,000 observations from the 2000 and 2002
waves of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). These waves of the MEPS contain both
a SF health questionnaire and a cardinal health measure, the so-called EQ-5D index score, which

Measuring consumption and estimating the pure-insurance term using
national data

A.5.1

Consumption measure from the CEX

This subsection details the data used to estimate the covariance term in the consumption optimization approach using the CEX. The CEX consists of a series of short panels. Each “consumer unit”
(CU) is interviewed every 3 months over 5 calendar quarters. In the initial interview, information is
collected on demographic and family characteristics and on the consumer unit’s inventory of major durable goods. Expenditure information is collected in the second through the fifth interviews
using uniform questionnaires. Income and employment information is collected in the second and
fifth interviews.
Our sample includes all CUs in 1996-2010 who have valid expenditure data in all 4 quarters
(i.e., positive total expenditure and non-negative medical expenditure) and non-missing income
data. To be broadly consistent with the Oregon sample, we further limit the analysis to families
that are headed by an adult aged 19-64 and are below 100% of the federal poverty line. We measure
insurance status q at the start of the survey28 , regardless of whether or not the individual obtains
insurance later in the year (results are quite similar if we use concurrent insurance status). Because
the CEX requests information on the health insurance status only of the household head, we restrict
the sample to single adults with no children in the household, so that we can identify the individuals
who are insured (q = 1) and uninsured (q = 0). We convert all dollar amounts to 2009-dollars,
and impose an annual consumption floor (although in practice the baseline consumption floor of
$1,977 never binds).
Appendix Table 1 reports the summary statistics for the sample and compares it to the sample of
compliers in the Oregon data. The CEX sample is slightly older, naturally has smaller family size
(because of our limitation to singles), and tends to have somewhat lower out-of-pocket spending
($395 versus $569).

(q = 0). Here, our primary concern is mismeasurement of out-of-pocket spending, x (0; θ ). In
particular, we assume the observed out-of-pocket spending is given by
x̂ (q; θ ) = x (q; θ ) + ε (q; θ ) ,
where ε (q; θ ) is a measurement-error shock to an individual of type θ that is drawn from a distribution with unknown functional form that, importantly, may be correlated with the marginal utility
of consumption.
We identify the covariance term even under this fairly general measurement-error structure
by making three assumptions. First, we assume (non-medical) consumption is measured without error. Second, we assume that the covariance of the marginal utility of consumption and the
measurement error is the same for the insured and uninsured.29 Third, we assume that true outof-pocket medical spending is zero for the insured, so that x̂ (1; θ ) = ε (1; θ ). In other words, we
allow for measurement error in x̂ that is additive in x, arbitrarily correlated with c, and common
for the insured and uninsured. These assumptions would be satisfied, for example, if ε reflected
consumption of uncovered healthcare for both the insured and uninsured (e.g., over-the-counter
pain killers, or transportation costs associated with medical care) and these are consumed in equal
amounts by both groups.
This approach yields an intuitive estimation strategy: we use the estimated covariance term for
the insured as an estimate of the contribution of measurement error to the covariance term of the

uninsured. In particular, our assumptions imply that the observed covariance between E c(0;θ
[c(0;θ )−σ ]
and x̂ (0; θ ) is the sum of the true covariance (which should be zero) and the measurement-error
component:

Alternative measurement error correction.

An alternative approach to correct for measurement error in x̂ would be to use an instrumental variable. Because no natural instrument presents itself in the CEX, we also developed an alternative
measurement error correction strategy relying on a different dataset. Specifically, we use PSID data
on whether the individual reports having gone to the hospital as an instrument for out-of-pocket
spending. The drawback of this approach is that it may not recover the covariance of interest. By
using hospitalization as an instrument, we obtain the correlation of consumption and out-of-pocket
medical spending that is induced through hospitalization, which may not be representative of the
overall correlation. For example, the consumption response to shocks, θ , that lead to hospitalization may be different from the response to shocks that don’t result in hospitalization. We therefore
view the approach using PSID data as a complement to the CEX analysis.
Sample and variables
For our baseline specification, we consider the sample of all household heads between the ages of
25-64 with non-missing reports for hospitalization and consumption data drawn from the biennial
waves of the PSID from 2003-2013. To better align with the low-income population in the Oregon
sample, we restrict the sample to households with per capita household income below $20,000.
This yields 6,600 observations from 3,715 unique household heads, as reported in Appendix Table
6.
We define consumption expenditure as the sum of all expenditures available in the PSID excluding health expenditures (food, rent/home expenses, car expenses) normalized where appropriate to arrive at an annual expenditure measure.30 We divide this consumption by the number
of household members to arrive at per capita consumption, c.31 We define out-of-pocket medical
30 For

example, the survey asks about transportation costs, such as parking fees, for the last month; in contrast,
it generally asks food costs in the past year. We scale transportation costs by 12 to arrive at an annual measure of
expenditure.
31 As noted in previous literature (Li et al. (2010)[17]), the PSID contains roughly 70% of the consumption expenditure that is captured by the CEX. We have also conducted results using solely food expenditure to estimate the
relationship between consumption and medical spending, and obtained similar results.

expenditure as the sum of hospital and nursing costs, doctor and dental costs, and prescription
drug costs for the past two years divided by two. Again, we divide this expenditure number by
the number of household members to arrive at per capita out-of-pocket medical expenditures. For
our baseline specification, we winsorize per capita consumption, c, and per capita out-of-pocket
medical expenditure, x, at the 1st and 99th percentiles. All dollar variables are deflated to 2009
using the CPI-U-RS. Finally, we let Z denote an indicator for any hospitalization of the household
head in the past 12 months.
Appendix Table 6 reports the summary statistics for the sample. Average per capita consumption expenditure is $5,351, which is substantially lower than per capita consumption in the Oregon
sample. This large difference in consumption expenditure likely reflects the fact that the PSID does
not capture a comprehensive measure of consumption.
Setup
We implement our measurement error correction as follows. We wish to estimate cov

Equation (37) provides a method to recover the covariance term using (a) data on the distribution of
x and (b) data on the relationship between x and c. To most closely align with the Oregon sample,
we take var (x) and E [x] from control compliers in the Oregon sample. These are E [x] = $569 and
std (x) = $543. But, we use data from the PSID to calculate β . To do so, we regress log (c−σ )

on log (x), including controls for an age cubic, quadratic controls for household size, and year
dummies. We use our baseline value of σ = 3. Because there is no reason to expect the effect of
out-of-pocket spending on consumption to depend on insurance status, the estimation sample for β
need not be restricted to the uninsured, and we do not impose this restriction. As insurance status
is only measured in the PSID for household heads, limiting the sample to the uninsured would
only be possible by examining uninsured household heads, which would dramatically reduce our
sample size.
A.5.4

Consumption Covariance Estimates

Appendix Table 2 shows the estimates of the consumption covariance in the CEX data corrected for
measurement error. Column I shows results for our baseline measure of non-health consumption,
which is a broad-based measure. It consists of total expenditure excluding individual expenditures
for health care providers, prescription drugs, and medical devices.32 In columns II and III, we show
results based on alternative definitions of non-health consumption. Specifically, in column II, we
exclude durables within each expenditure category because an expenditure on a durable good leads
to a consumption flow over a longer period of time than that in which the expenditure occurred. In
column III, we create a consumption measure that is limited to expenditures in categories that are
relatively easy to adjust in the short run: food, entertainment, apparel, tobacco, alcohol, personal
care, and reading.
Across all the consumption definitions, the covariances between the marginal utility of consumption and out-of-pocket spending for the uninsured are negative.33 However, the covariance is
more negative for the insured. Applying the measurement error correction approach from equation
(35) yields a covariance between the marginal utility of consumption and out-of-pocket spending
at q = 0 of $265 for our baseline, broad-based measure of consumption (column I); the estimate
based on the consumption measure excluding durables is similar (column II) while the estimate
based on expenditures in relatively easily adjustable categories is substantially lower (column III).
As before, the assumption that Medicaid provides full insurance implies that the pure-insurance
value of Medicaid is 0 at the margin at q = 1 and, using the linear approximation to obtain an
average covariance value over q = 1 to q = 0 yields a pure-insurance value of $133.
As noted above, we also implement the consumption covariance term using data from the PSID,
and an alternative measurement error correction approach based on instrumenting for out-of-pocket
medical spending with hospital admissions. In practice, we obtain similar results using the IV
32 Contributions

to private and public pension programs are part of the standard CEX expenditure measure but we
exclude them from our measure because these correspond to savings rather than to current consumption.
33 Although these results do not include any controls, this negative covariance persists even after controlling for a
rich set of covariates including both time-invariant demographics and time-varying factors like income and wealth, as
well as including consumer-unit fixed effects (results not shown).

approach in the PSID to what is reported here using the CEX data. Appendix Table 7 reports the
results from the PSID approach and illustrates the calculation of the consumption covariance term.
Column I illustrates the OLS relationship between log (x) and log (c−σ ).34 As in the CEX, we find
a negative relationship, with β ≈ −0.2. Taken literally, it would imply a consumption covariance
of -$52. To deal with potential measurement error in the elicitations, we instrument log (x) with
an indicator for hospitalization of the household head in the past 12 months. Column II presents
the results from this IV strategy. We estimate that being hospitalized is associated with an 18%
increase in the marginal utility of consumption (this is a 6% drop in consumption, as σ = 3) and
a 19% increase in out-of-pocket medical spending. This suggests β ≈ 1. Combining this estimate
with E [x] and var (x) from the Oregon data yields a value of the consumption covariance term
at q = 0 of $495. Dividing by 2 for the linear interpolation between q = 0 and q = 1 results in
an estimated consumption covariance term of $248 (s.e.: $138), which is larger but statistically
indistinguishable from our baseline estimate using the CEX approach of $133.

To implement the health-based optimization approach and to exactly decompose the completeinformation estimate into a transfer and a pure-insurance term, we would need to estimate the
health returns to medical spending conditional on medical spending, m, and state of the world, θ .
To get causal estimates, we use the Medicaid lottery as an instrument for medical spending. The
challenge lies in capturing heterogeneity in the health returns to medical spending. In the working
paper version (Finkelstein, Hendren, and Luttmer (2015)[10]), we estimated heterogeneity in ∂∂mh̃
by assuming that differences in the returns to medical spending can be captured by differences
in state variables, θ K , that were based on measures of financial and health states from an initial
survey (fielded essentially concurrently with the lottery). Even though we allowed for only four
states of the world, we lacked sufficient statistical power to estimate a sufficiently significant first
stage separately by state. As a result, the IV estimates of ∂∂mh̃ by θ K , and the estimates of γ(1) that
depend on them, are not sufficiently credible to report in the current paper.

Sensitivity Analysis

In this Section, we explore sensitivity to a number of key assumptions. Such “specification” uncertainty is not reflected in the standard errors in Table 3; the sensitivity analysis here provides an
informal way of gauging sensitivity to these assumptions.

B.1

Alternative assumptions unrelated to health

Appendix Table 4 explores the sensitivity of our results within each framework (shown in different
rows) to a number of different non-health assumptions (shown in different columns). For the sake
of brevity, we focus the discussion on two main estimates: recipients’ willingness to pay out of
consumption to obtain Medicaid (i.e., γ(1)), and the ratio of recipient willingness to pay to net
costs (i.e., γ(1)/C). Column I shows our baseline results from Table 3.
Risk aversion and consumption floor. Our baseline analysis uses a coefficient of relative risk
aversion of 3 and a consumption floor of $1,977.35 Columns II through V explore alternative
choices for risk aversion (coefficients of relative risk aversion of 1 and 5) and the consumption floor (of $1,000 or $5,000). A lower consumption floor increases γ(1) using the completeinformation approach or the consumption-based optimization approach using the consumption
proxy because it exposes recipients to greater downside risk. There is no effect on the estimate
from the consumption-based optimization approach using the CEX consumption proxy because
the consumption floor is not binding for the baseline estimates for this approach. Lowering the
consumption floor does not measurably affect our estimates of C or N, and the ratio of γ(1)/C
rises as a result.36 In all approaches, higher risk aversion raises our estimates of γ(1) and γ(1)/C,
and lower risk aversion decreases it (as expected).
Alternative measure of out-of-pocket spending for those on Medicaid (x(1, m)). In our baseline analysis, we assume that, consistent with Medicaid rules, the insured have no out-of-pocket
spending (x(1, m) = 0). In practice, however, the insured in our data report nontrivial out-of-pocket
spending (Finkelstein et al. (2012)[11]).37
When at least some Medicaid recipients have strictly positive out-of-pocket spending, the expression for the relaxation of the budget constraint at q = 1 becomes:
−

∂x
= p(0)m(1; θ ) − p(1)m(1; θ ).
∂ q |q=1

35 A long line of simulation literature uses a value of 3 for the coefficient of relative risk aversion (see, e.g., Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes (1995)[14], Mitchell, Poterba, Warshawsky, and Brown (1999)[18], Scholz, Seshadri, and
Khitatrakun (2006) [21], Brown and Finkelstein(2008)[8], and Einav et al. (2010)[9]. Naturally, though, there are
a range of plausible estimates; a substantial consumption literature, summarized in Laibson, Repetto, and Tobacman
(1998)[16], has found risk aversion levels closer to 1, while other papers report higher levels of relative risk aversion
(Barsky, Kimball, Juster, and Shapiro (1997)[6], Palumbo (1999)[19]).
36 The results are opposite for an increase in the consumption floor, though now the consumption-based optimization
approach using the CEX is affected (because the higher floor starts to bind for some CEX observations) and we now
observe slight changes in C and N because the higher consumption floor is implemented by lowering the cap on
out-of-pocket spending.
37 This does not appear to be an artifact of our data or setting; in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, Medicaid
recipients also self-report substantial out-of-pocket spending (Gross and Notowidigdo (2011)[13]).

The second term, p(1)m(1; θ ), is the distribution of out-of-pocket spending of the insured,
which is given by the distribution of out-of-pocket spending by treatment compliers. The first
term, p(0)m(1; θ ), is the distribution of out-of-pocket spending that the uninsured would have
had if they had incurred the medical spending of the insured. We rewrite the expression for the
relaxation of the budget constraint at q = 1 as:
−

∂x
= (p(0)m(0; θ ) − p(1)m(1; θ )) + p(0) (m(1; θ ) − m(0; θ )) .
∂ q |q=1

We evaluate this expression by taking the difference in the distributions of out-of-pocket expenditures of control compliers (p(0)m(0; θ )) and treatment compliers (p(1)m(1; θ )) and add to
this the price faced by the uninsured times the difference in the distributions of medical spending of
treatment compliers minus medical spending of control compliers (p(0) (m(1; θ ) − m(0; θ ))). The
price faced by the uninsured is calculated as the ratio of mean out-of-pocket spending to mean total
spending for the control compliers. In the construction of differences in distributions, we assume
quantile stability. In other words, we take the difference in distributions assuming an individual
with a given θ that puts him at quantile r in the control complier distribution would have been at
quantile r in the treatment complier distribution if he had been in the treatment group. In column
VI, we present estimates from this alternative approach, in which we re-estimate all of our fitted
consumption and out-of-pocket spending distributions based on self-reported out-of-pocket spending for treatment compliers as well as control compliers. In addition, we now have to estimate the
“pure-insurance” term in equation (13) at q = 1, since we no longer assume full insurance at q = 1
as in the baseline analysis; our estimate of this term is not exact due to a technical complication
relating to re-optimization in response to income effects.38
Allowing for x(1, m) > 0 necessarily reduces our estimates of γ(1) but it also reduces our
estimates of C (and hence N), so that the net effect on γ(1)/C is a priori ambiguous. In practice,
column VI shows that it substantially lowers our estimates of the willingness to pay for Medicaid
relative to net costs.
Alternative assumption about within-family smoothing. Our baseline consumption proxy approach assumed that out-of-pocket medical spending reduced consumption of each family member
by the same amount. Substantial within-family risk smoothing seems likely, given how much of
consumption is joint (e.g., housing). But the extreme of full smoothing within the family (i.e.,
38 Specifically, under the conceptual thought experiment in which individuals “pay” γ(1) units of consumption, they
will re-optimize over m and c if m has a nonzero income elasticity. In Appendix A.1, we showed that failure to take
this income effect into account corresponds to omitting a term from the definition of dγ(q)
dq that captures the individual’s
willingness to pay to re-optimize; this additional term is zero by construction at q = 0, and is also zero at q = 1 under
our baseline assumption that x(1, m) = 0.

the effect on an individual’s consumption is the same regardless of whether the individual or a
family member incurred the out-of-pocket medical spending) may not be warranted. In column
VII, therefore, we examine the sensitivity of our results to the alternative extreme assumption: that
the out-of-pocket spending affects consumption only for the individual who incurred the expenses.
This substantially raises our estimates of the willingness to pay for Medicaid relative to net costs
under the two approaches that use the consumption proxy: the complete-information approach and
the consumption-based optimization approach using the consumption proxy.
Alternative interpolations in the optimization approach. In the baseline optimization approaches, we assumed dγ/dq was linear in q to interpolate between q = 0 and q = 1 (see Assumption 4). Here, we explore the sensitivity of our results to two alternative interpolations. We
cannot implement these alternatives for the approach that relies on the CEX consumption measure
because they require we observe medical spending both for treatment and control compliers, which
is only the case for our Oregon data.
The first alternative interpolation assumes that the demand for medical care is linear in price
(rather than that dγ/dq is linear in q). Given our definition of p(q) ≡ qp(1) + (1 − q)p(0), the
assumption that the demand for medical care, m, is linear in price implies that the demand is also
linear in q. Because the empirical distribution of medical care is measured imprecisely, we infer
the distribution of m(0; θ ) by the distribution of out-of-pocket expenditure divided by the price
that uninsured individuals pay for medical care, x(0; θ )/p(0), where x(0; θ ) denotes the empirical
distribution of out-of-pocket spending among the uninsured. We infer the distribution of medical
care for the insured from the distribution of medical care for the uninsured by assuming that each
point in the distribution scales up proportionally to the overall increase in medical care due to
Medicaid coverage, E[m(1; θ )]/E[m(0; θ )]. Thus, the distribution of medical care for the insured
)]
is given by: E[m(1;θ
E[m(0;θ )] x(0; θ )/p(0). Using the assumption that the demand for medical care is linear
in q, we have:
m(q; θ ) = q

E(m(1; θ ))
x(0; θ )/p(0) + (1 − q)x(0; θ )/p(0).
E(m(0; θ ))

(38)

The distribution of out-of-pocket spending for each value of q is given by:
x(q, m(q; θ )) = p(q)m(q; θ ) = (1 − q)p(0)m(q; θ ),
where the latter equality follows from the fact that Medicaid recipients face a zero price of medical
care, i.e., p(1) = 0. Substituting the expression for m(q; θ ) into this equation yields the expression

We use equation (24) to infer the distribution of consumption from the distribution of outof-pocket spending. From the distribution of consumption, we calculate the distribution of the
marginal utility of consumption using uc = (c (q; θ ) − γ(q))−σ . We calculate the distribution of
the marginal relaxation of the budget constraint, −∂ x/∂ q = (p(1) − p(0))m(q; θ ), for each value
of q by substituting in the expression for the demand of medical care (equation (38)) and noting
that p(1) = 0. This yields:

and solve this differential equation using Picard’s method (using 1000 iterations) to obtain γ(1).
Column VIII in Appendix Table 4 presents the results. We find that the interpolation based on a
linear demand for m yields moderately lower estimates for γ(1) ($1283 instead of $1421) and for
γ(1)/C (0.89 instead of 0.98).
The second alternative interpolation allows any functional form for the demand for medical
care (rather than assuming it is linear in price) and finds the functional form that maximizes γ(1).
We allow for arbitrary (nonparametric) functional forms for the demand for medical care with the
restriction that demand at values of q ∈ (0, 1) must lie somewhere between demand at q = 0 and at
q = 1. Specifically, we define the distribution of medical care at insurance level q to be some linear
combination of the distribution of medical care at q = 0 and at q = 1, where these distributions are
given by equation (38). Formally, the distribution of medical care at insurance level q is given by
m̂(λ (q); θ ) = λ m(0; θ ) + (1 − λ )m(1; θ ) for some λ (q) ∈ [0, 1].
The distribution of out-of-pocket spending for each value of q and λ is given by
p(q)m̂(λ (q); θ ) = (1 − q)p(0)m̂(λ (q); θ ). We use equation (24) to infer the distribution of consumption from the distribution of out-of-pocket spending; we denote the resulting consumption
level by ĉ(λ (q); θ ). From the distribution of consumption, we calculate the distribution of the
marginal utility of consumption using uc = (ĉ (λ (q); θ ) − γ(q))−σ . We calculate the distribution

We solve this differential equation using Picard’s method to find the upper bound for γ(1). Column IX in Appendix Table 4 shows that the upper bound for γ(1) is $3065 and the upper bound
for γ (1) /C is 2.12. This latter estimate suggests that it is possible for the value of Medicaid to
significantly exceed its net resource cost under alternative assumptions about the shape of demand
and the utility function.

B.2

Alternative health values and measures

Appendix Table 5 explores the robustness of the estimates of γ(1) and γ(1)/C to different health
measures and different assumptions on the valuation of health. Column I replicates our baseline estimates. Naturally, assumptions regarding health valuation matter only for the completeinformation approach; one attraction of the consumption-based optimization approach is that it
does not require us to estimate and value health improvements.
The marginal rate of substitution of health for consumption (φ ). In column II, we assume
the MRS of health for consumption is 0. This is motivated by the fact that while many measures
of self-reported health improved, we are unable to reject the null of no impact of Medicaid on
mortality (Finkelstein et al. (2012)[11]) or on our specific measures of physical health (Baicker et
al. (2013)[5]). Therefore, an alternative of “no health benefits” seems a not unreasonable bound.
Since the health component of the value of Medicaid was fairly small relative to the consumption
component in the complete-information approach, this has a relatively small effect on the estimates.
Our baseline implementation assumed a MRS of health for consumption (φ ) of $5, 000 for our
low-income population. This came from scaling the “consensus” estimate of a VSLY of $100, 000
for the general population by the ratio of the marginal utility of consumption for our population
and the general population. In column III, we instead assume that the MRS scales linearly with
consumption; we therefore use a MRS of health for consumption of $40,000 rather than $5,000.
As a result, the estimate for γ(1) almost doubles while γ(1)/C rises from 1.2 to 2.1. These are
substantial changes that underscore the importance of the calibrated value of the MRS of health
for consumption in a low-income population. While assuming that the MRS scales linearly with
consumption is ad hoc and conceptually inconsistent with our assumption of σ = 3, it is closer than

our baseline assumption to the findings of Kniessner et al. (2010)[15], who estimate an income
elasticity of about 1.4 for this parameter.
As an alternative to using an external estimate of the MRS of health for consumption, we can
also estimate the MRS of health for consumption from the first-order condition for m in equation
(17). In other words, given our estimates of the return to medical spending (d h̃/dm) and the price
p, we can estimate what uh /uc must be for the first-order condition to hold for the observed choices
of m. Given that we express h in QALYs, the ratio uh /uc is the MRS of health for consumption.
We find that a MRS of health for consumption of $6,343 causes the first-order condition to hold on
average for compliers. We note two caveats to this internal estimate. First, this estimate requires
us to estimate d h̃/dm for the entire sample by IV (using the lottery indicator as an instrument).
While the first-stage of this IV regression is statistically significant, a t-statistic of 2.1 nevertheless
indicates a weak first stage implying that the resulting IV estimate may not be reliable. Second,
the internal estimate for the MRS is biased upward due to corner solutions because those who
choose m = 0 place a lower value on a statistical life year than is implied by our estimate of uh /uc .
Nevertheless, we found the finding that the internally-derived estimate of the MRS of health for
consumption is of the same order of magnitude as our baseline assumption from external sources
($5000) to be broadly reassuring.
Alternative health measures. In the remaining columns, we return to our baseline MRS of
health for consumption (φ ) of $5, 000 and explore robustness to alternative health measures. Our
baseline measure was the five-point self-assessed health question. In prior work on the Oregon
Health Insurance Experiment, Medicaid coverage was estimated to improve this measure of selfreported health, in addition to two other measures: the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) depression screen, and the Short Form health questionnaire’s (SF-8) measures of recent physical and
mental health problems (Finkelstein et al. (2012)[11]; Baicker et al. (2013)[5]).
In column IV, we examine the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) measure, which
is commonly used as a depression screen. The PHQ-2 asks respondents about the prevalence in
the last two weeks of having been “bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things” and
of having been “bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.” We rely on the estimates
from Pyne et al. (2009)[20], which are based on the “Standard Gamble” approach, to convert the
PHQ-2 responses to QALYs; Appendix A.4 provided details of this conversion. We estimate that
Medicaid increases health by 0.027 QALYs based on the PHQ-2 health measure, as compared to
0.045 QALYs under our baseline self-reported health measure. The estimates for the PHQ-2 health
measure are correspondingly lower, which is not surprising given that the complete-information
approach requires a comprehensive health measure whereas PHQ-2 only measures mental health.
We also draw on a separate data source - based on a series of in-person interviews conducted
71

in the Portland metro area about two years after the lottery - that has additional health measures
not available in our baseline data: the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) and the “Short
Form” health survey (SF-8).39 Columns V through VIII show the results. In column V, we replicate
our baseline self-assessed health measure for the subsample of the in-person data that answered
that question as well as all questions of the PHQ-8. Columns V and I show how results compare
when we use the same self-assessed health measure in the mail-in survey and the in-person survey
(which is limited to the Portland area). In the in-person data, we can measure health using the same
PHQ-2 measure used in the mail survey (column VI) and the richer PHQ-8 measure (column VII).
Estimates using the PHQ-8 measure are quite similar to those using the PHQ-2 measure (compare
columns VI and VII).
We also use data from the in-person interviews to see how our estimates change if we use
the SF-8. The SF-8 is a general health survey that captures both physical and mental health.
We convert the SF-8 to QALYs using the mapping from Sullivan and Ghushchyan (2006)[23].
Unlike the previous mappings to QALYs we used, which were all based on the “Standard Gamble”
method, this last mapping uses the other principal method in the literature: the “Time-Trade-Off”
method; Appendix A.4 provided more detail on this method. Column VIII shows that results using
the SF-8 measure are similar to results with the PHQ measures.

Notes: This table compares summary statistics among the uninsured that we analyze in two different data sets: the
Oregon sample and the CEX. The statistics for the Oregon sample are for control compliers and are estimated using the
IV techniques described in Appendix A.2.1. In the Oregon sample, we report, for mean non-medical consumption, the
results from the consumption proxy approach (see equation (24)). The CEX sample is limited to single adults aged 19-64
without health insurance and living below the federal poverty line. Further details of the sample construction are in
Appendix A.5.1. The sample size for the CEX in this table is smaller than the sample size for the CEX in Appendix Table
2 because the latter sample also includes individuals with health insurance. Mean consumption in the Oregon sample is
based on CEX data; it is mean per capita non-medical consumption in families living below the federal poverty line and
headed by an uninsured adult. Other details for the sample used to calculate mean consumption for the Oregon sample
are identical to those described in Appendix A.5.1.

Notes: This table presents our baseline estimates for the pure-insurance term in the consumption-based optimization approach that uses the consumption measure from the Consumer Expenditure Survey.
The sample consists of single adults aged 19-64 below 100% of the federal poverty line (N=1,065). The numbers reported in the table are the covariances of marginal utility of non-health consumption
(using a coefficient of relative risk aversion of 3) and out-of-pocket medical spending, normalized by the mean value of the marginal utility of consumption for the relevant population; see equation (13).
The consumption measure in the first column consists of all non-health expenditure in the CEX (excluding contributions to private and public pension programs), where we define health expenditure as
individual expenditures for health care providers, prescription drugs, and medical devices. The consumption measure in column II is the same as that in column I but excludes expenditures on durables:
vehicle purchases, major household appliances, house furnishings and equipment, and entertainment equipment (including TVs and radios). The consumption measure in column III consists of non-health
expenditures in categories that can be relatively easily adjusted: food, entertainment, apparel, tobacco, alcohol, personal care, and reading.

Notes: This table compares our baseline estimates of the impact of Medicaid with the baseline estimates of Finkelstein et al. (2012), which we refer
to as "QJE." Self-reported health is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the individual reports being in good, very good, or excellent health. Column I
replicates the QJE results. In column II, we use the same regressions as in column I but restrict the QJE sample to respondents living in households
that have at most 2 lottery tickets and that have non-missing data on all the required variables (see Appendix A.2.1 for more details). In column III,
we use the same sample as in column II but apply the regression approach of this paper (see Appendix A.2.1 for more details). In column IV, we
use the estimation method and sample from this paper, applied to the "adjusted data" for out-of-pocket spending. "Adjusted data" refers to the outof-pocket spending data after (i) estimating it by fitting a lognormal distribution with a mass point at zero for the distribution of out-of-pocket
spending, (ii) adjusting the out-of-pocket spending of the insured to be 0, and (iii) imposing a ceiling on out-of-pocket spending for the uninsured
such that consumption does not fall below the consumption floor (see Appendix A.2.2 for more details). All dollar amounts are per Medicaid
recipient per year.

Notes: This table presents the sensitivity of our baseline results to alternative assumptions unrelated to health valuations. Alternative assumptions about health specifications are reported in Appendix Table 5. Because the WTP estimates
from the complete-information approach cannot be exactly decomposed into a transfer component and a pure-insurance component (only relatively wide ranges for these components can be provided), the table does not report a
decomposition of the complete-information approach. Column I reports the baseline specification. We report the estimates under alternative assumptions about risk aversion (columns II-III) and the consumption floor (columns IV-V).
We also consider specifications that allow for out-of-pocket spending to be positive for the insured (column VI) and assume that the health expenditure shock is borne solely by the individual instead of being shared equally within
families (column VII). Columns VIII and IX report alternative interpolation assumptions, including linear demand (column VIII) and the upper bound procedure described in the text (column IX).

Notes: Because the WTP estimates from the complete-information approach cannot be exactly decomposed into a transfer component and a pure-insurance component (only relatively wide ranges
for these components can be provided), the table does not report this decomposition. Consequently, the table does not report an estimate of the moral hazard cost, which depends on this
decomposition. Column I reports our baseline estimates, while other columns report alternatives as indicated in the column headings. The MRS of Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) for
consumption (φ) is the amount of consumption a low-income person is willing to forgo on the margin for a QALY. The health measure is the measure on which the QALY score is based. SAH
denotes the "Self-Assessed Health" measure; PHQ denotes the "Patient Health Questionnaire" score, which measures mental health. PHQ-2 denotes a score based on two items from the PHQ where
as PHQ-8 denotes a score based on 8 items of the PHQ. SF-8 denotes the 8-item "Short Form" health measure, which measures both physical and mental health. Additional information on these
health measures and their mapping to QALYs is provided in Appendix A.4. In our baseline specification, we estimate that Medicaid increases QALYs by 0.045 (see Table 2). For QALYs
measured by different health measures or in different samples, the estimated impact of Medicaid on QALYs becomes 0.027 in column IV, 0.049 in column V, 0.032 in column VI, 0.027 in column
VII, and 0.027 in column VIII.

Notes: This table presents summary statistics for the PSID sample used to estimate the relationship between out-of-pocket
medical spending and consumption in Appendix Table 7. The sample consists of household heads aged 25-64 with nonmissing reports for hospitalization and consumption data. We restrict the sample to households with per capita household
income below $20,000. Consumption is per capita, expressed in dollars per year, and based on the consumption categories
collected in the PSID, which are not comprehensive. The hospitalization rate is the fraction of individuals that were
hospitalized in the past 12 months.

Notes: This table presents the calculation of the pure-insurance term for the consumption-based optimization approach using data from the PSID.
Column I presents the calculation based on an OLS regression of log(c -3) on log(x ). Column II presents the results from an IV strategy that uses
hospitalization of the household head as an instrument for log out-of-pocket medical spending. Both regressions include a cubic in age, a quadratic
function in household size, and year dummies as controls. Standard errors for the covariance term reflect sampling uncertainty in β but treat E[x ] and
Std(x ) as non-stochastic. Standard errors are clustered by the individual household head.
