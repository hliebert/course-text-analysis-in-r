Understanding the Mechanisms
Through Which an Influential Early Childhood Program
Boosted Adult Outcomest
By James Heckman, Rodrigo Pinto, and Peter Savelyev*
A growing literature establishes that high quality early childhood

interventions targeted toward disadvantaged children have

substantial impacts on later life outcomes. Little is known about the
mechanisms producing these impacts. This paper uses longitudinal

data on cognitive and personality skills from an experimental
evaluation of the influential Perry Preschool program to analyze
the channels through which the program boosted both male and
female participant outcomes. Experimentally induced changes in
personality skills explain a sizable portion of adult treatment effects.
{JEL 121, 124, 128, J13, J24)

A growing literature establishes that early childhood environments substantially
impact later life outcomes (e.g., Knudsen et al. 2006, Heckman 2008, and Almond
and Currie 2011). Less is known about the channels through which early environments operate to produce their long-term effects. This paper examines the sources of
the success of the Perry Preschool program, a flagship early childhood intervention
in the United States.1

The Perry program was a randomized trial that targeted disadvantaged, low IQ
African American children ages three to four. After two years, all participants left

Our analysis shows the benefits and limitations of social experiments. The
Perry study generated experimentally determined treatment effects for outcomes

and skills. However, knowledge that the program enhanced skills and improved a
number of outcomes is not enough to establish that the improvement in measured
skills caused the improvement in outcomes. Without further assumptions, data
from the experiment do not determine the production function relating changes in
skills to changes in adult outcomes. The program may also improve unmeasured

skills. Changes in measured skills may simply proxy changes in unmeasured
skills that affect outcomes. To address this issue, we supplement the treatment
effects obtained from the experiment with an econometric model that estimates

the relationship between outcomes and experimentally induce
sured skills. Our method accounts for measurement error and treatment-induced

changes in unmeasured skills. Access to experimental data allows us to test some
of its identifying assumptions. Evidence from a series of specification tests supports our econometric procedure.
The paper proceeds in the following way. Section I describes the Perry program
and the experiment that evaluated it. Section II presents our econometric model.
Section III discusses the variety of measures of psychological skills at our disposal
and the need to create low-dimensional summaries of them. It explains how we
construct summary measures and test for the validity of the constructed summaries. Section IV presents our analysis of the sources of the Perry treatment effects.
Section V concludes. An online Appendix presents supplementary material.
I. The Perry Program: Design and Background
The Perry program targeted African American children with low IQs and socioeconomic status (Schweinhart and Weikart 1981). The experiment was conducted
during the mid-1960s in the district of the Perry elementary school in Ypsilanti,

Michigan. Children began the program at age three and were enrolled for two
years.14 Parents were disadvantaged as measured by their income and education.
Roughly 47 percent of the children in the study did not have fathers present in the
household at age three.
The 123 participants were randomized into treatment and control groups.15 The
Perry sample consists of 51 females (25 treatment and 26 control) and 72 males
(33 treatment and 39 control). There was relatively little attrition: only 11 participants left the study by the time of the interview at age 40. 16

The Perry curriculum is based on the principle of active participatory learning, in

which children and adults are treated as equal partners in the learning process, and
children engage with objects, people, events, and ideas.17 Abilities to plan, execute,
and evaluate tasks were fostered, as were social skills, including cooperation with
others and resolution of interpersonal conflicts. The Perry curriculum has been inter-

preted as implementing the theories of Vygotsky (1986) in teaching self-control and
sociability.18 A widely implemented program based on these principles - Tools of
the Mind - is designed to promote self-control.19

Sessions lasted 2.5 hours and were held five days a week during the school
year. Teachers in the program, all of whom had bachelor's degrees (or higher) in

14 The first entry cohort was enrolled for only one year of the program, beginning at age four.

15Heckman et al. (2010a) describe the protocol and develop statistical procedures for testing treatment effects
which take into account the peculiarities of the Perry randomization protocol.
6Five control and two treatment group participants died; two control and two treatment group participants were
missing.
17 See online Appendix A for more information on the Perry curriculum.
18 The curriculum of the Perry program was also grounded, in part, in the research on cognitive development
by Jean Piaget (Piaget and Inhelder 2000) and in the progressive educational philosophy of John Dewey (Dewey

1997).

See Tough (2009) for a popular exposition of the Tools of the Mind program. See Bodrova and Leong (2007)
for a complete description of the Tools of the Mind program. Diamond et al. (2007) present a recent evaluation
of the program that demonstrates that it enhanced self-control by participants. For a discussion of the Vygotskian
foundations of the Perry program see Sylva (1997).

respectively. We use the subscript d G {0, 1} to represent variables when treatment
is fixed at d. Fixing corresponds to manipulating treatment status d holding everything else constant.25 The observed outcome is

The assumption that the parameters ujmj, ipjmj, Var (nJmj) : m1 G Mj,j G Jp, do
not depend on d simplifies the notation, as well as the interpretation of the estimates obtained from our procedure. It implies that the effect of treatment on the
measured skills operates only through the latent skills and not through changing
the measurement system for those skills. This assumption can be tested by estimating measurement systems separately for treatment and control groups and testing if
measurement equation factor loadings and measurement equation intercepts differ
between treatment and control groups.33 We do not reject the hypotheses of equality
of these parameters across treatment and control groups.34
C. Identification

Identification of factor models requires normalizations that set the location and
scale of the factors (e.g., Anderson and Rubin 1956).35 We set the location of each
factor by fixing the intercepts of one measure - designated "the first" - to zero, i.e.,
v' - 0, j G Jp. This defines the location of factor j for each counterfactual condition. We set the scale of the factor by fixing the factor loadings of the first measure

of each skill to one, i.e., <p' = l,j € <JP- For all measures that are related to a factor
(i.e., have a non-zero loading on the factor, tpJmj), the decomposition of treatment
effects presented in this paper is invariant to the choice of which measure is designated as the "first measure" for each factor and to any affine transformations of the

measures.36

Identification is established in four steps. First, we identify the means of the
factors, fiJd. Second, we identify the measurement factor loadings <pjmj, the variances Vai(r]jmj) of the measurement system, and the factor covariance structure Ee¿.

33 See online Appendix E.2 and the discussion in Section IIC.
34 See online Appendix Tables L.2-L.4.
We refer the reader to online Appendix E for a more detailed discussion of identification.
36See online Appendix E.3 for a proof. If oiļ / Oj, we acquire another term in the decomposition that is not
invariant to affine transformations of the measures used to extract factors. However, even in this case, the treatment

effect arising from measured skills in (7) is invariant. See also Heckman and Pinto (forthcoming) for a more general
analysis of the combinations of parameters identified under monotonie transformations of the measures.

D. Estimation Procedure

We estimate the model using a simple three stage procedure. First, we estimate the
measurement system. Second, from these equations we can estimate the skills for
each participant. Third, we estimate the relationship between participant skills and
lifetime outcomes. Proceeding in this fashion makes identification and estimation
transparent. In Section IV and online Appendix L we show that a one-step procedure
produces estimates very similar to those obtained from the three-step procedure. We
estimate the model separately for males and females in light of the evidence that
there are strong gender differences in program effects.41

We compute p- values using the bootstrap. We draw K = 1,000 bootstrap samples
of the original data and apply the estimation procedure to each pseudo-sample the
same way we apply it to the original data. For a one-tailed test with an upper tail
rejection region, the bootstrap p- value is estimated by

III. Measures of Cognitive and Personality Skills

This section explains how we condense the data on psychological skills. Using
standard psychometric methods, we establish that only three factors are required to
explain the available psychological measures. The extracted factors have clear interpretations. After extracting the factors, we test the validity of the derived system.

A. Our Measure of Cognition
A large literature establishes the importance of cognition, as measured by IQ, in
explaining a variety of life outcomes (see, e.g., Gottfredson 1997, and Jensen 1998,
for surveys). We use the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test (Terman and Merrill 1960)
as our measure of cognition. Mean differences in Stanford-Binet scores between
treatment and control groups are plotted by age and gender in panels A (for males)
and B (for females) of Figure 1. A boost in the IQs of children in the treatment
group is observed soon after the program starts at age three. A few years after the
program ends, the effect of treatment on IQ essentially disappears for males. A
small, borderline statistically significant, positive effect remains for females. In our
analysis, we use IQs at ages seven, eight, and nine, since this is the period when the

An intuitively appealing way to construct summary measure
groupings used by the Perry psychologists and to select measur
scales based on common sense and previous research in psycho
interpretability in terms of the Big Five. This procedure is ca
tion" in psychology, and is inherently subjective.49 There are
such indices, which leads to a complex model selection problem
The approach used in this paper is to apply exploratory fa

to the available measures. EFA is a standard statistical met
psychometrics to allocate measures to factors (e.g., Gorsuc

2004). It is used to form the Big Five (see Goldberg 199

links between a small number of latent factors and the available measures. Each

measure is allowed to depend on at most one factor, and the derived factors are
allowed to be freely correlated.
Our application of EFA produces three interpretable factors which we interpret
as cognition, externalizing behavior, and academic motivation.50 The derived factors are consistent with previous research in psychology on the predictive power of
psychological skills. We implement EFA in two stages. We first select the number
of factors. We then allocate the measures of personality skills to different factors.
D. Exploratory Factor Analysis

We use several accepted procedures to determine the number of factors: the
scree test (Cattell 1966), Onatski's test (2009), and Horn's (1965) parallel analysis test.51 Overall, these procedures point to a three-factor characterization for
both men and women.52

Exploratory Factor Analysis: Establishing Dedicated Measures. - We extract
factors following the criteria for EFA laid out by Gorsuch (1983). 53 This method
is widely used although its application requires judgment on the part of the analyst (see Gorsuch 2003; and Thompson 2004). EFA identifies blocks of measures

that are strongly correlated within each block (i.e., satisfy convergent validity), but are weakly correlated between blocks (i.e., satisfy discriminant validity). It discards measures that load on multiple factors. Application of standard
EFA methodology to the 46 cognitive and personality Perry measures gives the
13 measures displayed in Table H.2 in the online Appendix.54
49 See Borghans et al. (2008) and Almlund et al. (201 1).
50 The interpretation of a factor is derived from the interpretation of the measures from which it is extracted.

5 1 Online Appendix H provides additional details about the criteria used in the literature to choose the number
of factors. The Guttman-Kaiser rule (Guttman 1954; and Kaiser 1960, 1961) suggests 7-9 factors. This rule is well
known to overestimate the number of factors (see Zwick and Velicer 1986; Gorsuch 2003, and Thompson 2004) and
this makes it less informative than the other methods. We do not use it in this paper.
52 See Table H.l in the online Appendix.
53 See online Appendix H. 1 for the algebra of factor rotation and for the definition of various factor selection
criteria. We use direct quartimin oblique rotation. We find that other widely recognized oblique rotation methods
such as geomin, lead to similar results and the same choice of measures as quartimin (see Table L.7 of the online
Appendix, which shows the same pattern as the direct quartimin solution in Table H.2 of online Appendix H). This
result is in line with the literature showing that widely recognized methods of oblique rotation produce similar
results (Fabrigar et al. 1999).
54 Measures are retained if they are strongly related to one and only one factor. For statements about the standard

EFA methodology, see Tabachnick and Fidell (2001), Thompson (2004), and Costello and Osborne (2005).

alpha (see Cronbach 1951) is a statistic that captures how well a set of measures proxies a latent skill. Cronbac
alpha is the lower bound of the internal consistency reliability of measures that are proxies for a skill. The in
consistency reliability is defined as the square of the correlation between the measured scale defined as the sum
the measures and the underlying skill 0 (Allen and Yen 2002). In our case, the correlations between the skills
the scales (equal to the square roots of alphas) range from 0.70 to 0.82 for males and from 0.80 to 0.84 for fem
The Cronbach's alphas can also be interpreted as a correlation between the observed scale and a hypothetical a
native scale measuring the same skill and based on the same number of hypothetical alternative items (Nunna
and Bernstein 1994). For this table, the alphas (i.e., the correlations) range from 0.84 to 0.91 for males and fr

0.90 to 0.92 for females.

We follow Gorsuch (2003) and Thompson (2004), and derive a fully dedicated
system as described by equations (8)-(10), i.e., a system in which each measure
is associated with at most one factor. This procedure is called confirmatory fac-

tor analysis (CFA), which Gorsuch (2003) and Thompson (2004) advocate as the
next step after conducting EFA. It produces the interpretable system displayed in
Table 2, based on three factors: cognition, externalizing behavior, and academic
motivation.55 Externalizing behavior is proxied by measures of behavior related
to lying, stealing, and swearing, as well as being aggressive and disruptive. It has
been linked to crime and aggressive behavior.56 Academic motivation is proxied by
measures of student interest, persistence, and initiative in learning and is linked to
performance in schools as measured by achievement tests. The personality measures
proxying externalizing behavior and academic motivation are conceptually related
to Big Five factors in personality psychology.57

IV. The Effect of Treatment on Skills and the Sources of Treatment Effects

We first study how treatment affects the extracted factors. We then investigate
how the factors affect life outcomes. Finally, we decompose adult treatment effects
into components corresponding to changes in each factor. The first analysis is based
on the output of step two of the three-step estimation procedure described in detail
in the Appendix. The second and third analyses are based on the output of the third
step of the procedure.
A. The Effect of the Perry Program on Cognitive and Personality Skills

Figure 5 graphs kernel densities of factor scores and presents one-sided p- values
for testing the equality of the means for each skill between the treatment and control groups.61 The Perry program has a statistically significant treatment effect on
externalizing behavior at the 5 percent level for males and at the 1 percent level
for females. The effects on cognition and academic motivation are statistically significant at the 10 percent and 5 percent levels, respectively, for females, but are
not statistically significant for males. This evidence is consistent with the evidence
in Table 1 of a statistically significant treatment effect on achievement test scores,
which is much stronger for girls than for boys.

"Cognition is uncoirelated with externalizing behavior, while academic motivation correlates with both externalizing behavior and cognition (see Table L.9 of online Appendix L).

percentiles (see panel F). There is no statistically significant difference in the dist

described by a system of equations (5) and (8) conditioning on background vari-

that all three factors (cognition, externalizing behavior, and academic motivation)

Different factors affect different outcomes. Cognition primarily affects achievement tests and also affects certain labor market outcomes. Externalizing behavior
affects crime, labor market outcomes, and health behaviors. Academic motivation
boosts educational outcomes and reduces long-term unemployment.
Treatment effects are generated through changes in skills if (i) skills affect outcomes and (ii) skills are enhanced by the intervention. Thus, even though cognition and academic motivation are positively related to the CAT scores of males,
the absence of a relationship for males between treatment and both cognition and
academic motivation makes this channel either weak or nonexistent.

C. Decomposing Treatment Effects on Outcomes by Source
Figures 6 and 7 present our estimated decompositions of treatment effects into
experimentally induced improvements in cognition, externalizing behavior, academic motivation, and other factors. By "other factors" we mean the residual treatment effect associated with unmeasured skills. We report the percentage of each
treatment effect attributable to each component.63 The numbers shown above each
component are one-sided p- values for the test of whether the component is zero. We
stress that these decompositions are invariant to the choice of normalizing measures
and to affine transformations of the measures.64

We decompose the treatment effect for a number of outcomes: performance on

the California Achievement Test (CAT), special education at school and mental
impairment, labor market outcomes such as income and employment, health behaviors such as smoking tobacco or using drugs, marriage duration, and crime outcomes. The crime outcomes are especially important since they are the dominant

component of Perry program's total benefit (e.g., Heckman et al. 2010b). We only
decompose treatment effects that have been shown to be statistically significant at
the 10 percent level or below after adjusting for the effects of multiple-hypothesis
testing on significance levels (Heckman et al. 2010a; Conti et al. 2013). Proceeding
in this fashion leads to somewhat different decompositions for males and females.
The effect of the intervention on life outcomes operates primarily through the pro-

gram's enhancement of externalizing behavior. Components attributable to changes

in this factor are generally statistically significant and, in most cases, explain

63 Figures 6 and 7 are slightly simplified representations of the results presented in Tables L.10 and L.ll of
the online Appendix. To simplify the exposition, for the figures in the main text, contributions opposite in sign to
those of the total treatment effect are set to zero. These contributions are small and statistically insignificant. Thus
the figures in the text are an accurate summary of the essential information in the tables. Appendix L explains the
methodology for constructing the figures and shows (see Figure L.2) that the figures presented in the text closely
approximate the actual decomposition.

is likely several times larger than these reductions in the number of arrests and
registered crimes. Since externalizing behavior is both malleable at early ages (see
Figure 5) and strongly predictive of crime (see Table 3), it should not be surprising
that crime reduction has been found to be a major benefit of the Perry program.
We also decompose the effect of the program on an achievement test (CAT) for
both males and females. For females, enhancements in academic motivation explain
about 30 percent of the treatment effect on CAT scores at age eight. This estimate is
statistically significant at a 10 percent level (p = 0.057). For CAT scores at age 14,
the role of academic motivation is not precisely determined for males or for females

(p = 0.161 and 0.528).
Finally, we decompose a number of education, labor market, and health outcomes. Academic motivation consistently explains a share of treatment effects for
all education-related outcomes, which is not surprising given strong links between

academic motivation and education outcomes presented in Table 3. However, only
some components of these decompositions are precisely determined (e.g., CAT and
the status of being mentally impaired for females).
For labor market outcomes, we find that about 20 percent of the treatment effect
on monthly income at age 27 (p = 0.089) and also about 20 percent of the treatment
effect on the probability of employment at age 40 (p = 0.085) are explained by
early improvements in externalizing behavior. Additionally, externalizing behavior
explains about 40 percent of tobacco use at age 27 (p - 0.046).

D. Decompositions Based on Indices versus De

A simple alternative to our factor procedure fo
effects of experimentally induced changes in m
indices of the measures in place of factor scores
averages over the measures, are commonly used

as given the cluster of measures identified b

Picking the clusters in this fashion avoids the s
groupings are possible, and many tests among
nested. The comparison being made is one betw

measures not correcting for measurement error an

weighting the measures by the estimated factor
ment error.

Figure 8 decomposes a selection of the treatment effects for a variety of outcomes
for each gender using both indices and factor models.68 For each outcome, we show
the results of the two different estimation procedures using a pair of bars. The first

bar in each pair corresponds to the estimates from the procedure used in this paper.
These bars are identical to those presented in Figures 6 and 7. The second bar in

each pair corresponds to the decomposition obtained from estimating equation (7)
using indices.
Comparing the first bar with the second bar reveals that even though results of the

two procedures lead to similar qualitative conclusions about the role of mediating
skills, the estimates of the explained treatment effect components and the associated
p- values are numerically different. As is apparent from equation (7), there are two
possible sources of difference in the decompositions: (i) different factor loadings
aj and (ii) different estimates of the treatment effect on the factors: E(6{ - ßJ0),

j E Jp. The approach using indices only partially corrects for attenuation bias
by reducing measurement error through simple averaging. Our factor approach
explicitly addresses measurement error. Thus the index approach likely generates downward-biased decompositions. Indeed, the shares of the treatment effects
explained by externalizing behavior are generally smaller for the index-based procedure. The p- values from the index-based procedure are somewhat smaller for females
but somewhat larger for males. Most of the comparisons presented in Figure 8 are
consistent with this interpretation.69'70

68 We present a full comparison of indices with factors in online Appendix L for all treatment effects analyzed in
this paper. See Figures L.6 and L.7 to be compared to Figures 6 and 7 respectively.
Upward bias may arise for the following reason. An index uses equal weights for all measures. It may happen that for some particular outcome, measures that are more predictive of that outcome have relatively higher
weights in the index compared to their weights on the true factor scores. Then the index will be more predictive of
that particular outcome than the factor score. If the effect of using an index outweighs the attenuation bias due to
measurement error, it may happen that a decomposition based on an index is biased upwards. There are only two
instances of this occurring in Figure 8 (tobacco use and felony arrests for males).
70 A related issue, somewhat tangential to the main point of this paper, is the decomposition that results from
using achievement test scores in place of IQ test scores in constructing our decomposition. As noted by Borghans
et al. (201 la, b), 30-40 percent of the variation in achievement test scores is attributable to variation in personality
scores. Thus the common practice of assuming that achievement tests proxy intelligence is misleading. When we
use the CAT scores at ages seven to nine in place of IQ scores at those ages, and construct an "achievement" cognition factor, we overstate the importance of "cognition" as a source of treatment effects. See Tables L.12 and L.13,
Figure L.3, and the discussion in online Appendix L.

E. More Efficient Estimates
The three-step estimation procedure used in this paper is simple and intuitive. In
general, it is not statistically efficient given that we do not impose cross-equation
restrictions across the stages of the estimation. In online Appendix L, we compare the
decompositions obtained from our three-step estimation procedure to those obtained
from a one-step maximum likelihood estimation method where the measurement
system and outcome equation are estimated jointly.71 The results from both procedures are in close agreement, although p-values from the maximum likelihood
procedure are generally lower.72

Appendix on the Three-Step Estimation Procedure

Step 1: For a given set of dedicated measurements, and choice of the number
factors, we estimate the factor model using measurement system (8)-(10).

Step 2: We use the measures and factor loadings estimated in the first step to com

pute a vector of factor scores for each participant i. We form unbiased estimates

the true vector of skills 0, = (6j¡; j e Jp) for agent i. The factor measurement equ
tions contain X which we suppress to simplify the expressions. Notationally, we
represent the measurement system for agent i as

75 Our analysis cannot rule out the possibility that the initial enhancement of IQ in the Perry program permanently boosted personality skills (e.g., by giving participants more understanding of their environment and promoting self-confidence and other skills) even though the initial IQ surge faded. To examine this possibility would
require estimating the state space model of Cunha and Heckman (2008) to examine the transient dynamics of the
model. This would be a formidable empirical challenge for a sample the size of the Perry study.
76 Since we analyze one program in one site with one level of program intensity, we are unable to determine the
external validity of our evidence for other sites or intensity levels, nor can we discuss how easy it is to go to scale
with the program. An analysis of these questions for early childhood outcomes is possible using data from ICPSR
(2010) because roughly 30 percent of Head Start centers adopt some version of the Perry curriculum.
77 The method is due to Bartlett (1937) and is based on the restricted minimization of mean squared error, subject

to L'tp = I|jļ.

This is the multivariate version of the standard one- variable attenuation bias formula.

All covariances in A can be computed directly except for the terms that involve 0.

The covariance Cov(0, 0) is estimated in step 1. Using equation (A3), we can compute Cov(Z, 0S) = Cov(Z, 0). Thus, A is identified. Our bias-correction procedure
consists of pre-multiplying the least squares estimators (â, "ļf) by A-1, thus providing consistent estimates of (a, ~y).79 A one step maximum likelihood procedure,
while less intuitive, directly estimates the parameters without constructing the factors and accounts for measurement error. It is justified in large samples under standard regularity conditions. It produces estimates very close to those obtained from
the three-step procedure but with smaller standard errors. See online Appendix L.

78 Online Appendix F discusses other estimators considered in the literature. Note that the assumption that <p is
known can be replaced with the assumption that <p is consistently estimated and we can use an asymptomatic version of the Gauss-Markov theorem replacing "unbiased" with "unbiased in large samples."

79 See Croon (2002) for more details on this bias-correction approach.
