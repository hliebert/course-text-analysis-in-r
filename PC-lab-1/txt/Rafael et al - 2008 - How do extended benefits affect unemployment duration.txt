Abstract
This paper studies a targeted program that extends the maximum duration of unemployment beneﬁts from 30 weeks to
209 weeks in Austria. Sharp discontinuities in treatment assignment at age 50 and at the border between eligible regions
and control regions identify the effect of extended beneﬁts on unemployment duration. Results indicate that the duration
of job search is prolonged by at least 0.09 weeks per additional week of beneﬁts among men, whereas unemployment
duration increases by at least 0.32 weeks per additional week of beneﬁts for women. This ﬁnding is consistent with a lower
early retirement age applying to women.

1. Introduction
Structural unemployment differs tremendously among countries at relatively similar stages of economic
development. For instance, the 20 OECD member countries analyzed by Nickell and Layard (1999) are
characterized by an average unemployment rate over the period 1983–1996 of about 8%; but the standard
deviation in unemployment rates across these countries amounts to more than 4%. The literature on labor
market institutions documents strong differences in policies that appear to contribute to unemployment with
unemployment insurance being one of the most important candidate explanations. In particular, the potential
duration of unemployment beneﬁts (UBs) is strongly correlated with structural unemployment (Nickell and
Layard, 1999). The idea is that extended beneﬁt duration discourages job search and thus leads to prolonged
unemployment duration.
This paper proposes to identify the causal effect of extending beneﬁts on the duration of job search using
information on a unique policy change in Austria. In June 1988, the Austrian government extended the
potential duration of UBs from 30 weeks to 209 weeks for job seekers aged 50 or older when entering

unemployment, living for at least 6 months in certain regions of Austria, who satisfy a previous work
requirement. There are several interesting aspects of this regional extended beneﬁt program (REBP). First, the
REBP provides a unique opportunity to study the effect of a dramatic increase in the potential beneﬁt
duration by almost 3.5 years. The existing literature on the effects of potential beneﬁt duration on
unemployment duration are primarily based on extensions of beneﬁt duration by one or two quarters.2
Second, the program is strictly targeted with respect to age at entry into unemployment and place of
residence—two dimensions that can be readily observed in the available data. The age based identiﬁcation
strategy compares job seekers who are aged 50 years to job seekers who just fail the age requirement. This
strategy is intuitively appealing because both groups of job seekers are basically of the same age. However,
since the program was strictly applied conditional on having completed the 50th year of age, the slightly older
group of job seekers has access to REBP, whereas the slightly younger group of job seekers does not have
access to REBP. Thus assignment to treatment takes place in a so-called ‘‘sharp’’ regression discontinuity
design (Hahn et al., 2001). One potentially important concern with this strategy is that ﬁrms and workers
could try to manipulate age at entry into unemployment. In particular, ﬁrms might be willing to offer to their
employees not to lay them off until they just satisfy the age requirement.3 The paper therefore proposes to
focus on the second threshold, the border between treated and control regions, to identify the effect of REBP
on unemployment duration. This geography based strategy contrasts individuals living close to both sides of
the border between treated and control regions. This contrast is appealing because labor market conditions are
quite similar within a tightly deﬁned geographical area. Moreover, in contrast to age at entry into
unemployment, region of residence cannot be readily manipulated because workers have to move from control
to treated regions well in advance of the eventual layoff.
Third, Austrian social insurance legislation allows for early retirement at age 54 years for unemployed
women but only at age 59 years for unemployed men. This means that REBP can also be used to study the
interactions between unemployment insurance provisions and early retirement rules. Speciﬁcally, by
performing separate analyses for women and men, this paper can discuss the likely impacts of having an
early retirement option after exhausting UBs among women compared to not having this option among men.
This paper contributes to two strands of the literature. The ﬁrst strand is concerned with measuring the
effects of potential beneﬁt duration on unemployment duration. A selective list of contributions includes Card
and Levine (2000), Hunt (1995), Katz and Meyer (1990), Lalive and Zweimüller (2004b), Mofﬁtt (1985),
Mofﬁtt and Nicholson (1982), Winter-Ebmer (1998) and Van Ours and Vodopivec (2006). These contributions
to the literature are primarily based on differences-in-differences approaches.4 The present paper goes beyond
the existing literature in proposing to use the regression discontinuity approach. This design is appealing.
Berger et al. (2005) ﬁnd that the RDD very robustly identiﬁes the effect that would be found in a randomized
experiment. The smaller second strand of the literature discusses interactions between unemployment
insurance and early retirement. Heyma and Van Ours (2006) study how the early retirement option affects job
ﬁnding rates among older workers in the Netherlands. Riphahn (1997) compares the determinants of
transitions into unemployment and disability among older workers in German data. She concludes that
critical variables such as individual health or aggregate unemployment have clearly different effects on the two
forms of exit from employment. Dahl et al. (1999) reach a similar conclusion using Norwegian data.
The main contributions of this paper are the following. First, the paper studies a dramatic change in
potential beneﬁt duration. This is appealing from an economic viewpoint because it provides evidence on the
maximum extent to which changing the potential beneﬁt duration contributes to unemployment. Moreover,
because the treatment dose is so large, a graphical analysis of the treatment effect is quite informative. Second,
2
For instance, Katz and Meyer (1990) use state variation in federal supplementation of potential beneﬁt duration by one quarter
(13 week) triggered by high unemployment. Lalive et al. (2006) study changes in potential beneﬁt duration in Austria by 9 and 22 weeks,
respectively.
3
Such a reaction can invalidate the regression discontinuity assumption that average unemployment duration for individuals just
missing the age threshold is informative on the counterfactual duration without treatment for individuals who have just turned 50 years.
See McCrary (2007) and Lee and McCrary (2005) for a discussion of manipulation in the regression discontinuity design (RDD).

In the static labor supply literature, Lemieux and Milligan (2007) study the incentive effects of social assistance on the decision to work
in a RDD and discuss the relationship between the RDD and the differences-in-differences approach. Moreover, Card et al. (2006) discuss
the likely reasons for the effects of extended beneﬁts on unemployment duration exploiting discontinuities in Austrian severance pay rules.

this paper identiﬁes the effects of the same change in potential beneﬁt duration at two thresholds—the age
threshold and the border threshold. This is useful because the regression discontinuity assumption may
be satisﬁed for the geographic analysis but not necessarily for the age based strategy. Moreover, because the
effect of treatment may depend on the characteristics of individuals, this paper illustrates that the average
effects identiﬁed at two thresholds do not agree because the underlying threshold populations differ. Third,
the analysis uses rich, high quality, comprehensive data from two administrative sources, the Austrian social
security database, and the Austrian unemployment insurance register. These data provide a comprehensive
account of the entire work history of individuals since the year 1972. Moreover, the data record very
accurately both the age at entry into unemployment and the place of residence of job seekers. These two pieces
of information are crucial in implementing a convincing regression discontinuity identiﬁcation strategy.
Fourth, the data cover the universe of all unemployment spells. This allows concentrating on unemployment
spells that are fairly close to the age and border thresholds thus limiting the possible biases due to misspeciﬁcation. Indeed, results indicate that the effects of both age and distance border on average
unemployment duration can be captured in a relatively simple manner—a model with a linear trend on
both sides of the threshold. This means that the empirical analysis convincingly identiﬁes the effect of extended
beneﬁts and early retirement rules on unemployment duration. Fifth, many countries are developing strategies
for their pension systems to be able to cope with rapidly aging populations. This paper argues that it may be
important to focus on pathways to retirement that are generated by social assistance programs outside the
pension system.
The outline of this paper is as follows. Section 2 provides background on the unemployment insurance
system, on the REBP, and on the early retirement rules in Austria. Section 3 discusses the data set and
provides descriptive statistics on the sub-samples of eligible and ineligible job seekers used in the main
analysis. Section 4 provides descriptive evidence on the effects of REBP on unemployment duration, on the
composition of the unemployment inﬂow, and on the size of the unemployment inﬂow. Section 5 discusses
identiﬁcation and estimation of treatment effects in the RDD. Section 6 provides the regression analysis of the
effects of REBP on unemployment duration, and Section 7 concludes this paper with a summary of our
ﬁndings.
2. Background
This section discusses the Austrian unemployment insurance and early retirement rules and it provides
background on the REBP. Moreover, the section discusses why the REBP may affect women differently from
men.
2.1. Unemployment insurance
The design of the Austrian unemployment insurance system is encoded in a national unemployment
insurance law (Arbeitslosenversicherungsgesetz). Before August 1989, an unemployed person could draw
regular UBs for a maximum period of 30 weeks provided that he or she had paid unemployment insurance
contributions for at least 156 weeks within the last 5 years.5 In August 1989 the potential duration of UB
payments became dependent not only on previous experience but also on age at the beginning of the
unemployment spell. Beneﬁt duration for the age group 40–49 was increased to 39 weeks if the unemployed
has been employed 312 weeks within the last 10 years prior to the current spell. For the age group 50 and
older, UB-duration was increased to 52 weeks if the unemployed has been employed for at least 468 weeks
within the last 15 years.
Voluntary quitters and workers discharged for misconduct cannot claim beneﬁts until a waiting period of 4
weeks has passed. UB recipients are expected to search actively for a new job that should be within the scope
of the claimant’s qualiﬁcations, at least during the ﬁrst months of the unemployment spell. Non-compliance
5

UB duration was 20 weeks for job-seekers who did not meet this requirement. This paper focuses on individuals who were entitled to at
least 30 weeks of beneﬁts.

with the eligibility rules is subject to beneﬁt sanctions that can lead to the withdrawal of beneﬁts for up to
4 weeks.
Compared to other European countries, the replacement ratio (UB relative to gross monthly earnings) is
rather low. The amount of UB payments depends on previous earnings and, in 1990, the replacement ratio was
40.4% for the median income earner; 48.2% for a low-wage worker who earned half the median; and 29.6%
for a high-wage worker earning twice the median. On top, family allowances are paid. UB payments are not
taxed implying that net-replacement rates are substantially higher than 40%, and there is no experience rating
of ﬁrms.
After UB payments have been exhausted, job seekers can apply for ‘‘transfer payments for those in need’’
(Notstandshilfe).6 As the name indicates, these social assistance transfers are means tested. Social assistance
payments depend on the income and wealth situation of other family members and close relatives and may, in
principle, last for an indeﬁnite time period. These transfers are granted for successive periods of 39 weeks after
which eligibility requirements are recurrently checked. The social assistance transfers are lower than UB and
can at most be 92% of UB. In 1990, the median post-UB transfer payment was about 70% of the median UB
among job seekers who were eligible for social assistance. Note, however, that individuals who are eligible for
such transfers may not be comparable to individuals who collect UB because not all individuals who exhaust
UB pass the means test. The majority of the unemployed (59%) received UB, whereas 26% received social
assistance transfers.
2.2. The regional extended benefits program
The background of the REBP is strongly tied to the history of the Austrian steel sector. To protect its assets
after World War II from Soviet appropriation and to provide the capital needed for reconstruction, Austria
nationalized its iron, steel, and oil industries, large segments of the heavy engineering and electrical industries,
most of the coal mines, and the non-ferrous metal industries. State owned ﬁrms in manufacturing were part of
a large holding company, the Oesterreichische Industrie AG, OeIAG. By the mid-1970s this holding company
was running into serious problems related to shrinking markets, overstafﬁng, too heavy concentration on
outmoded smokestack industries, insufﬁcient research and development, and low productivity. Initially, the
Austrian government covered the losses by subsidies. But in 1986, after the steel industry was hit by an oil
speculation scandal and failure of an U.S. steel plant project, this protectionist policy was abolished. A new
management was appointed and a strict restructuring plan was implemented. This plan aimed at focusing on
the holdings’ core competencies. The result were layoffs due to plant closures and downsizing, particularly in
the steel industry.
To mitigate the labor market problems in the concerned regions the Austrian government enacted a law that
extended UB-entitlement to 209 weeks for a speciﬁc sub-group. An unemployed worker became eligible to 209
weeks of UB if he or she satisﬁed, at the beginning of his or her unemployment spell, each of the following
criteria: (i) age 50 or older; (ii) a continuous work history (780 employment weeks during the last 25 years
prior to the current unemployment spell); (iii) location of residence in one of the 28 selected labor market
districts since at least 6 months prior to the claim; and (iv) start of a new unemployment spell after June 1988
or spell in progress in June 1988. The REBP was initially expected to be in effect until December 1991.
However, the Austrian parliament decided at the end of 1991 to extend the program until August 1993 when it
was eventually abolished.
The minister for social affairs, a member of the ruling party SPÖ, was in charge of selecting those regions
that became eligible to the program. Records of the meetings in which the set of regions eligible to the program
was decided are not open to the public. However, Lalive and Zweimüller (2004a) show that eligible regions
were characterized by a strong concentration of employment in the steel sector and that there are no
differences between regions in terms of unemployment. These two facts support an explanation that the
program was targeted towards regions with a relatively high share of employment in the steel sector rather
than towards regions with high structural unemployment. Note that except for the REBP, all other labor
market institutions do not differ across regions.
6

This implies that job seekers who do not meet UB eligibility criteria can apply for UA at the beginning of their spell.

This discussion implies, ﬁrst, that it might be difﬁcult to draw reliable evidence on the effect of REBP from a
global comparison of treated and control regions because these regions are characterized by a different
industry structure. However, a local comparison at the border between treated and control regions can be
quite informative if communities located on both sides of the border are similar in terms of industry and age
structure. Second, it is clear that individuals entering unemployment from a job in the steel industry were not
only facing a different unemployment insurance regime but were affected by the restructuring of the steel
sector. Thus it is very difﬁcult to isolate the effects of extended beneﬁts on unemployment duration in the nonsteel inﬂow. This paper therefore proposes to focus on the non-steel inﬂow. Note that more than 80% of all
job seekers were not previously employed in the steel sector. This means that concentrating on the non-steel
inﬂow allows identifying the effects of extended beneﬁts on an important sub-sample of the entire
unemployment inﬂow.
2.3. Early retirement rules
Austrian social security legislation provides for regular old age pensions at age 65 for men and age 60 for
women. Pension beneﬁts depend on contributions to the pension system in the 156 months (13 years) prior to
leaving the labor force, and on the total number of months contributed to the pension system.
There are two early retirement pathways available at age 60 for men and at age 55 for women. The ﬁrst
is provided for individuals who have a long contribution history, that is, worked for at least 420 months
(35 years) prior to claiming early retirement. Also, individuals applying for this early retirement option must
have worked for at least 2 out of the previous 3 years before entering early retirement. The second early
retirement option is available to individuals who have spent at least 12 out of the previous 15 months claiming
UBs, post-UB transfers, or special income support.
A third measure affecting older workers is Sonderunterstützung (special income support). This measure was
originally created in January 1974 to support individuals in the mining sector who were permanently displaced
just prior to becoming eligible for early retirement. The special income support program provides beneﬁts for
at most 1 year; beneﬁts are 25% higher than UBs capped from above by the pension beneﬁt the individual is
expected to receive from the pension system. In 1979, the system was extended to cover all men aged 59 years
or older and women aged 54 years or older, provided they had contributed to the pension system for at least 15
out of the previous 25 years. Note that the previous contribution requirement for the special income support is
identical to the contribution requirement for REBP.
2.4. Hypotheses
The effects of the REBP for men can be analyzed in the standard job search framework where job seekers
receive UBs as long as they have not exhausted the potential beneﬁt duration. Thereafter job seekers are
eligible for reduced social assistance transfers. Mortensen (1977) argues that extending the potential beneﬁt
duration in such a system tends to reduce the transition rate to regular jobs because it postpones the
exhaustion of regular UBs.7 This reduction in the unemployment exit rate leads to prolonged unemployment
duration.
In contrast to men, women have access to special income support once UBs have been exhausted. This
means that in contrast to the standard job search model, eligible women are facing an upward sloping time
path of beneﬁts discouraging job search strongly.8 Thus, REBP is expected to prolong unemployment
duration much more strongly for women than for men.
Moreover, ﬁrms and workers may even use REBP to change their early retirement strategies. Laying off an
older worker who is unproductive but has been employed with the ﬁrm for a long period damages the
reputation of the ﬁrm. In contrast, offering this worker an early retirement option is a way to end the
employment relationship without damaging one’s reputation among on-going employment relationships.
Thus, providing early retirement is an attractive option for ﬁrms who want to keep a reputation as a long-term
7

Lalive et al. (2006) ﬁnd that this is indeed the case for small beneﬁt extensions.
These predictions have been recently developed in the standard job search model (Hairault et al., 2006).

employer but also desire to end employment relationships that are marginally unproductive. In general,
ﬁnancing early retirement is costly. However, since REBP replaces at least 40% of previous income, this
strategy becomes attractive for ﬁrms who expect signiﬁcant savings from ending an employment relationship
but do not want to be perceived as reneging on a promise of long-term employment. They merely need to
provide severance pay to top off UBs in order to reach the level of a regular old age pension. Analyzing
unemployment duration is informative on the extent to which such agreements may have taken place. Women
with access to an early retirement package are certain not to leave unemployment until they reach age 54
(special income support program starts; income while unemployed is lower than special income support) or
age 55 (regular early retirement program starts; income while unemployed is higher than special income
support). This means that the duration of unemployment among eligible women with an early retirement
option is a monotonically decreasing function of the time from age at entry into unemployment to age
54/55 years.
3. Data
To assess the impact of beneﬁt duration and early retirement rules on the duration of unemployment spells,
I use longitudinal individual data from two different sources: (i) the Austrian social security database (ASSD)
which contains detailed information on the individuals’ age, employment, unemployment and earnings history
since the year 1972, and some information on the employer like region and industry afﬁliation and (ii) the
Austrian unemployment register (AUR) from which I get information on the place of residence (community)
and relevant socio-economic characteristics. The data cover the universe of the unemployment inﬂow over the
period 1986–1995. The corresponding spells are followed up until the end of 1998.
Unemployment duration is measured in weeks registered at the unemployment ofﬁce. There are two
important issues with analyzing unemployment duration. First, changes in beneﬁt duration may affect weeks
of registered unemployment in a purely mechanical way if all individuals are deregistered once UBs have
lapsed. We investigate the sensitivity of our results to measuring time in the unemployment register by also
analyzing the time from registering at the unemployment insurance ofﬁce until the next job starts.9 Our main
ﬁnding is that the results are not affected by the type of duration measure used in a quantitatively important
manner. Second, note that average unemployment duration is not affected by right censoring because spells
are observed until the end of 1998. Thus, fewer than 1% of all unemployment spells are right censored in the
data.
The empirical analysis extracts information on individuals entering unemployment from a job in the nonsteel sector in the time period 1/1986 until 12/1987 (before REBP) and in the time period 8/1989 until 7/1991
(during REBP). The ﬁrst time period covers the situation before REBP was introduced. We restrict attention
to the period after January 1986 because the AUR only started in 1986. Moreover, we do not include
information on the period 1/1988 until 5/1988 because spells starting in this time period may already be
affected by REBP.10 The ‘‘during REBP’’ time period covers the longest possible time period where REBP is
introduced but no other changes in beneﬁt entitlement take place. (Recall that the maximum unemployment
duration was changed as of August 1989.) Furthermore, the analysis disregards the fourth quarter inﬂow
into unemployment in the year 1991 because Lalive and Zweimüller (2004a) show that the inﬂow into
unemployment was very strongly affected just prior to the end of 1991.11
The analysis furthermore focuses on individuals with a ‘‘continuous’’ work history. Eligibility for REBP
(and special income support) requires 780 employment weeks (15 years) within the last 25 years—an actual-topotential experience ratio of at least 0.6. Since the ASSD only contains information as of January 1, 1972, we
can observe at most 19.5 years prior to entry into unemployment on average. In order to keep possible
misclassiﬁcation low, a continuous work history is deﬁned as a career with a ratio of actual to potential work
9

If time to job exceeds 209 weeks (because there is no information on the next job in the data) we censor time to next job at 209 weeks.
Note that ongoing spells are affected by REBP. However, once a job seeker has exhausted regular UBs he or she is no longer eligible
for REBP. Since the potential beneﬁt duration was at most 30 weeks prior to REBP, this sample selection ensures that REBP does not
affect the ‘‘before REBP’’ analysis strongly.
11
Arguably, this can be rationalized by the fact that it was not certain whether REBP would be extended. Firms and workers therefore
had a strong incentive to make use of the generous unemployment insurance rules provided by REBP.

experience (henceforth previous experience) since the year 1972 of at least 0.7. This ensures that only workers
who satisfy the work experience requirement with a very high probability are included in the sample.12
The data contain information on the month and year of birth, and month and year of entry into
unemployment. This allows calculating the age at entry into unemployment by counting the number of years
and months of a person’s life completed before entering unemployment. For instance, a job seeker born in
June 1940 who is entering unemployment in May 1990 is aged 49 years and 11 months. In contrast, a job
seeker born in the same month but entering unemployment in June 1990 is aged 50 years and 0 months.13 The
empirical analysis restricts attention to individuals aged 46–53 years (and 11 months) at the beginning of the
unemployment spell. This is the only age bracket where both women and men do not have access to early
retirement on the ﬁrst day of the unemployment spell. Second, because age is only recorded up to a precision
of one month, we allow for clustering of the regression errors at the age cell level to account for possible
speciﬁcation error as suggested in Card and Lee (2007).
The second identiﬁcation strategy identiﬁes the effect of REBP at the border between treated and control
regions.14 Fig. 1 shows the distribution of REBP across the 2361 communities in Austria. Interestingly, the
treated regions (communities with blue shading) were all located on a contiguous area located in the Eastern
part of Austria and stretching from the Northern border to the Southern border. The program covers
parts of the provinces Burgenland, Carinthia (Kärnten), Lower Austria (Niederösterreich), Upper Austria
(Oberösterreich), and Styria (Steiermark).
It is crucial to measure the distance of each community to the border between treated and control regions.
Fig. 1 shows that communities which appear to be located close to the border on the map need not be close in
economic terms because they are separated by mountainous terrain (for instance in the Alpine center of
Austria). We therefore use a measure that reﬂects travel time—an economically more relevant measure of
distance between locations than air distance. Speciﬁcally, the distance to the border of community A is the
number of minutes it takes to drive a car from a community across the border, i.e. to the closest community
12

The data contain information on employment dating back to the late 1940s for about 30% of all individuals (REV Daten). This
information can be used to assess the quality of the threshold rule used in the empirical analysis. Findings indicate that 61% of all job
seekers with an actual to potential experience ratio of 0.6–0.7 actually fulﬁll the 15 out of 25 years requirement. The corresponding ﬁgure is
81% for job seekers with a ratio of 0.7–0.8, it is 94% for job seekers with a ratio of 0.8–0.9, and it is 99% for job seekers with a ratio of
0.9–1. This suggests that the 0.7 threshold is successful in identifying eligible individuals (the average probability of being eligible exceeds
94%). Note, however, that we cannot concentrate on the sub-sample of individuals with REV information since this sub-sample is not a
random draw from the unemployment inﬂow.
13
Note that this job seeker may have been born on June 30, 1940 but entered unemployment on June 1, 1990 missing almost one month
to her or his 50th birthday. Results strongly suggest that this person was nevertheless eligible for REBP (see Fig. 2). Arguably, this can be
explained by the fact that the caseworkers in the unemployment insurance ofﬁce only consider month and year of birth and unemployment
entry when assessing a claimant’s eligibility status.

that is located on the other side of the border.15 This travel distance measure is superior to using air distance
between communities because it accounts for possible geographic barriers (mountains, rivers) between
communities that look adjacent on a map. The minimal distance from a community in the treated region to
the nearest control region community is 5 min. We normalize travel distance from this treated community to
the border to be zero because this community is, effectively, located exactly on the border between treated and
control communities.16
For control region communities we perform the same calculation with the only difference that we record the
negative of the travel distance by car. Thus non-negative values of the distance to border variable refer to
treated communities. Negative values of the distance to border refer to control communities. The analysis
identiﬁes the effect of REBP on unemployment duration at the border between treated and control
communities, i.e. at zero minutes distance to border.
The empirical analysis restricts attention to individuals living no farther than a 70 min car drive from the
border because the density of the inﬂow into unemployment is very low in communities located further than
70 min car distance from the border. Furthermore, we also exclude unemployment spells that start in Vienna
(a control region city located at 33 min from the border between treated and control regions) because Vienna is
a very dominant urban community characterized by long unemployment duration.
The key issue in terms of identiﬁcation is the location of steel plants in terms of distance to the border
between treated and control regions. Even though the analysis focuses on the non-steel inﬂow, the steel
restructuring operations may spill over to other industries. There are two main channels for spillovers. First,
industries that are supplying materials to the steel industry can be affected. Second, the reduction in steel
worker incomes may spill over to other industries via reduced demand for goods. The national steel holding’s
two largest plants are located in the city of Linz (Upper Austria), and Donawitz, located near the city of
Leoben (Styria). Our data indicate that it takes 24 min to drive from the city of Linz to the border between
treated and control regions. The distance from Donawitz to the border is even longer—34 min. Arguably, this
suggests that spillovers from steel do not affect estimates of the effect of REBP at the border between treated
and control regions.17
Table 1 reports key background statistics on the job seekers entering unemployment from a job in the nonsteel sector in the time during REBP (8/1989–7/1991), by gender, age and region of residence.18
Table 1 indicates that there are 4759 treated male individuals, that is individuals aged 50–53 years, living in
treated regions (Panel A, Column 1). Average age is slightly lower than 52 years reﬂecting the fact that the
inﬂow is concentrated somewhat among individuals closer to the 50 year threshold. On average, treated
individuals live about a 28 min car drive from the border between treated and control regions. About 83% of
all men who enter unemployment are married, and about 48% of the job seekers were previously employed in
construction.19
Table 1 shows that there are 4975 men starting an unemployment spell also in treated regions but aged
46–49 years (Panel A, Column 2). Clearly, average age (48 years) in this group is lower than in the group of
treated individuals. However, this ﬁrst control group appears to be living at roughly similar distance to the
border between treated and control regions and the younger group of job seekers living in treated regions is
quite comparable to the eligible older group of job seekers in terms of the family situation. In the control
15

The distance measure reﬂects the time required to drive from the center of community A to the center of the community on the other
side of the border using the fastest road connection between these two communities under normal conditions. We obtained this
information in 2000 from a commercial provider of rout planning software in Austria (DDS Digital Services). Note that the travel distance
by car measured in this paper may not properly reﬂect the travel distance at the beginning of the 1990s. Nevertheless, we believe that this
measure of travel distance is likely to contain important information on the geographic distance between communities because there were
no major changes to road infrastructure.
16
Speciﬁcally, we subtract 5 min travel distance from each treated region community’s distance to the border between regions.
17
Note that spillovers from steel are unlikely to bias the identiﬁcation strategy at the age 50 years threshold because these spillovers
affect both job seekers similarly on both sides of the threshold.
18
These control variables are used in the empirical analysis. In addition, the empirical analysis uses information on family situation,
education, nationality, wage in previous job, skill level (white collar vs. blue collar), and previous industry to control for possible
differences between treated and control spells.
19
Note that the high share of construction workers in the unemployment inﬂow reﬂects strong seasonal unemployment in the
construction sector rather than the relative size of this sector compared to other sectors.

communities, there are 8,537 men entering unemployment in the age group 50–53 years (Table 1, Panel A,
Column 3).20 Average age for control region job seekers is identical to treated individuals. However, these
individuals are living on average 39 min from the border between treated and control regions. This indicates
that the average control individual is living in a community that could be quite different due to geographic
location from the community of the average treated individual. Indeed, the construction sector inﬂow is much
larger in control regions (60%) than in treated regions (48%). This suggests paying particular attention to how
the construction share changes when approaching the border between treated and control regions. With
respect to the family situation job seekers in control regions (82% are married) are similar to job seekers in
treated regions (83% are married).
There are 3466 women entering unemployment who satisfy both the age and region of residence
requirement for REBP (Table 1 Panel B Column 1). The average age among women is 51.5 years;
about 0.3 years lower than the average age among treated men. This could be due to the fact that REBP might
have been more relevant among women near the age 50 threshold compared to men. Second, about 78% of all
eligible women are married and about 3% of these women were previously employed in the construction
sector.
Table 1 reports descriptive statistics on the two control groups for women (Panel B Columns 2 and 3).
There are 2193 women entering unemployment in the age bracket 46–49 years in the period with REBP in
treated regions (Panel B Column 2). The family situation of the job seekers who fail the age requirement is
quite different from the eligible group of job seekers. Whereas 78% of the eligible women are married,
only 70% of the women below the age 50 threshold are married. In terms of identiﬁcation, it is important to
see whether this difference occurs at the age threshold. The second control group comprises the 3625
women who do not live in treated regions but satisfy the age requirement (Panel B Column 3). Note
that average age in this group is 51.9 which is slightly higher than the average age in the treated group is 51.5
years. Moreover, the fraction married in the control group is again somewhat lower (72%) than in the treated
group (78%).

20

The inﬂow into unemployment is larger in the control regions than in treated regions because more people live and work in control
region communities than in treated regions.

4. Descriptive evidence on the effects of REBP
This section reports descriptive evidence on the effects of REBP on unemployment duration, on the effects
of age and distance to border before REBP was introduced, and on the effects of REBP on inﬂow composition
and on inﬂow size.
4.1. Results for men
Fig. 2 reports average unemployment duration by age at entry into unemployment for each age quarter
from 46 years and 1 quarter to 53 years and 4 quarters. The evidence is based on 9,734 individuals living in
treated regions, i.e. 4,759 treated individuals aged 50 years and older and 4,975 control individuals aged 46–49
years. All ﬁgures superimpose the ﬁt of a linear regression allowing for a discontinuity at the threshold and
linear trends in the assignment variable (age or distance to border) on both sides of the threshold (see Section 5
for further discussion on estimation).
Control individuals remain unemployed for 13 weeks on average. In contrast, average unemployment
duration exceeds 26 weeks in almost all age cells for individuals aged 50 years or older. There is a signiﬁcant
discontinuity in average unemployment duration that occurs between individuals aged 49 years and 4 quarters
and individuals aged 50 years and 1 quarter. This suggests that there is a strong effect of REBP on the average
duration of unemployment spells.
Fig. 3 identiﬁes the effect of REBP by comparing individuals living on both sides of the border between
treated and control regions. This ﬁgure is based on 13,296 individuals who are 50 years or older at the
beginning of their unemployment spell, i.e. the 4,759 treated individuals (who live in treated regions) and the
8,537 control individuals (who live in control regions).21 Average unemployment duration is roughly 13 weeks
in the control regions (negative values of distance to border). Furthermore, unemployment duration appears
21
The ﬁgure reports average unemployment duration for each distance to border cell of width 5 min, i.e. the ﬁrst cell reporting average
unemployment duration in communities located 65–69 min from the border between treated and control regions (67:6 min), the second
cell reporting evidence for communities at 60–64 min distance ð62:5 minÞ; . . ., and the last cell reporting evidence for the community
located 55–69 min from the border (62.5 min). Note that the cells at distance 10–14 min, 5–9 min to the border from the control region side,
and the cells 0–4 min, and 5–9 min distance to the border on the treated region side are aggregated because the cells close to the border are
based on fewer than 150 spells. For the same reason, the descriptive analysis aggregates the cells 55–59 min, 60–64 min, and 65–69 min
distance to border into one cell. Note, however, that the econometric analysis is based on the continuous distance to border measure.

to decrease slightly when approaching the border between treated and control regions. In contrast, as soon as
we enter the treated region, average unemployment duration increases signiﬁcantly to more than 26 weeks.
This suggests, again, that REBP strongly increases average unemployment duration among men living close to
the border between treated and control regions. In line with control regions, there is a negative relationship
between average unemployment duration and distance to border in treated regions.
The evidence in Figs. 2 and 3 suggest that there are important discontinuities in the duration of
unemployment at age 50 and at the border between treated and control regions. Have these discontinuities
been caused by REBP? This is true only if the counterfactual average duration without REBP varies smoothly
with age and distance to border. In particular, jumps in unemployment duration at age 50 and at the border
that occur for reasons other than beneﬁt eligibility have to be ruled out. I therefore investigate whether
average duration of unemployment varies smoothly before REBP was introduced. Fig. 4 reports average
unemployment duration as a function of age and distance to border in the period from 1/1986 until 12/1987,
i.e. 2.5 years to 0.5 years before REBP was introduced.
Fig. 4A reports the effects of age on unemployment duration. Men who are 46 years old remain unemployed
for about 13 weeks on average. As age increases, so does average unemployment duration. Men who are 53

years old when registering at the unemployment ofﬁce are expected to be unemployed for about 16 weeks.
Importantly, there are some differences in terms of average unemployment duration at the age 50 threshold.
Men who are in the age bracket 49 years and 4 quarters are unemployed for roughly 14 weeks. In contrast,
men who have just celebrated their 50th birthday remain unemployed for 17 weeks on average, and the linear
regression suggests that this difference is statistically signiﬁcant. This evidence thus suggests that it may be
important to account for pre-existing differences in average unemployment duration at the age 50 years
threshold.
Fig. 4B assesses how average unemployment duration varies with distance to border. Before REBP, average
unemployment duration is about 13 weeks in control region communities at 70 min distance to the border.
Duration of job search increases monotonically from less than 13 weeks to about 20 weeks when approaching
the border between treated and control regions. Importantly, there is no signiﬁcant difference in average
unemployment duration on both sides of the border. The evidence in Fig. 4B thus suggests that identifying the
effect of REBP by contrasting average unemployment duration in communities located at both sides of the
border is a meaningful identiﬁcation strategy.
For this identiﬁcation strategy to be valid, however, the composition of the inﬂow pool needs to be balanced
at the age and border threshold in the period with REBP. Two important characteristics are marital status and
previous employment in construction. Marital status is important primarily because it is related to the
potential level of the social assistance transfers. The idea is that married individuals are more likely to live with
a working spouse. Since means testing focuses on household rather than individual income, the likelihood that
married individuals will receive social assistance is lower. This suggests that married individuals remain
unemployed shorter than non-married individuals all else equal. Construction employment is important
because it proxies for seasonal unemployment which reﬂects unemployment due to a temporary rather than a
permanent layoff. Table 1 presents descriptive statistics on these important background characteristics and
shows that the share married is not balanced with respect to age and the construction share is not balanced
between treated and control regions. Fig. 5 therefore assesses how the composition of the inﬂow into
unemployment varies with age and distance to border.
Focusing on men entering unemployment in treated regions in the age bracket 45–53 years, Fig. 5A reveals
that marital status indeed appears to be correlated with age. In the age bracket 46–48 years, the share married
increases from about 75% to about 80%. Importantly, there is no discontinuity at the age 50 threshold.
Roughly 80% of all job seekers who are aged 50 years and 1 quarter are married. The share married increases
from 80% to about 86% in the age bracket 50–53.
Fig. 5B discusses inﬂow composition with respect to previous employment in construction as a function of
distance to border. In control regions, the share previously employed in construction is about 60% irrespective
of distance to the border between treated and control regions. Just on the other side of the border, the share
previously employed in construction decreases quite strongly but insigniﬁcantly to 53%. The share previously

employed in construction decreases further as distance to border increases and reaches a level of less than 40%
in communities located at distance 40 min to the border. Moving further away from the border, we ﬁnd that
the construction share increases again to about 50%.
A ﬁnal concern with the identiﬁcation strategy refers to how likely it is that ﬁrms and individuals
manipulate their location on either side of the threshold. While it is clearly difﬁcult to manipulate one’s age, it
is very well possible that ﬁrms and individuals can manipulate the age at entry into unemployment. Fig. 6
therefore assesses whether the relative size of the inﬂow into unemployment is affected by the REBP.22
Fig. 6A reports relative inﬂow for the age based identiﬁcation strategy among men. Relative inﬂow is the
likelihood ratio of age, i.e. the ratio of the density of age in treated regions to the density of age in control
regions.23 Fig. 6A indicates that the likelihood ratio is close to 1 throughout the entire support suggesting that
there is no concentration of the inﬂow at a particular age bracket. This suggests that manipulation of the age
at entry into unemployment does not occur among men.
Fig. 6B reports relative inﬂow for the border based identiﬁcation strategy. Relative inﬂow is the likelihood
ratio of distance to border, i.e. the ratio between the density of distance to border in the age bracket 50–53
years to the density of distance to border in the age bracket 46–49 years. In control communities, relative
inﬂow is 1 indicating that the number of older workers entering unemployment is almost identical to the
number of younger workers. Relative inﬂow is also close to 1 in treated communities located no farther than
30 min from the border. Relative inﬂow becomes more noisy in communities located 35 min and more from
the border reﬂecting the fact that these distance to border cells are relatively small. Again, there appears to be
no manipulation of location of residence.
4.2. Results for women
Fig. 7 concentrates on women entering unemployment in treated regions in the age bracket 46–53 years and
it displays three striking facts.24 First, there is a very salient increase in unemployment duration at the age 50
22
It would be desirable to report the unemployment inﬂow rate, that is, the number of spells entering unemployment relative to
employment. Our employment data, however, are based on the location of the previous employer rather than of the location of the
individual’s residence. This means that it is not possible to calculate unemployment risk appropriately. Note that relative inﬂow is,
however, informative on inﬂow risk (unemployment inﬂow divided by employment) if the age structure of employment is identical in
treated and control regions up to a constant.
23
Speciﬁcally, the density in treated (control) regions is the ratio of the number of spells observed in each age bracket relative to the total
number of spells in treated (control) regions. Each point in Fig. 6A is the ratio between these two densities.
24
Note that the y-axis for women covers the ﬁrst three years in an unemployment spell rather than merely the ﬁrst year as for men.
Women who are 46 years old remain unemployed for about 20 weeks on average; this is somewhat longer than average unemployment

threshold. Whereas the women who are slightly younger than the threshold leave unemployment on average
after about 16 weeks, women who are slightly older than the threshold do not exit unemployment for more
than 130 weeks on average. Thus, there appears to be a strongly signiﬁcant increase in unemployment
duration by at least 110 weeks. Second, in the age bracket 50–53 years, there is a very strong decrease in
average unemployment duration from more than 130 weeks (age 50 years and 1 quarter) to less than 52 weeks
(age 53 years and 4 quarters). This evidence is consistent with an interpretation that a substantial fraction of
eligible women remain unemployed until they turn 54, the minimum age required in the special income
support program.25 Third, in contrast to men, there appears to be a decline in average unemployment duration
from about 26 weeks at age 48 to about 16 weeks at age 49.
Fig. 8 uses variation in distance to border among women aged 50 years or older to identify the effect of
REBP. There is hardly any variation in the duration of job search as one approaches the border between
treated and control regions from the control region side. Average unemployment duration oscillates around 26
weeks, i.e. almost twice the average for men (see Fig. 3). However, as one crosses the border between treated
communities and control communities, unemployment duration increases signiﬁcantly from 26 weeks to a
level of 78 weeks, i.e. an increase by exactly 1 year. Thus, there appears to be a tremendous increase in average
unemployment duration associated with REBP. Note that the effect of REBP at the border is much weaker
than the effect of REBP at age 50 years.
Using pre-program data for women, we ﬁnd that there is neither a signiﬁcant discontinuity in expected
unemployment duration at the age 50 threshold nor at the border between treated and control regions.
Moreover, inﬂow composition does not appear differ at the border between treated and control regions; the
share married does not signiﬁcantly differ on both sides of the border. In contrast, inﬂow composition appears
to be signiﬁcantly affected at the age threshold. Women aged 50 years are signiﬁcantly and quantitatively
importantly (6.5 percentage points) more likely to be married than women who just fail the age threshold.
Fig. 9 discusses the effects of REBP on the relative size of the inﬂow among women. There is a striking spike
in the number of women entering unemployment exactly at age 50 years and 1 quarter in treated regions
relative to control regions (Fig. 9A). Whereas relative inﬂow is around 1 in the age group 45–49 years, relative
(footnote continued)
duration among men in the same age bracket (see Fig. 2). This can be explained by seasonal (construction sector) unemployment being
much more relevant for men than for women.
25
Note, however, that it is not true that all women at the age 50 threshold are using REBP as an early retirement pathway. If this were
the case the average duration of unemployment would have to exceed 200 weeks for women entering unemployment at age 50 instead of
reaching a level of 141 weeks.

inﬂow peaks at almost 3 in the age cell 50 years and 1 quarter.26 With increasing age, however, relative inﬂow
drops strongly and reaches a level of about 1 in the age bracket 51–52 years. Relative inﬂow is below 1 in the
age group 53 years.27 The fact that the inﬂow size is affected strongly by REBP suggests that the age based
identiﬁcation strategy could be affected by inﬂow effects.
Interestingly, in contrast to the age based identiﬁcation strategy, the border based identiﬁcation strategy
appears to be much less strongly affected by inﬂow size effects (Fig. 9B). Relative inﬂow increases
monotonically and quite smoothly from control communities at distance 70 min from the border to treated
26
Speciﬁcally, in control regions there are 256 spells in the age bracket 50 years and 1 quarter. In treated regions, there are 596 (!) spells
in the age bracket 50 years and 1 quarter. Relative inﬂow is 0:105 ¼ 596=5659 (total age 46–49 inﬂow in treated regions) divided by
0:036 ¼ 256=7063 (total age 46–49 inﬂow in control regions). There is no evidence that these spells are due to the closing of one large plant.
27
This is due to the fact that the size of the inﬂow increases quite strongly at age 53 years in control regions, i.e. the age when women in
control regions can also use the UB system as a pathway to early retirement because potential beneﬁt duration is 1 year.

communities at distance 20 min from the border from a likelihood ratio of about 0.6 to a likelihood ratio of 1.
On the other side of the border, relative in ﬂow is about 1.2 which is only slightly and insigniﬁcantly higher
than relative inﬂow in control communities providing information on the counterfactual unemployment
duration without REBP. This suggests that the border based identiﬁcation strategy is less affected by the
effects of REBP on the size of the unemployment inﬂow.
Taken together, these descriptive analyses suggest that an estimation strategy that measures the
discontinuity at the threshold identiﬁes the causal effect of extended beneﬁts on unemployment duration at
both thresholds for men and at the border threshold for women.28
5. Identiﬁcation and estimation
The goal of the regression discontinuity approach is to measure the discontinuity in expected unemployment
duration at the assignment threshold S0 (age 50 years or distance to border 0 min). Because the design in the
REBP context is sharp, this discontinuity identiﬁes the average causal effect for the threshold population of job
seekers if the expected non-treatment unemployment duration is continuous at the threshold (Hahn et al., 2001).
I have provided three pieces of evidence that allow discussing the validity of this identifying assumption in the
previous section. First, I have provided evidence on how expected unemployment duration varies with S in the
time period before REBP was introduced. This allows assessing whether continuity of the non-treatment outcome
is fulﬁlled without the program. However, introducing the program may invalidate evidence before the program
was introduced. In particular, ﬁrms and workers may agree to postpone entry into unemployment until the
eligibility criteria have been satisﬁed. I therefore provide, second, evidence that allows assessing whether important
background characteristics such as marital status or previous employment in construction are balanced at the
assignment threshold. Third, I also provide evidence on the effects of REBP on the relative density of the
assignment variable S in the inﬂow into unemployment in Figs. 6 and 9. The idea is straightforward. Noncontinuity of the density of S indicates that ﬁrms and workers react to REBP. This reaction can induce a bias in the
regression discontinuity estimates if additional layoffs are selective, i.e. have different counterfactual
unemployment duration. Fig. 9A suggests that there is an abnormal reaction at the age threshold for women.
The absence of a dip just before age 50 suggests, however, that this reaction has not been caused by ﬁrms wanting
to provide an early retirement option to women whom they expect to remain long-term unemployed. Section 6
addresses the age threshold reaction by providing results for a sub-group of women with information on previous
unemployment duration. This allows assessing whether there is selection bias within this sub-group.
The focus of RDD estimation is on identifying the discontinuity in average unemployment duration Y at the
assignment threshold S 0 . Speciﬁcally, I use the following linear regression:
Y i ¼ a0 þ a1 Di þ b0 ðSi  S0 Þ þ b1 Di ðSi  S0 Þ þ i .

(1)

The parameter a1 measures the average causal effect of REBP on unemployment duration at the assignment
threshold S 0 . The parameters b0 and b1 capture the direct effects of the assignment variable S on average
unemployment duration.29
28

Firms cannot respond at the border threshold because workers have to be living for at least 6 months in treated regions. Yet, ﬁrms also
do not appear to delay laying off a 49 year old until she or he is 50 years old. This can be understood by considering the theory behind a
layoff. A ﬁrm induces a layoff if the expected contribution (i.e. productivity minus total costs) of a particular worker to ﬁrm proﬁt is
negative. Suppose the ﬁrm realizes at date t that worker i—aged 49 years and 11 months—contribution to ﬁrm proﬁt is negative. The ﬁrm
thus has a strong incentive to ﬁre the worker at date t. In contrast, the worker’s expected utility would be improved if the ﬁrm delayed the
layoff from date t to date t þ 1 because the worker would be eligible for 209 weeks of extended beneﬁts instead of 39 weeks. This means that
there are gains from trade. These gains can be realized if the worker could propose to the ﬁrm that he or she will take a wage cut that is
sufﬁcient for expected contribution to the ﬁrm’s proﬁt to be non-negative. In the present context, however, such a trade is highly unlikely to
take place for at least two reasons. First, the worker is only slightly better off in the system with extended beneﬁts because extended beneﬁts
are valuable for workers who exhaust UBs. In the Austrian context, only 1 out of 14 workers in treated regions exhaust 39 weeks of beneﬁts.
Second, even if the gains from trade were large, it is not possible for workers and ﬁrms to implement a temporary wage cut because unions
would not agree with such a deal. This means that it is not possible for workers and ﬁrms to delay entry into unemployment.
29
Note that the data on S—age at entry into unemployment and distance to border between treated and control regions—are not
measured on a continuous scale. This introduces a speciﬁcation error into model (1). Random speciﬁcation error introduces
heteroscedasticity in the variance–covariance matrix of the error term and can be addressed by clustering on the cells of S that are observed
in the data (Card and Lee, 2007).

The crucial issue in RDD estimation is the speciﬁcation of the correlation between the outcome Y and the
assignment variable S. This paper proposes two ways of assessing whether the two-sided linear model
speciﬁcation (1) is appropriate. The ﬁrst sensitivity analysis augments the regression with quadratic and cubic
terms in ðS  S 0 Þ. This is a parametric method of assessing the sensitivity of our results. Second, I discuss
sensitivity to functional form applying a semiparametric version of model (1) to the data (Porter, 2003).
Intuitively, the local linear regression weighs data points such that information close to the threshold gets
more weight than information further away from the threshold.30
The empirical analysis also addresses two additional concerns. First, the assumption of continuity may not
hold even before REBP was introduced. The sensitivity of the results based on model (1) can be assessed by
using information before REBP was introduced.31 Second, it is possible to improve the efﬁciency of the
estimates by including observed characteristics into the regression. The sensitivity analysis therefore adds all
observed characteristics to the basic model (1).
6. Econometric results
This section presents the econometric estimates of the effects of REBP on unemployment duration. Table 2
presents results for men, based on the age threshold in Panel A, and based on the border threshold in Panel B.
The ﬁrst column reports estimates that contrast average unemployment duration on both sides of the age
threshold. Results indicate that unemployment duration is 14.6 weeks longer among men in the age bracket
50–53 years compared to men aged 46–49 years. The second column reports the results from the basic model
(1). Results indicate that REBP prolongs unemployment duration by 14.8 weeks rather than 14.6 weeks.32
Moreover, Fig. 2 shows that the basic model ﬁts the threshold data points well.
Because there is not necessarily a linear trend in the outcome, column 3 in Table 2 reports results based on a
cubic speciﬁcation (again on both sides of the threshold). Results indicate that the effect of REBP is weaker
than in the basic model (11.2 weeks as opposed to 14.8 weeks). Column 4 in Table 2 reports results that use
Epanechnikov kernel weights to give more weight to observations that are close to the age 50 threshold. The
local linear estimate of the effect of REBP on unemployment duration is 12.7 weeks, again lower than the
basic model estimate of 14.8 weeks.33 Column 5 accounts for possible pre-existing differences in
unemployment duration at the age 50 threshold by using information before REBP was introduced. Results
suggest that REBP prolongs unemployment by about 11.3 weeks—a weaker effect than in the basic model.
Column 6 absorbs random variation by adding observed characteristics. Results suggest that REBP prolongs
unemployment duration by 13.8 weeks.
The second identiﬁcation strategy compares men entering unemployment living on both sides of the border
between treated and control regions (Table 2, Panel B). Contrasting treated and control regions produces a
prima facie treatment effect of about 13.9 weeks of REBP on average unemployment duration (column 1).

where K h ðuÞ ¼ 3=4ð1  ðu=hÞ2 ÞIðjujohÞ is the Epanechnikov kernel, and h is the bandwidth. Note the basic model (1) is a special case of
model (2) obtained by setting the bandwidth to 1, i.e. weighting all observations equally. In the empirical analysis, I set the bandwidth to
2 years at the age threshold and to 30 min at the border threshold. This ensures that about one half of all the observations from model (1)
are used in model (2). I also investigate sensitivity of estimates to bandwidth choice. Speciﬁcally, I also use bandwidths 1 year or 3 years for
the age strategy and bandwidths 20 or 40 min for the border strategy.

is estimated where T i ¼ 1 if the unemployment spell starts in the ‘‘during REBP’’ period, and T i ¼ 0 otherwise. Again, the parameter a1
provides the before–during-RDD (BD-RDD) estimate of the effect of REBP on unemployment duration.
32
The corresponding estimate using time to next job is 11.1 weeks.
33
The local linear regression reported in Table 2 uses a bandwidth of 2 years. Estimates are not sensitive to changes in the bandwidth
(effect is 12.594 with a 1 year bandwidth, and 13.467 with a 3 years bandwidth).

Adding a linear trend in distance to region—as in the basic model (1)—indicates that REBP leads to an
increase in unemployment duration by 13.6 weeks rather than 13.9 weeks.34 Again, ﬁtting the quite non-linear
trend observed in the raw data with a linear trend captures the situation at the threshold quite well (see Fig. 3).
Adding a quadratic and cubic term in distance to border leads to a stronger, albeit insigniﬁcant, estimate of
the effect of REBP on unemployment duration (column 3). The local linear estimate of the corresponding
effect is 12.6 weeks (column 4)—weaker than the basic model estimate of 13.6 weeks.35 Accounting for preexisting differences in unemployment duration at the border suggests that REBP prolongs unemployment
duration by 11.8 weeks (column 5), and adding observed characteristics suggests that REBP prolongs
unemployment duration by about 12.0 weeks.
Turning to results for women (Table 3), I now discuss results based on the age strategy (panel A) and the
border strategy (panel B). Table 3 shows that contrasting women aged 50–53 years with women aged 46–49
years produces a prima facie effect of REBP on unemployment duration of 68.2 weeks (column 1). This effect
is, however, downward biased since unemployment duration decreases strongly with age among women aged
50 or older. Adding a two-sided linear trend produces an estimate of about 109.6 weeks in the basic model
speciﬁcation (column 2).36 The simple identiﬁcation strategy is in line with the raw data below the threshold but
it is below average unemployment duration at age 50 and 1 quarters (see Fig. 7). A model that adds quadratic
34

The corresponding estimate using time to next job is 20.1 weeks.
The local linear regression reported in Table 2 uses a bandwidth of 30 min. Estimates are somewhat sensitive to changes in the
bandwidth (effect is 16.328 with a 20 min bandwidth, and 11.785 with a 40 min bandwidth).
36
The corresponding estimate using time to next job is 110.2 weeks.

and cubic terms in age to the basic model (1) produces a much stronger effect of REBP of 125.7 weeks
(column 3). The local linear estimate of the effect of REBP on unemployment duration is 121.8 weeks—almost
in line with the cubic model estimate of 125.7 weeks but again larger than the basic model estimate.37 The
BD-RDD analysis produces an estimate of the effect of REBP on unemployment duration of 109.4 weeks which
is exactly in line with the basic model estimate (column 5). Moreover, adding control variables to this
speciﬁcation tends to reduce the treatment effect by about 7 weeks, from 109.6 weeks to 102.6 weeks (column 6).
Note that the particular feature of the age identiﬁcation strategy is that the unemployment inﬂow near the
age 50 years threshold is strongly affected by REBP (Fig. 9). This means that average unemployment duration
below the age 50 threshold is not informative on the counterfactual situation for the age 50 unemployment
inﬂow. One way of addressing this concern is to ﬁnd pre-program information on the average unemployment
duration for women who are aged 50–53 years during REBP. This is possible for women who have been
repeatedly unemployed women. Fig. 10A reports the average ﬁrst unemployment spell duration in the preprogram period conditional on age attained at the start of the during-program spell.38 There is no
quantitatively important discontinuity in unemployment duration at the threshold for repeatedly unemployed
women. The linear regression indicates that unemployment duration is 2.8 weeks longer (with std. err. 1.5
weeks) for women aged 50 years compared to women aged 49 years and 11 months.
37
The local linear regression reported in Table 3 uses a bandwidth of 2 years. Estimates are not sensitive to changes in the bandwidth
(effect is 123.503 with a 1 year bandwidth, and 119.981 with a 3 years bandwidth).
38
Clearly, for individuals aged 46–47 the chances are very small that such information is available because the data set is limited to the
age group 46–53 years. There are 1,279 out of 56,459 spells present in this analysis; 978 out of 3,466 spells for women age 50 years or older;
279 out of 2,193 spells for women age 49 or younger.

Fig. 10. Results for repeatedly unemployed women. Pre-program refers to women with pre-program unemployment duration
information. During–program refers to the same women when REBP in force.

Fig. 10B plots average during-program duration for the sample of women with information on pre-program
duration. There is a strong and signiﬁcant increase in unemployment duration at the threshold. While
repeatedly unemployed women age 50 years are expected to remain unemployed for about 85 weeks, the
counterfactual unemployment duration without extended beneﬁts is only 11 weeks. Thus, extended beneﬁts
appear to increase average unemployment duration by 74.8 weeks (std. err. 6.5 weeks). This estimate of the
causal effect is weaker than all of the estimates reported in Table 3 Panel A. There are at least two
explanations for this weaker effect. On one hand, effects reported previously could be biased. On the other
hand, the repeatedly unemployed sub-group could be less responsive to extended beneﬁts in general. It is
possible to assess the second explanation by studying repeatedly unemployed men. The average causal effect of
extended beneﬁts for repeatedly unemployed men is 8.6 weeks (std. err. 3.2 weeks). This effect is smaller than
the average causal effect for all men; repeatedly unemployed men are less responsive to extended beneﬁts than
the average job seeker. This implies that identiﬁcation strategy using information on repeatedly unemployed
women identiﬁes a lower bound of 74.8 weeks for the average causal effect of extended beneﬁts for all women.
Turning to the results obtained when contrasting unemployment duration for women living on both sides of
the border between treated and control regions (Table 3, Panel B), we ﬁnd that unemployment lasts 62.6 weeks
longer in treated regions compared to control regions (column 1). Adding a two-sided linear trend reduces the
estimated treatment effect to 50.6 weeks (column 2).39 Fitting a cubic polynomial on both sides of the border
reduces the estimate of the treatment effect somewhat (estimate is 46.4 weeks) but doing so reduces the
precision of the estimate considerably (standard error increases from 6.0 weeks to 15.8 weeks; column 3). The
local linear estimate of the effect of REBP on unemployment duration is 43.3 weeks (column 4), again slightly
weaker than the basic model estimate of 50.6 weeks.40 Accounting for pre-existing differences in
unemployment duration at the border between treated and control regions produces a slightly larger
treatment effect of 54.0 weeks.41 Adding control variables to the linear speciﬁcation suggests that REBP tends
to increase unemployment duration by about 44.9 weeks (column 6). Interestingly, we again ﬁnd that the
relatively simple speciﬁcation with a two-sided linear trend appears to capture the discontinuity in the raw
data rather well (see Fig. 8).

39

The corresponding estimate using time to next job is 47.5 weeks.
The local linear regression reported in Table 3 uses a bandwidth of 30 min. Estimates are not at all sensitive to changes in the
bandwidth (effect is 44.576 with a 20 min bandwidth, and 43.534 with a 40 min bandwidth).
41
Note that there is a positive difference in unemployment duration between the treated and control communities at the border. Thus,
one would expect the BD-RDD estimate in column 5 to be weaker than the levels estimate in Column 2. However, note that the BD-RDD
estimate uses information from all communities to calculate the pre-existing differences. Applying the basic model to data before REBP
suggests that the difference in unemployment duration before REBP was introduced is negative (3:5 weeks).

7. Conclusions
Austria implemented in the late 1980s and early 1990s a unique program that provides 209 weeks of UB
duration but only to individuals aged 50 years or older who have been living in certain parts of Austria and
satisfy a work requirement. Because the program was strictly targeted with respect to age and region, this
paper proposes to evaluate the effects of this program using a RDD. The basic idea is that job seekers who just
fail the age or residence requirement may provide useful information on the counterfactual situation for
eligible workers who just satisfy the requirement. Moreover, because women have access to early retirement at
age 54 years but men have access to early retirement only at age 59 years, this program also offers a unique
opportunity to learn about the interactions between the pension system and unemployment insurance.
Results for men indicate that extended beneﬁt duration increases unemployment duration. The
identiﬁcation strategy at the age threshold measures the effects of an increase from 39 weeks to 209
weeks—by 170 weeks. The duration of job search is prolonged by about 14.8 weeks by this treatment. The
identiﬁcation strategy that compares job seekers living on both sides of the border between treated and control
regions identiﬁes the effect of a treatment with slightly smaller dose, an increase by 3 years, from 52 weeks to
209 weeks. The estimated effect on unemployment is slightly smaller, 13.6 weeks rather than 14.8 weeks.
Taking the ratio of effect and treatment dose, we ﬁnd that each week of extended beneﬁts produces about 0.09
additional weeks of unemployment duration or equivalently that it takes about 11 weeks of beneﬁt duration to
add one week of unemployment duration.42
Comparing our ﬁndings for women and men, the following patterns emerge. First, we ﬁnd that the effects of
REBP for women are much larger than the effects of REBP for men. The lower bound on the effect of REBP
on unemployment duration at the age threshold is 74.8 weeks for women—about 5 times the effect for men.
The effect of REBP for women on living on the border between treated and control regions is 50.6 weeks—
almost 4 times the effect for men. Second, the effect of REBP at the age threshold is much larger than the
effect at the border threshold. Arguably, this is because the population treated at the age threshold has to wait
much longer to reach the early retirement age of 54 years than the population treated at the border threshold.
Because treated women at the border are 51.5 years old, the average distance to early retirement is shorter
(2.5 years) for the border strategy than for the age strategy (4.0 years). Taking the ratio of the causal effect to
distance to early retirement (in weeks), indicates that women tend to remain unemployed about 20 weeks
longer for every year of beneﬁt duration that provides a direct pathway into early retirement.43 Thus Austrian
unemployment insurance provided a quantitatively important pathway into early retirement.

Note that our results agree with the ﬁndings in Card and Levine (2000) and are somewhat larger than the result in Lalive and
Zweimüller (2004b). The ﬁndings reported in this paper may differ from Lalive and Zweimüller (2004b) for at least two reasons. First,
Lalive and Zweimüller (2004b) apply a differences-in-differences identiﬁcation strategy that measures the overall effect of treatment on the
treated rather than the effect of treatment at the threshold. Second, simulations in Lalive and Zweimüller (2004b) apply to a reference
individual rather than the average unemployment duration of eligible individuals.
43
Interestingly, the standardized affects agree very much at the age threshold (74.8 weeks/(4 years  52 weeks/year) ¼ 0:360) and at the
border threshold (50.6 weeks/(2.5 years  52 weeks/year) ¼ 0:391). This suggests that the lower bound of 74.8 weeks at the age threshold is
close to the actual causal effect for all women.
