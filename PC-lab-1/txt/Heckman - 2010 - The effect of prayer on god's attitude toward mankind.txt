THE EFFECT OF PRAYER ON GOD’S ATTITUDE TOWARD MANKIND
JAMES HECKMAN*

This paper uses data available from the National Opinion Research Center’s
(NORC) survey on religious attitudes and powerful statistical methods to
evaluate the effect of prayer on the attitude of God toward human beings. (JEL
C21, Z12)

INTRODUCTION

where f#(x) is the derivative of f(X ) at X 5 x.
Thus, from the population distribution of
prayer, we can estimate the population regression function of God’s attitude as a function of
prayer. For a derivation, see Singh (1977).

This article uses data available from the
National Opinion Research Center’s survey
on religious attitudes and powerful statistical
methods to evaluate the effect of prayer on the
attitude of God toward human beings.
The technique—due to Singh (1977)—is
briefly described here. Let Y be God’s attitude
arrayed on a scale ranging from 0 to 1. This is
an unobserved variable. Let X be the intensity
of prayer in the population. It too is scaled
between 0 and 1. The population density of
prayer is summarized by a univariate density
f(X ), which has been estimated by Father
Greeley (1972).
Accept on faith that the conditional density
of X given Y is of the form:
ð1Þ

II. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION

Greeley estimates that f(X) is bimodal for X
scaled between 0 and 1. Many people almost
never pray and many others pray a lot. Using
Greeley’s numbers, we reach the following
important conclusions reported in Table 1,
where ‘‘t’’ statistics for the Parzen (1962)
kernel estimator of f(X) are presented in
parentheses. See Figure 1, which graphs the
estimated relationship at points of evaluation.
The empirical conclusion from this analysis is
important. A little prayer does no good and may
make things worse. Much prayer helps a lot.

where a(Y) is an unknown, continuous, positive, and differentiable function. Singh demonstrates that under his conditions:

DISCUSSION

Using a powerful method due to Singh, we
have established a relationship between God’s
attitude toward man and the amount of prayer

evoked a response from Father Andrew Greeley, the noted
Catholic priest and sociologist, which I attach. Ivan

transmitted to God. The method presented
here is applicable to a number of important
problems. Provided conditional density (1) is
assumed, we do not need to observe a variable
to compute its conditional expectation with
respect to another variable whose density
can be estimated. For example, one can extend
current empirical work in a variety of areas of
economics to estimate the effect of income on
happiness or the effect of income inequality on
democracy. We conjecture that this powerful
method can be extended to the more general
case when X is not observed either.

time but the reaction, thus far, has always been that She
was not home. Econometric models are much neater!
I’m enclosing a copy of a brief memo of mine about the
persistence of prayer. My colleague, Phil Morgan, has
developed some log linear models which show that prayer
increases with age because, the older people are, the more
likely they are to believe that prayer works. This may be
wishful thinking, but the fact that it’s wishful thinking
doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s not true!
And the attitude that prayer works seems to be a life
cycle rather than a generational or cohort effect.
The next thing to inquire about is whether the saints
are listening!
