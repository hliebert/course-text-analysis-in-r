Summary We revisit the classic semi-parametric problem of inference on a low-dimensional
parameter θ0 in the presence of high-dimensional nuisance parameters η0 . We depart from the
classical setting by allowing for η0 to be so high-dimensional that the traditional assumptions
(e.g. Donsker properties) that limit complexity of the parameter space for this object break
down. To estimate η0 , we consider the use of statistical or machine learning (ML) methods,
which are particularly well suited to estimation in modern, very high-dimensional cases.
ML methods perform well by employing regularization to reduce variance and trading
off regularization bias with overfitting in practice. However, both regularization bias and
overfitting in estimating η0 cause a heavy bias in estimators of θ0 that are obtained by
naively plugging ML estimators of η0 into estimating equations for θ0 . This bias results in
the naive estimator failing to be N −1/2 consistent, where N is the sample size. We show that
the impact of regularization bias and overfitting on estimation of the parameter of interest θ0
can be removed by using two simple, yet critical, ingredients: (1) using Neyman-orthogonal
moments/scores that have reduced sensitivity with respect to nuisance parameters to estimate
θ0 ; (2) making use of cross-fitting, which provides an efficient form of data-splitting. We
call the resulting set of methods double or debiased ML (DML). We verify that DML
delivers point estimators that concentrate in an N −1/2 -neighbourhood of the true parameter
values and are approximately unbiased and normally distributed, which allows construction
of valid confidence statements. The generic statistical theory of DML is elementary and
simultaneously relies on only weak theoretical requirements, which will admit the use of a
broad array of modern ML methods for estimating the nuisance parameters, such as random
forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, and various hybrids and ensembles of
these methods. We illustrate the general theory by applying it to provide theoretical properties
of the following: DML applied to learn the main regression parameter in a partially linear
regression model; DML applied to learn the coefficient on an endogenous variable in a
partially linear instrumental variables model; DML applied to learn the average treatment
effect and the average treatment effect on the treated under unconfoundedness; DML applied

to learn the local average treatment effect in an instrumental variables setting. In addition to
these theoretical applications, we also illustrate the use of DML in three empirical examples.

1. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION
Motivation
We develop a series of simple results for obtaining root-N consistent estimation, where N is
the sample size, and valid inferential statements about a low-dimensional parameter of interest,
θ0 , in the presence of a high-dimensional or ‘highly complex’ nuisance parameter, η0 . The
parameter of interest will typically be a causal parameter or treatment effect parameter, and we
consider settings in which the nuisance parameter will be estimated using machine learning (ML)
methods, such as random forests, lasso or post-lasso, neural nets, boosted regression trees, and
various hybrids and ensembles of these methods. These ML methods are able to handle many
covariates and they provide natural estimators of nuisance parameters when these parameters are
highly complex. Here, highly complex formally means that the entropy of the parameter space
for the nuisance parameter is increasing with the sample size in a way that moves us outside the
traditional framework considered in the classical semi-parametric literature where the complexity
of the nuisance parameter space is taken to be sufficiently small. The main contribution of this
paper is to offer a general and simple procedure for estimating and to perform inference on θ0
that is formally valid in these highly complex settings.
E XAMPLE 1.1. (PARTIALLY L INEAR R EGRESSION) As a lead example, consider the following
partially linear regression (PLR) model as in Robinson (1988):
Y = Dθ0 + g0 (X) + U,
D = m0 (X) + V ,

E[U | X, D] = 0,

(1.1)

E[V | X] = 0.

(1.2)

Here, Y is the outcome variable, D is the policy/treatment variable of interest, vector
X = (X1 , . . . , Xp )
consists of other controls, and U and V are disturbances.1 The first equation is the main equation,
and θ0 is the main regression coefficient that we would like to infer. If D is exogenous conditional
on controls X, θ0 has the interpretation of the treatment effect parameter or ‘lift’ parameter in
business applications. The second equation keeps track of confounding, namely the dependence
of the treatment variable on controls. This equation is not of interest per se but it is important
for characterizing and removing regularization bias. The confounding factors X affect the policy
variable D via the function m0 (X) and the outcome variable via the function g0 (X). In many
applications, the dimension p of vector X is large relative to N . To capture the feature that p is not
vanishingly small relative to the sample size, modern analyses then model p as increasing with
the sample size, which causes traditional assumptions that limit the complexity of the parameter
space for the nuisance parameters η0 = (m0 , g0 ) to fail.
1 We consider the case where D is a scalar for simplicity. Extension to the case where D is a vector of fixed, finite
dimension is accomplished by introducing an equation such as (1.2) for each element of the vector.

Double/debiased machine learning

Regularization bias. A naive approach to estimation of θ0 using ML methods would be, for
example, to construct a sophisticated ML estimator D θ̂0 + ĝ0 (X) for learning the regression
function Dθ0 + g0 (X).2 Suppose, for the sake of clarity, that we randomly split the sample into
two parts: a main part of size n, with observation numbers indexed by i ∈ I , and an auxiliary
part of size N − n, with observations indexed by i ∈ I c . For simplicity, we take n = N/2 for the
moment and we turn to more general cases that cover unequal split-sizes, using more than one
split, and achieving the same efficiency as if the full sample were used for estimating θ0 in the
formal development in Section 3. Suppose ĝ0 is obtained using the auxiliary sample and that,
given this ĝ0 , the final estimate of θ0 is obtained using the main sample:

The estimator θ̂0 will generally have a slower than 1/ n rate of convergence, namely,
√

| n(θ̂0 − θ0 )| → ∞.

(1.4)

As detailed below, the driving force behind this ‘inferior’ behaviour is the bias in learning g0 .
To heuristically illustrate the impact of the bias in learning g0 , we can decompose the scaled
estimation error in θ̂0 as

is the regularization bias term, which is not centred and diverges in general. Indeed, we have

m0 (Xi )(g0 (Xi ) − ĝ0 (Xi )) + oP (1)

n i∈I
to the first order. Heuristically, b is√ the sum of n terms that do not have mean zero,
m0 (Xi )(g0 (Xi ) − ĝ0 (Xi )), divided by n. These terms have non-zero mean because, in highdimensional or otherwise highly complex settings, we must employ regularized estimators –
such as lasso, ridge, boosting or penalized neural nets – for informative learning to be feasible.
The regularization in these estimators keeps the variance of the estimator from exploding but
also necessarily induces substantive biases in the estimator ĝ0 of g0 . Specifically, the rate of
convergence of (the bias of) ĝ0 to g0 in the root-mean-squared√error sense will typically be n−ϕg
with ϕg < 1/2. Hence, we expect b to be of stochastic order nn−ϕg → ∞ as Di is centred at
m0 (Xi ) = 0, which then implies (1.4).

functions of X. In other settings, we could, for example, use iterative methods that alternate between random forests, for
estimating g0 , and least squares, for estimating θ0 .

sample of observations. We are now solving an auxiliary prediction problem to estimate the
conditional mean of D given X, so we are doing ‘double prediction’ or ‘double machine
learning’.
After partialling the effect of X out from D and obtaining a preliminary estimate of g0 from
the auxiliary sample as before, we can formulate the following debiased ML (DML) estimator
for θ0 using the main sample of observations:3

By approximately orthogonalizing D with respect to X and approximately removing the direct
effect of confounding by subtracting an estimate of g0 , θ̌0 removes the effect of regularization
bias that contaminates (1.3). The formulation of θ̌0 also provides direct links to both the classical
econometric literature, as the estimator can clearly be interpreted as a linear instrumental variable
(IV) estimator, and to the more recent literature on debiased lasso in the context where g0 is taken
to be well approximated by a sparse linear combination of pre-specified functions of X; see, e.g.,
Belloni et al. (2013, 2014a,b), Javanmard and Montanari (2014b), van de Geer et al. (2014) and
Zhang and Zhang (2014).4
To illustrate the benefits of the auxiliary prediction step and the estimation of θ0 with θ̌0 , we
sketch the properties of θ̌0 here. We can decompose the scaled estimation error of θ̌0 into three
components:
√
n(θ̌0 − θ0 ) = a ∗ + b∗ + c∗ .
The leading term, a ∗ , will satisfy
1 
Vi Ui  N(0, )
a ∗ = (E[V 2 ])−1 √
n i∈I
under mild conditions. The second term, b∗ , captures the impact of regularization bias in
estimating g0 and m0 . Specifically, we will have
1 
(m̂0 (Xi ) − m0 (Xi ))(ĝ0 (Xi ) − g0 (Xi )),
b∗ = (E[V 2 ])−1 √
n i∈I
which now depends on the product of the estimation errors in m̂0 and ĝ0 . Because this term
depends only on the product of the estimation errors, it can vanish
under a broad range of data√
generating processes. Indeed, this term is upper-bounded by nn−(ϕm +ϕg ) , where n−ϕm and n−ϕg
are respectively the rates of convergence of m̂0 to m0 and ĝ0 to g0 ; this upper bound can clearly
vanish even though both m0 and g0 are estimated at relatively slow rates. Verifying that θ̌0 has
good properties then requires that the remainder term, c∗ , is sufficiently well behaved. Sample

orthogonalization to alleviate the impact of regularization bias on subsequent estimation and inference.

splitting will play a key role in allowing us to guarantee that c∗ = oP (1) under weak conditions
as outlined below and discussed in detail in Section 3.
Figure 1 provides a numerical illustration of the negative impact of regularization bias and
the benefit of orthogonalization. The left panel shows the behaviour of a conventional (nonorthogonal) ML estimator, θ̂0 , in the partially linear model in a simple simulation experiment
where we learn g0 using a random forest. The g0 in this experiment is a very smooth function of a
small number of variables, so the experiment is seemingly favourable to the use of random forests
a priori. The histogram shows the simulated distribution of the centred estimator, θ̂0 − θ0 . The
estimator is badly biased, shifted much to the right relative to the true value θ0 . The distribution
of the estimator (approximated by the blue histogram) is substantively different from a normal
approximation (shown by the red curve) derived under the assumption that the bias is negligible.
The right panel shows the behaviour of the orthogonal, DML estimator, θ̌0 , in the partially linear
model in a simple experiment where we learn nuisance functions using random forests. Note
that the simulated data are exactly the same as those underlying in the left panel. The simulated
distribution of the centred estimator, θ̌0 − θ0 (given by the blue histogram) illustrates that the
estimator is approximately unbiased, concentrates around θ0 , and is well approximated by the
normal approximation obtained in Section 3 (shown by the red curve).
The role of sample splitting in removing bias induced by overfitting. Our analysis makes use
of sample splitting, which plays a key role in establishing that remainder terms, such as c∗ ,
vanish in probability. In the partially linear model, we find that the remainder c∗ contains terms
such as
1 
Vi (ĝ0 (Xi ) − g0 (Xi )),
√
n i∈I

(1.6)

√
which involve 1/ n-normalized sums of products of structural unobservables from model (1.1)–
(1.2) with estimation errors in learning the nuisance functions g0 and m0 . The use of sample
splitting allows simple and tight control of such terms. To see this, assume that observations
are independent and recall that ĝ0 is estimated using only observations in the auxiliary sample.


V. Chernozhukov et al.

Then, conditioning on the auxiliary sample and recalling that E[Vi |Xi ] = 0, it is easy to verify
that term (1.6) has mean zero and variance of order
1
p
(ĝ0 (Xi ) − g0 (Xi ))2 → 0.
n i∈I
Thus, the term (1.6) vanishes in probability by Chebyshev’s inequality.
While sample splitting allows us to deal with remainder terms such as c∗ , its direct application
does have the drawback that the estimator of the parameter of interest only makes use of the main
sample, which can result in a substantial loss of efficiency as we are only making use of a subset
of the available data. However, we can flip the role of the main and auxiliary samples to obtain
a second version of the estimator of the parameter of interest. By averaging the two resulting
estimators, we can regain full efficiency. Indeed, the two estimators will be approximately
independent, so simply averaging them offers an efficient procedure. We call this sample-splitting
procedure – where we swap the roles of main and auxiliary samples to obtain multiple estimates
and then average the results – ‘cross-fitting’. We formally define this procedure and discuss a
K-fold version of cross-fitting in Section 3.
Without sample splitting, terms such as (1.6) might not vanish and can lead to poor
performance of estimators of θ0 . The difficulty arises because model errors, such as Vi , and
estimation errors, such as ĝ0 (Xi ) − g0 (Xi ), are generally related because the data for observation
i are used in forming the estimator ĝ0 . The association can then lead to poor performance of
an estimator of θ0 that makes use of ĝ0 as a plug-in estimator for g0 even when this estimator
converges at a very favourable rate, say N −1/2+ .
As an artificial but illustrative example of the problems that can result from overfitting, let
ĝ0 (Xi ) = g0 (Xi ) + (Yi − g0 (Xi ))/N 1/2− for any i in the sample used to form estimator ĝ0 , and
note that the second term provides a simple model that captures overfitting of the outcome
variable within the estimation sample. This estimator is excellent in terms of rates. If Ui and
Di are bounded, ĝ0 converges uniformly to g0 at the nearly parametric rate N −1/2+ . Despite this
fast rate of convergence, term c∗ now explodes if we do not use sample splitting. For example,
suppose that the full sample is used to estimate both ĝ0 and θ̌0 . A simple calculation then reveals
that term c∗ becomes
N

N i=1

This bias due to overfitting is illustrated in the left panel of Figure 2. The histogram in the
figure gives a simulated distribution for the studentized θ̌ resulting from using the full sample and
the contrived estimator ĝ(Xi ) given above. We can see that the histogram is shifted markedly to
the left demonstrating substantial bias resulting from overfitting. The right panel of Figure 2 also
illustrates that this bias is completely removed by sample splitting. The results in the right panel
of Figure 2 make use of the twofold cross-fitting procedure discussed above using the estimator
θ̌ and the contrived estimator ĝ(Xi ) exactly as in the left panel. The difference is that ĝ(Xi ) is
formed in one half of the sample and then θ̌ is estimated using the other half of the sample. This
procedure is then repeated, swapping the roles of the two samples, and the results are averaged.
We can see that the substantial bias from the full sample estimator has been removed and that the
spread of the histogram corresponding to the cross-fitting estimator is roughly the same as that
of the full sample estimator, clearly illustrating the bias-reduction property and efficiency of the
cross-fitting procedure.

A less contrived example that highlights the improvements brought by sample splitting is the
sparse high-dimensional IV model analysed in Belloni et al. (2012). Specifically, they consider
the IV model
Y = Dθ0 + ,
where E[|D] = 0 but instruments Z exist such that E[D|Z] is not a constant and E[|Z] =
0. Within this model, Belloni et al. (2012) focus on the problem of estimating the optimal
instrument, η0 (Z) = E[D|Z], using lasso-type methods. If η0 (Z) is approximately sparse in the
sense that only s terms of the dictionary of series transformations B(Z) = (B1 (Z), . . . , Bp (Z))
n to
are needed to approximate the function accurately, Belloni et al. (2012) require that s 2
establish their asymptotic results when sample splitting is not used. However, they show that
these results continue to hold under the much weaker requirement that s
n if one employs
sample splitting. We note that this example provides a prototypical example where Neyman
orthogonality holds and ML methods can usefully be adopted to aid in learning structural
parameters of interest. We also note that the weaker conditions required when using sample
splitting would also carry over to sparsity-based estimators in the partially linear model cited
above. We discuss this in more detail in Section 4.
While we find substantial appeal in using sample splitting, one can also use empirical
process methods to verify that biases introduced due to overfitting are negligible. For
example,
consider the problematic term in the partially linear model described previously,
√
(1/ n) i∈I Vi (ĝ0 (Xi ) − g0 (Xi )). This term is clearly bounded by
1 
sup √
Vi (g(Xi ) − g0 (Xi )) ,
n i∈I
g∈GN

(1.7)

where GN is the smallest class of functions that contains estimators of g0 , ĝ, with high probability.
In conventional semi-parametric statistical and econometric analysis, the complexity of GN is
controlled by invoking Donsker conditions, which allow verification that terms such as (1.7)
vanish asymptotically. Importantly, Donsker conditions require that GN has bounded complexity,


C8

V. Chernozhukov et al.

specifically a bounded entropy integral. Because of the latter property, Donsker conditions are
inappropriate in settings using ML methods where the dimension of X is modelled as increasing
with the sample size and estimators necessarily live in highly complex spaces. For example,
Donsker conditions rule out even the simplest linear parametric model with high-dimensional
regressors with parameter space given by the Euclidean ball with the unit radius:
GN = {x → g(x) = x θ ; θ ∈ RpN : θ  ≤ 1}.
The entropy of this model, as measured by the logarithm of the covering number, grows at the
rate pN . Without invoking Donsker conditions, one can still show that terms such as (1.7) vanish
as long as the entropy of GN does not increase with N too rapidly. A fairly general treatment is
given by Belloni et al. (2017) who provide a set of conditions under which terms, such as c∗ , can
vanish making use of the full sample. However, these conditions on the growth of entropy could
result in unnecessarily strong restrictions on model complexity, such as very strict requirements
on sparsity in the context of lasso estimation, as demonstrated in the IV example mentioned
above. Sample splitting allows one to obtain good results under very weak conditions.
Neyman orthogonality and moment conditions. Now we turn to a generalization of the
orthogonalization principle above. The first ‘conventional’ estimator θ̂0 given in (1.3) can be
viewed as a solution to estimating equations
1
ϕ(W ; θ̂0 , ĝ0 ) = 0,
n i∈I
where ϕ is a known score function and ĝ0 is the estimator of the nuisance parameter g0 . For
example, in the partially linear model above, the score function is ϕ(W ; θ, g) = (Y − θ D −
g(X))D. It is easy to see that this score function ϕ is sensitive to biased estimation of g.
Specifically, the Gateaux derivative operator with respect to g does not vanish:5
∂g E[ϕ(W ; θ0 , g0 )][g − g0 ] = 0.
The proofs of the general results in Section 3 show that this term’s vanishing is a key to
establishing good behaviour of an estimator for θ0 .
By contrast, the orthogonalized or double/debiased ML estimator θ̌0 given in (1.5) solves
1
ψ(W ; θ̌0 , η̂0 ) = 0,
n i∈I
where η̂0 is the estimator of the nuisance parameter η0 and ψ is an orthogonalized or debiased
score function that satisfies the property that the Gateaux derivative operator with respect to η
vanishes when evaluated at the true parameter values:
∂η E[ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )][η − η0 ] = 0.

(1.8)

We refer to property (1.8) as Neyman orthogonality and to ψ as the Neyman orthogonal score
function due to the fundamental contributions in Neyman (1959, 1979), where this notion was
introduced. Intuitively, the Neyman orthogonality condition means that the moment conditions
used to identify θ0 are locally insensitive to the value of the nuisance parameter, which allows one
5

to plug in noisy estimates of these parameters without strongly violating the moment condition.
In the partially linear model (1.1)–(1.2), the estimator θ̌0 uses the score function ψ(W ; θ, η) =
(Y − Dα − g(X))(D − m(X)), with the nuisance parameter being η = (m, g). It is easy to see
that these score functions ψ are not sensitive to biased estimation of η0 in the sense that (1.8)
holds. The proofs of the general results in Section 3 show that this property and sample splitting
are two generic keys that allow us to establish good behaviour of an estimator for θ0 .
Literature overview
Our paper builds upon two important bodies
√ of research within the semi-parametric literature.
The first is the literature on obtaining N-consistent and asymptotically normal estimates
of low-dimensional objects in the presence of high-dimensional or non-parametric nuisance
functions. The second is the literature on the use of sample splitting to relax entropy conditions.
We provide links to each of these bodies of literature in turn.
The problem we study is obviously √related to the classical semi-parametric estimation
framework, which focuses on obtaining N-consistent and asymptotically normal estimates
for low-dimensional components with nuisance parameters estimated by conventional nonparametric estimators, such as kernels or series. See, for example, the work by Levit (1975),
Ibragimov and Hasminskii (1981), Bickel (1982), Robinson (1988), Newey (1990, 1994), van der
Vaart (1991), Andrews (1994a), Newey et al. (1998, 2004), Robins and Rotnitzky (1995), Linton
(1996), Bickel et al. (1998), Chen et al. (2003), van der Laan and Rose (2011) and Ai and Chen
(2012). Neyman orthogonality (1.8), introduced by Neyman (1959), plays a key role in optimal
testing theory and adaptive estimation, semi-parametric learning theory and econometrics, and,
more recently, targeted learning theory. For example, Andrews (1994a), Newey (1994) and
van der Vaart (1998) provide a general set of results on estimation of a low-dimensional
parameter θ0 in the presence of nuisance parameters η0 . Andrews (1994a) uses Neyman
orthogonality (1.8) and Donsker conditions to demonstrate the key equicontinuity condition

which reduces to (1.6) in the PLR model. Newey (1994) gives conditions on estimating
equations and nuisance function estimators so that nuisance function estimators do not affect the
limiting distribution of parameters of interest, providing a semi-parametric version of Neyman
orthogonality. van der Vaart (1998) discusses use of semi-parametrically efficient scores to
define estimators that solve estimating equations, setting averages of efficient scores to zero.
He also uses efficient scores to define k-step estimators, where a preliminary estimator is used
to estimate the efficient score and then updating is done to further improve estimation; see also
comments below on the use of sample splitting.
There is also a related targeted maximum likelihood learning approach, introduced in
Scharfstein et al. (1999) in the context of treatments effects analysis. This is substantially
generalized by van der Laan and Rubin (2006), who use maximum likelihood in a least favourable
direction and then perform one-step or k-step updates using the estimated scores, in an effort
to better estimate the target parameter.6 This procedure is like the least favourable direction
6 Targeted minimum loss estimation, which shares similar properties, is also discussed in, e.g., van der Laan and Rose
(2011) and van der Laan (2015).

approach in semi-parametrics; see, for example, Severini and Wong (1992). The introduction
of the likelihood introduces major benefits, such as allowing simple and natural imposition of
constraints inherent in the data (e.g. support restrictions when the outcome is binary or censored)
and permitting the use of likelihood cross-validation to choose the nuisance parameter estimator.
This data adaptive choice of the nuisance parameter has been dubbed the ‘super learner’ by
van der Laan et al. (2007). In subsequent work, van der Laan and Rose (2011) emphasize the use
of ML methods to estimate the nuisance parameters for use with the super learner. Much of this
work, including recent work such as Luedtke and van der Laan (2016), Toth and van der Laan
(2016) and Zheng et al. (2016), focuses on formal results under a Donsker condition, though the
use of sample splitting to relax these conditions has also been advocated in the targeted maximum
likelihood setting, as discussed below.
The Donsker condition is a powerful classical condition that allows rich structures for fixed
function classes G, but unfortunately it is unsuitable for high-dimensional settings. Examples
of function classes where a Donsker condition holds include functions of a single variable that
have total variation bounded by 1 and functions x → f (x) that have r > dim(x)/2 uniformly
bounded derivatives. As a further example, functions composed from function classes with VC
dimensions bounded by p through a fixed number of algebraic and monotonic transforms are
Donsker. However, this property will no longer hold if we let dim(x) grow to infinity with the
sample size as this increase in dimension would require that the VC dimension also increases
with n. More generally, Donsker conditions are easily violated once dimensions become large.
A major point of departure of the present work from the classical literature on semi-parametric
estimation is its explicit focus on high-complexity/entropy cases. One way to analyse the problem
of estimation in high-entropy cases is to see to what degree equicontinuity results continue to hold
while allowing moderate growth of the complexity/entropy of GN . Examples of papers taking this
approach in approximately sparse settings are Belloni et al. (2014b, 2016, 2017), Chernozhukov
et al. (2015b), Javanmard and Montanari (2014a), van de Geer et al. (2014) and Zhang and Zhang
(2014). In all of these examples, entropy growth must be limited in what can be very restrictive
ways. The entropy conditions rule out the contrived overfitting example mentioned above, which
does approximate realistic examples, and might otherwise place severe restrictions on the model.
For example,
in Belloni et al. (2010, 2012), the optimal instrument needs to be sparse of order
√
n.
s
A key device that we use to avoid strong entropy conditions is cross-fitting via sample
splitting. Cross-fitting is a practical, efficient form of data splitting. Importantly, its use here is not
simply as a device to make proofs elementary (which it does), but as a practical method to allow
us to overcome the overfitting/high-complexity phenomena that commonly arise in data analysis
based on highly adaptive ML methods. Our treatment builds upon the sample-splitting ideas
employed in Belloni et al. (2010, 2012) who considered sample splitting in a high-dimensional
sparse optimal IV model to weaken the sparsity condition mentioned in the previous paragraph
to s
n. This work, in turn, was inspired by Angrist and Krueger (1995). We also build on
Ayyagari (2010) and Robins et al. (2013), where ML methods and sample splitting were used in
the estimation of a partially linear model of the effects of pollution while controlling for several
covariates. We use the term cross-fitting to characterize our recommended procedure, partly
borrowing the jargon from Fan et al. (2012), who employed a slightly different form of sample
splitting to estimate the scale parameter in a high-dimensional sparse regression. Of course,
the use of sample splitting to relax entropy conditions has a long history in semi-parametric
estimation problems. For example, Bickel (1982) considered estimating nuisance functions using
a vanishing fraction of the sample, and these results were extended to sample splitting into two

equal halves and discretization of the parameter space by Schick (1986). Similarly, van der
Vaart (1998) uses two-way sample splitting and discretization of the parameter space to give
weak conditions for k-step estimators using the efficient scores where sample splitting is used
to estimate the updates; see also Hubbard et al. (2016). Robins et al. (2008, 2017) use sample
splitting in the construction of higher-order influence function corrections in semi-parametric
estimation. Some recent work in the targeted maximum likelihood literature, e.g. Zheng and
van der Laan (2011), also notes the utility of sample splitting in the context of k-step updating,
though this sample splitting approach is different from the cross-fitting approach we pursue.
Plan of the paper. We organize the rest of the paper as follows. In Section 2, we formally
define Neyman orthogonality and provide a brief discussion that synthesizes various models
and frameworks that can be used to produce estimating equations satisfying this key condition.
In Section 3, we carefully define DML estimators and develop their general theory. We then
illustrate this general theory by applying it to provide theoretical results for using DML to
estimate and carry out inference for key parameters in the PLR model, and for using DML to
estimate and carry out inference for coefficients on endogenous variables in a partially linear
IV model in Section 4. In Section 5, we provide a further illustration of the general theory by
applying it to develop theoretical results for DML estimation and inference for average treatment
effects (ATEs) and average treatment effects on the treated (ATTEs) under unconfoundedness,
and for DML estimation of local average treatment effects (LATEs) in an IV context within the
potential outcomes framework; see Imbens and Rubin (2015). Finally, we apply DML in three
empirical illustrations in Section 6. In the Appendix, we define additional notation and present
proofs.
Notation. The symbols Pr and E denote probability and expectation operators with respect
to a generic probability measure that describes the law of the data. If we need to signify the
dependence on a probability measure P , we use P as a subscript in PrP and EP . We use
capital letters, such as W , to denote random elements and we use the corresponding lowercase
letters, such as w, to denote fixed values that these random elements can take. In what follows,
denote the Lq (P ) norm; for example, we denote f P ,q := f (W )P ,q :=
we
 use  q· P ,q to 1/q
( |f (w)| dP (w)) . We use x to denote the transpose of a column vector x. For a differentiable
map x → f (x), mapping Rd to Rk , we use ∂x f to abbreviate the partial derivatives (∂/∂x )f ,
and we correspondingly use the expression ∂x f (x0 ) to mean ∂x f (x) |x=x0 , etc.

2. CONSTRUCTION OF NEYMAN ORTHOGONAL SCORE/MOMENT
FUNCTIONS
Here we formally introduce the model and we discuss several methods for generating orthogonal
scores in a wide variety of settings, including the classical Neyman construction. We also use
this as an opportunity to synthesize some recent developments in the literature.
2.1. Moment condition/estimating equation framework
We are interested in the true value θ0 of the low-dimensional target parameter θ ∈ , where
a non-empty measurable subset of Rdθ . We assume that θ0 satisfies the moment conditions

where ψ = (ψ1 , . . . , ψdθ ) is a vector of known score functions, W is a random element taking
values in a measurable space (W, AW ) with law determined by a probability measure P ∈ PN ,
and η0 is the true value of the nuisance parameter η ∈ T , where T is a convex subset of some
normed vector space with the norm denoted by  · T . We assume that the score functions ψj :
W × × T → R are measurable once we equip
and T with their Borel σ -fields, and we

the
distribution
of W is available for estimation and
assume that a random sample (Wi )N

inference.
As discussed in Section 1, we require the Neyman orthogonality condition for the score ψ.
To introduce the condition, for T = {η − η0 : η ∈ T } we define the pathwise (or the Gateaux)
derivative map Dr : T → Rdθ ,
Dr [η − η0 ] := ∂r {EP [ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 + r(η − η0 )]},

η ∈ T,

for all r ∈ [0, 1), which we assume to exist. For convenience, we also denote
∂η EP [ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )][η − η0 ] := D0 [η − η0 ],

η ∈ T.

(2.2)

Note that ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 + r(η − η0 )) here is well defined because for all r ∈ [0, 1) and η ∈ T ,
η0 + r(η − η0 ) = (1 − r)η0 + rη ∈ T ,
as T is a convex set. In addition, let TN ⊂ T be a nuisance realization set such that the estimators
η̂0 of η0 specified below take values in this set with high probability. In practice, we typically
assume that TN is a properly shrinking neighbourhood of η0 . Note that TN − η0 is the nuisance
deviation set, which contains deviations of η̂0 from η0 , η̂0 − η0 , with high probability. The
Neyman orthogonality condition requires that the derivative in (2.2) vanishes for all η ∈ TN .
D EFINITION 2.1. (N EYMAN ORTHOGONALITY) The score ψ = (ψ1 , . . . , ψdθ ) obeys the
orthogonality condition at (θ0 , η0 ) with respect to the nuisance realization set TN ⊂ T if (2.1)
holds and the pathwise derivative map Dr [η − η0 ] exists for all r ∈ [0, 1) and η ∈ TN and
vanishes at r = 0; namely,
∂η EP [ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )][η − η0 ] = 0,

for all η ∈ TN .

(2.3)

We remark here that condition (2.3) holds with TN = T when η is a finite-dimensional vector
as long as ∂η EP [ψj (W ; θ0 , η0 )] = 0 for all j = 1, . . . , dθ , where ∂η EP [ψj (W ; θ0 , η0 )] denotes
the vector of partial derivatives of the function η → EP [ψj (W ; θ0 , η)] for η = η0 .
Sometimes it will also be helpful to use an approximate Neyman orthogonality condition as
opposed to the exact one given in Definition 2.1.
D EFINITION 2.2. (N EYMAN NEAR-ORTHOGONALITY) The score ψ = (ψ1 , . . . , ψdθ ) obeys the
λN near-orthogonality condition at (θ0 , η0 ) with respect to the nuisance realization set TN ⊂ T
if (2.1) holds and the pathwise derivative map Dr [η − η0 ] exists for all r ∈ [0, 1) and η ∈ TN
and is small at r = 0; namely,
∂η EP [ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )][η − η0 ] ≤ λN ,

for all η ∈ TN ,

2.2. Construction of Neyman orthogonal scores
If we start with a score ϕ that does not satisfy the orthogonality condition above, we first
transform it into a score ψ that does. Here we outline several methods for doing so.
2.2.1. Neyman orthogonal scores for likelihood and other M-estimation problems with finitedimensional nuisance parameters. First, we describe the construction used by Neyman (1959)
to derive his celebrated orthogonal score and C(α)-statistic in a maximum likelihood setting.7
Such a construction also underlies the concept of local unbiasedness in the construction of
optimal tests in, e.g., Ferguson (1967), and it was extended to non-likelihood settings by
Wooldridge (1991). The discussion of Neyman’s construction here draws on Chernozhukov et al.
(2015a).
To describe the construction, let θ ∈ ⊂ Rdθ and β ∈ B ⊂ Rdβ , where B is a convex set,
be the target and the nuisance parameters, respectively. Further, suppose that the true parameter
values θ0 and β0 solve the optimization problem
max EP [(W ; θ, β)],

(2.5)

θ∈ , β∈B

where (W ; θ, β) is a known criterion function. For example, (W ; θ, β) can be the log-likelihood
function associated with observation W . More generally, we refer to (W ; θ, β) as the quasi-loglikelihood function. Then, under mild regularity conditions, θ0 and β0 satisfy
EP [∂θ (W ; θ0 , β0 )] = 0,

EP [∂β (W ; θ0 , β0 )] = 0.

(2.6)

Note that the original score function ϕ(W ; θ, β) = ∂θ (W ; θ, β) for estimating θ0 will not
generally satisfy the orthogonality condition. Now consider the new score function, which we
refer to as the Neyman orthogonal score,
ψ(W ; θ, η) = ∂θ (W ; θ, β) − μ∂β (W ; θ, β),

(2.7)

where the nuisance parameter is
η = (β , vec(μ) ) ∈ T = B × Rdθ dβ ⊂ Rp ,

p = dβ + dθ dβ ,

and μ is the dθ × dβ orthogonalization parameter matrix whose true value μ0 solves the equation
Jθβ − μJββ = 0

(2.8)

for
J =

Jθθ
Jβθ

Jθβ
Jββ

= ∂(θ ,β ) EP [∂(θ ,β ) (W ; θ, β)]|θ=θ0 ; β=β0 .

The true value of the nuisance parameter η is
η0 = (β0 , vec(μ0 ) ) ;

(2.9)

7 The C(α)-statistic, or the orthogonal score statistic, has been explicitly used for testing and estimation in highdimensional sparse models in Belloni et al. (2015).

and when Jββ is invertible, (2.8) has the unique solution,
−1
.
μ0 = Jθβ Jββ

(2.10)

The following lemma shows that the score ψ in (2.7) satisfies the Neyman orthogonality
condition.
L EMMA 2.1. (N EYMAN ORTHOGONAL SCORES FOR QUASI-LIKELIHOOD SETTINGS) If (2.6)
holds, J exists, and Jββ is invertible, then the score ψ in (2.7) is Neyman orthogonal at (θ0 , η0 )
with respect to the nuisance realization set TN = T .
R EMARK 2.1. (A DDITIONAL NUISANCE PARAMETERS) Note that the orthogonal score ψ in
(2.7) has nuisance parameters consisting of the elements of μ in addition to the elements of β,
and Lemma 2.1 shows that Neyman orthogonality holds both with respect to β and with respect
to μ. We will find that Neyman orthogonal scores in other settings, including infinite-dimensional
ones, have a similar property.
R EMARK 2.2. (E FFICIENCY) Note that in this example, μ0 not only creates the necessary
orthogonality but also creates the efficient score for inference on the target parameter θ when the
quasi-log-likelihood function is the true (possibly conditional) log-likelihood, as demonstrated
by Neyman (1959).
E XAMPLE 2.1. (H IGH-DIMENSIONAL LINEAR REGRESSION) As an application of the
construction above, consider the following linear predictive model,
Y = Dθ0 + X β0 + U,
D = X γ0 + V ,

EP [U (X , D) ] = 0,

(2.11)

EP [V X] = 0,

(2.12)

where, for simplicity, we assume that θ0 is a scalar. The first equation here is the main predictive
model, and the second equation only plays a role in the construction of the Neyman orthogonal
scores. It is well known that θ0 and β0 in this model solve the optimization problem (2.5) with
(W ; θ, β) = −

(Y − Dθ − X β)2
,
2

θ∈

= R, β ∈ B = Rdβ ,

where we denote W = (Y, D, X ) . Hence, equations (2.6) hold with
∂θ (W ; θ, β) = (Y − Dθ − X β)D,

∂β (W ; θ, β) = (Y − Dθ − X β)X,

and the matrix J satisfies
Jθβ = −EP [DX ],

Jββ = −EP [XX ].

The Neyman orthogonal score is then given by
ψ(W ; θ, η) = (Y − Dθ − X β)(D − μX);
ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 ) = U (D − μ0 X);

η = (β , vec(μ) ) ;

μ0 = EP [DX ](EP [XX ])−1 = γ0 .

(2.13)

If the vector of covariates X here is high-dimensional but the vectors of parameters β0 and γ0 are
approximately sparse, we can use 1 -penalized least-squares, 2 -boosting, or forward selection
methods to estimate β0 and γ0 = μ0 , and hence μ0 = (β0 , vec(μ0 ) ) ; see references cited in
Section 1.

Double/debiased machine learning

If Jββ is not invertible, (2.8) typically has multiple solutions. In this case, it is convenient to
focus on a minimal norm solution,
μ0 = arg min μ such that Jθβ − μJββ q = 0
for a suitably chosen norm  · q on the space of dθ × dβ matrices. With an eye on solving the
empirical version of this problem, we can also consider the relaxed version of this problem,
μ0 = arg min μ such that Jθβ − μJββ q ≤ rN

(2.14)

for some rN > 0 such that rN → 0 as N → ∞. This relaxation is also helpful when Jββ is
invertible but ill-conditioned. The following lemma shows that using μ0 in (2.14) leads to
Neyman near-orthogonal scores. The proof of this lemma can be found in the Appendix.
L EMMA 2.2. (N EYMAN NEAR-ORTHOGONAL SCORES FOR QUASI-LIKELIHOOD SETTINGS) If
(2.6) holds, J exists, the solution of the optimization problem (2.14) exists, and μ0 is taken to
be this solution, then the score ψ defined in (2.7) is Neyman λN near-orthogonal at (θ0 , η0 ) with
respect to the nuisance realization set TN = {β ∈ B : β − β0 ∗q ≤ λN /rN } × Rdθ dβ , where the
norm  · ∗q on Rdβ is defined by β∗q = supA Aβ with the supremum being taken over all
dθ × dβ matrices A such that Aq ≤ 1.
E XAMPLE 2.1. (C ONTINUED) In the high-dimensional linear regression example above, the
relaxation (2.14) is helpful when Jββ = EP [XX ] is ill-conditioned. Specifically, if one suspects
that EP [XX ] is ill-conditioned, one can define μ0 as the solution to the following optimization
problem:
min μ such that EP [DX ] − μEP [XX ]∞ ≤ rN .

(2.15)

Lemma 2.2 then shows that using this μ0 leads to a score ψ that obeys the Neyman nearorthogonality condition. Alternatively, one can define μ0 as the solution of the following closely
related optimization problem,
min(μEP [XX ]μ − μEP [DX] + rN μ1 ),
μ

whose solution also obeys EP [DX] − μEP [XX ]∞ ≤ rN , which follows from the first-order
conditions. An empirical version of either problem leads to a Lasso-type estimator of the
regularized solution μ0 ; see Javanmard and Montanari (2014a).
R EMARK 2.3. (G IVING UP EFFICIENCY) Note that the regularized μ0 in (2.14) creates the
necessary near-orthogonality at the cost of giving up somewhat on the efficiency of the score
ψ. At the same time, regularization may generate additional robustness gains as achieving full
efficiency by estimating μ0 in (2.10) may require stronger conditions.
R EMARK 2.4. (C ONCENTRATING-OUT APPROACH) The approach for constructing Neyman
orthogonal scores described above is closely related to the following concentrating-out approach,
which has been used, for example, in Newey (1994), to show Neyman orthogonality when β is
infinite dimensional. For all θ ∈ , let βθ be the solution of the following optimization problem:
max EP [(W ; θ, β)].

Under mild regularity conditions, βθ satisfies

(2.16)

C16

V. Chernozhukov et al.

Differentiating (2.16) with respect to θ and interchanging the order of differentiation gives
0 = ∂θ ∂β EP [(W ; θ, βθ )] = ∂β ∂θ EP [(W ; θ, βθ )]
= ∂β EP [∂θ (W ; θ, βθ ) + [∂θ βθ ] ∂β (W ; θ, βθ )]
= ∂β EP [ψ(W ; θ, β, ∂θ βθ )]|β=βθ ,
where we denote
ψ(W ; θ, β, ∂θ βθ ) := ∂θ (W ; θ, β) + [∂θ βθ ] ∂β (W ; θ, β).
This vector of functions is a score with nuisance parameters η = (β , vec(∂θ βθ )) . As before,
additional nuisance parameters, ∂θ βθ in this case, are introduced when the orthogonal score
is formed. Evaluating these equations at θ0 and β0 , it follows from the previous equation that
ψ(W ; θ, β, ∂θ βθ ) is orthogonal with respect to β and from EP [∂β (W ; θ0 , β0 )] = 0 that we
have orthogonality with respect to ∂θ βθ . Thus, maximizing the expected objective function
with respect to the nuisance parameters, plugging that maximum back in, and differentiating
with respect to the parameters of interest produces an orthogonal moment condition. See also
Section 2.2.3.
2.2.2. Neyman orthogonal scores in generalized method of moments problems. The
construction in the previous section gives a Neyman orthogonal score whenever the moment
conditions (2.6) hold, and, as discussed in Remark 2.2, the resulting score is efficient as long as
(W ; θ, β) is the log-likelihood function. The question, however, remains about constructing the
efficient score when (W ; θ, β) is not necessarily a log-likelihood function. In this section, we
answer this question and describe a generalized method of moments (GMM)-based method of
constructing an efficient and Neyman orthogonal score in this more general case. The discussion
here is related to Lee (2005), Bera et al. (2010) and Chernozhukov et al. (2015b).
Because GMM does not require that the moment conditions (2.6) are obtained from the firstorder conditions of the optimization problem (2.5), we use a different notation for the moment
conditions. Specifically, we consider parameters θ ∈ ⊂ Rdθ and β ∈ B ⊂ Rdβ , where B is a
convex set, whose true values, θ0 and β0 , solve the moment conditions
EP [m(W ; θ0 , β0 )] = 0,

(2.17)

where m : W × × B → R is a known vector-valued function, and dm ≥ dθ + dβ is the
number of moment conditions. In this case, a Neyman orthogonal score function is
dm

ψ(W ; θ, η) = μm(W ; θ, β),

(2.18)

where the nuisance parameter is
η = (β , vec(μ) ) ∈ T = B × Rdθ dm ⊂ Rp ,

p = dβ + dθ dm ,

and μ is the dθ × dm orthogonalization parameter matrix whose true value is
μ0 = (A −1 − A −1 Gβ (Gβ −1 Gβ )−1 Gβ −1 ).
Here
Gγ = ∂γ EP [m(W ; θ, β)]|γ =γ0

for γ = (θ , β ) and γ0 = (θ0 , β0 ) , A is a dm × dθ moment selection matrix,  is a dm × dm
positive definite weighting matrix, and both A and  can be chosen arbitrarily. Note that setting
A = Gθ and  = VarP (m(W ; θ0 , β0 )]) = EP [m(W ; θ0 , β0 )m(W ; θ0 , β0 ) ]
leads to the efficient score in the sense of yielding an estimator of θ0 having the smallest variance
in the class of GMM estimators (Hansen, 1982), and, in fact, to the semi-parametrically efficient
score; see Levit (1975), Nevelson (1977) and Chamberlain (1987). Let η0 = (β0 , vec(μ0 ) ) be
the true value of the nuisance parameter η = (β , vec(μ) ) . The following lemma shows that the
score ψ in (2.18) satisfies the Neyman orthogonality condition.
L EMMA 2.3. (N EYMAN ORTHOGONAL SCORES FOR GMM SETTINGS) If (2.17) holds, Gγ
exists and  is invertible, then the score ψ in (2.18) is Neyman orthogonal at (θ0 , η0 ) with
respect to the nuisance realization set TN = T .
As in the quasi-likelihood case, we can also consider near-orthogonal scores. Specifically,
note that one of the orthogonality conditions that the score ψ in (2.18) has to satisfy is that
μ0 Gβ = 0, which can be rewritten as
A −1/2 (I − L(L L)−1 L )L = 0,
where L = −1/2 Gβ . Here, the part A −1/2 L(L L)−1 L can be expressed as γ0 L , where γ0 =
A −1/2 L(L L)−1 solves the optimization problem
min γ o such that A −1/2 L − γ L L∞ = 0,
for a suitably chosen norm  · o . When L L is close to being singular, this problem can be
relaxed:
min γ o such that A −1/2 L − γ L L∞ ≤ rN .

(2.19)

This relaxation leads to Neyman near-orthogonal scores.
L EMMA 2.4. (N EYMAN NEAR-ORTHOGONAL SCORES FOR GMM SETTINGS) In the set-up
above, with γ0 denoting the solution of (2.19), we have for μ0 := A −1 − γ0 L −1/2 and η0 =
(β0 , vec(μ0 ) ) that ψ defined in (2.18) is the Neyman λN near-orthogonal score at (θ0 , η0 ) with
respect to the nuisance realization set TN = {β ∈ B : β − β0 1 ≤ λN /rN } × Rdθ dm .
2.2.3. Neyman orthogonal scores for likelihood and other M-estimation problems with
infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters. Here we show that the concentrating-out approach
described in Remark 2.4 for the case of finite-dimensional nuisance parameters can be extended
to the case of infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters. Let (W ; θ, β) be a known criterion
function, where θ and β are the target and the nuisance parameters taking values in and B,
respectively, and let us assume that the true values of these parameters, θ0 and β0 , solve the
optimization problem (2.5). The function (W ; θ, β) is analogous to that discussed above but
now, instead of assuming that B is a (convex) subset of a finite-dimensional space, we assume
that B is some (convex) set of functions, so that β is the functional nuisance parameter. For
example, (W ; θ, β) could be a semi-parametric log-likelihood where β is the non-parametric
part of the model. More generally, (W ; θ, β) could be some other criterion function such as the
negative of a squared residual. Also, let
βθ = arg max EP [(W ; θ, β)]
β∈B

be the concentrated-out non-parametric part of the model. Note that βθ is a function-valued
function. Now consider the score function
ψ(W ; θ, η) =
where the nuisance parameter is η :

d(W ; θ, η(θ ))
,
dθ

(2.21)

→ B, and its true value η0 is given by

η0 (θ ) = βθ ,

for all θ ∈

.

Here, the symbol d/dθ denotes the full derivative with respect to θ , so that we differentiate with
respect to both θ arguments in (W ; θ, η(θ )). The following lemma shows that the score ψ in
(2.21) satisfies the Neyman orthogonality condition.
L EMMA 2.5. (N EYMAN ORTHOGONAL SCORES VIA CONCENTRATING-OUT APPROACH)
Suppose that (2.5) holds, and let T be a convex set of functions mapping
into B such that
η0 ∈ T . Also, suppose that for each η ∈ T , the function θ → (W ; θ, η(θ )) is continuously
differentiable almost surely. Then, under mild regularity conditions, the score ψ in (2.21) is
Neyman orthogonal at (θ0 , η0 ) with respect to the nuisance realization set TN = T .
As an example, consider the partially linear model from Section 1. Let
1
(W ; θ, β) = − (Y − Dθ − β(X))2 ,
2
and let B be the set of functions of X with finite mean square. Then
(θ0 , β0 ) = arg max EP [(W ; θ, β)]
θ∈ ,β∈B

and
βθ (X) = EP [Y − Dθ |X],

θ∈

.

Hence, (2.21) gives the following Neyman orthogonal score
1 d{Y − Dθ − EP [Y − Dθ |X]}2
2
dθ
= (D − EP [D|X]) × (Y − EP [Y |X] − (D − EP [D|X])θ )

ψ(W ; θ, βθ ) = −

= (D − m0 (X)) × (Y − Dθ − g0 (X)),
which corresponds to the estimator θ0 described in Section 1 in (1.5).
It is important to note that the concentrating-out approach described here gives a Neyman
orthogonal score without requiring that (W ; θ, β) is the log-likelihood function. Except for the
technical conditions needed to ensure the existence of derivatives and their interchangeability,
the only condition that is required is that θ0 and β0 solve the optimization problem (2.5). If
(W ; θ, β) is the log-likelihood function, however, it follows from Newey (1994, p. 1359),
that the concentrating-out approach actually yields the efficient score. An alternative, but
closely related, approach to derive the efficient score in the likelihood setting would be to
apply Neyman’s construction described above for a one-dimensional least favourable parametric
submodel; see Severini and Wong (1992) and Chapter 25 of van der Vaart (1998).

R EMARK 2.5. (G ENERATING ORTHOGONAL SCORES BY VARYING B) When we calculate the
concentrated-out non-parametric part βθ , we can use some other set of functions ϒ instead of B
on the right-hand side of (2.20):
βθ = arg max EP [(W ; θ, β)].
β∈ϒ

By replacing B by ϒ, we can generate a different Neyman orthogonal score. Of course, this
replacement might also change the true value θ0 of the parameter of interest, which is an
important consideration for the selection of ϒ. For example, consider the partially linear model
and assume that X has two components, X1 and X2 . Now, consider what would happen if we
replaced B, which is the set of functions of X with finite mean square, by the set of functions ϒ
that is the mean square closure of functions that are additive in X1 and X2 :
ϒ = {h(X1 ) + h(X2 )}.
Let ĒP denote the least-squares projection on ϒ. Then, applying the previous calculation with
ĒP replacing EP gives
ψ(W ; θ, βθ ) = (D − ĒP [D|X]) × (Y − ĒP [Y |X] + (D − ĒP [D|X])θ ),
which provides an orthogonal score based on additive function of X1 and X2 . Here, it is important
to note that the solution to EP [ψ(W, θ, βθ )] = 0 will be the true θ0 only when the true function of
X in the partially linear model is additive. More generally, the solution of the moment condition
would be the coefficient of D in the least-squares projection of Y on functions of the form
Dθ + h1 (X1 ) + h1 (X2 ). Note, though, that the corresponding score is orthogonal by virtue of
additivity being imposed in the estimation of ĒP [Y |X] and ĒP [D|X].
2.2.4. Neyman orthogonal scores for conditional moment restriction problems with infinitedimensional nuisance parameters. Next we consider the conditional moment restrictions
framework studied in Chamberlain (1992). To define the framework, let W , R and Z be random
vectors taking values in W ⊂ Rdw , R ⊂ Rdr and Z ⊂ Rdz , respectively. Assume that Z is a
subvector of R and R is a subvector of W , so that dz ≤ dr ≤ dw . Also, let θ ∈ ⊂ Rdθ be
a finite-dimensional parameter whose true value θ0 is of interest, and let h be a vector-valued
functional nuisance parameter taking values in a convex set of functions H mapping Z to Rdh ,
with the true value of h being h0 . The conditional moment restrictions framework assumes that
θ0 and h0 satisfy the moment conditions
EP [m(W ; θ0 , h0 (Z)) | R] = 0,

(2.22)

where m : W × × Rdh → Rdm is a known vector-valued function. This framework is of
interest because it covers a rich variety of models without having to explicitly rely on the
likelihood formulation.
To build a Neyman orthogonal score ψ(W ; θ, η) for estimating θ0 , consider the matrix-valued
functional parameter μ : R → Rdθ ×dm whose true value is given by
μ0 (R) = A(R) (R)−1 − G(Z)(R) (R)−1 ,

where the moment selection matrix-valued function A : R → Rdm ×dθ and the weighting positive
definite matrix-valued function  : R → Rdm ×dm can be chosen arbitrarily, and the matrix-valued
functions  : R → Rdm ×dθ and G : Z → Rdθ ×dm are given by
(R) = ∂v EP [m(W ; θ0 , v) | R]|v=h0 (Z)

(2.24)

G(Z) = EP [A(R) (R)−1 (R) | Z] × (EP [(R) (R)−1 (R) | Z])−1 .

(2.25)

and

Note that μ0 in (2.23) is well defined even though the right-hand side of (2.23) contains both R
and Z as Z is a subvector of R. Then a Neyman orthogonal score is
ψ(W ; θ, η) = μ(R)m(W ; θ, h(Z)),

(2.26)

where the nuisance parameter is
η = (μ, h) ∈ T = L1 (R; Rdθ ×dm ) × H.
Here, L1 (R; Rdθ ×dm ) is the vector space of matrix-valued functions f : R → Rdθ ×dm satisfying
EP [f (R)] < ∞. Also, note that even though the matrix-valued functions A and  can be
chosen arbitrarily, setting
A(R) = ∂θ EP [m(W ; θ, h0 (Z)) | R]|θ=θ0

(2.27)

(R) = EP [m(W ; θ0 , h0 (Z))m(W ; θ0 , h0 (Z)) | R]

(2.28)

and

leads to an asymptotic variance equal to the semi-parametric bound of Chamberlain (1992).
Let η0 = (μ0 , h0 ) be the true value of the nuisance parameter η = (μ, h). The following lemma
shows that the score ψ in (2.26) satisfies the Neyman orthogonality condition.
L EMMA 2.6. (N EYMAN O RTHOGONAL S CORES FOR C ONDITIONAL M OMENT S ETTINGS)
Suppose that (a) (2.22) holds, (b) the matrices EP [(R)4 ], EP [G(Z)4 ], EP [A(R)2 ]
and EP [(R)−2 ] are finite, and (c) for all h ∈ H, there exists a constant Ch > 0 such that
P r P (EP [m(W ; θ0 , h(Z)) | R] ≤ Ch ) = 1. Then the score ψ in (2.26) is Neyman orthogonal
at (θ0 , η0 ) with respect to the nuisance realization set TN = T .
As an application of the conditional moment restrictions framework, let us derive Neyman
orthogonal scores in the PLR example using this framework. The PLR model (1.1) is
equivalent to
EP [Y − Dθ0 − g0 (X) | X, D] = 0,
which can be written in the form of the conditional moment restrictions framework (2.22) with
W = (Y, D, X ) , R = (D, X ) , Z = X, h(Z) = g(X) and m(W ; θ, v) = Y − Dθ − v. Hence,
using (2.27) and (2.28) and denoting σ (D, X)2 = EP [U 2 | D, X] for U = Y − Dθ0 − g0 (X),
we can take
A(R) = −D,

(R) = EP [U 2 | D, X] = σ (D, X)2 .

With this choice of A(R) and (R), we have

By construction, the score ψ above is efficient and Neyman orthogonal. Note, however, that
using this score would require estimating the heteroscedasticity function σ (D, X)2 , which would
require the imposition of some additional smoothness assumptions over this conditional variance
function. Instead, if are willing to give up on efficiency to gain some robustness, we can take
A(R) = −D,

(R) = 1;

in which case we have
(R) = −1,

G(Z) = EP [D | X].

Equations (2.23) and (2.26) then give
ψ(W ; θ, η0 ) = (D − EP [D | X]) × (Y − Dθ − g0 (X))
= (D − m0 (X)) × (Y − Dθ − g0 (X)).
This score ψ is Neyman orthogonal and corresponds to the estimator of θ0 described in the
Introduction in (1.5). Note, however, that this score ψ is efficient only if σ (X, D) is a constant.
2.2.5. Neyman orthogonal scores and influence functions. Neyman orthogonality is a joint
property of the score ψ(W ; θ, η), the true parameter value η0 , the parameter set T , and the
distribution of W . It is not determined by any particular model for the parameter θ . Nevertheless,
it is possible to use semi-parametric efficiency calculations to construct the orthogonal score
from the original score as in Chernozhukov et al. (2016). Specifically, an orthogonal score can
be constructed by adding to the original score the influence function adjustment for estimation
of the nuisance functions that is analysed in Newey (1994). The resulting orthogonal score will
be the influence function of the limit of the average of the original score.
0 be a
To explain, consider the original score ϕ(W ; θ, β), where β is some function, and let β
non-parametric estimator of β0 , the true value of β. Here, β is implicitly allowed to depend on θ ,
though we suppress that dependence for notational convenience. The corresponding orthogonal
score can be formed when there is φ(W ; θ, η) such that

where η is a vector of nuisance functions that includes β, and φ(W ; θ, η) is an adjustment for
the presence of the estimated function β̂0 in the original score ϕ(W ; θ, β). The decomposition
(*) typically holds when β̂ is either a kernel or a series estimator with a suitably chosen tuning
parameter. The Neyman orthogonal score is given by
ψ(W ; θ, η) = ϕ(W ; θ, β) + φ(W ; θ, η).

ϕ(Wi ; θ0 , β̂0 ), as analysed
Here, ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 ) is the influence function of the limit of n−1

The form of the adjustment term φ(W ; θ, η) depends on the estimator β̂0 and, of course,
on the form of ϕ(W ; θ, β). Such adjustment terms have been derived for various β̂0 by Newey
(1994). Also, Ichimura and Newey (2015) show how the adjustment term can be computed from
the limit of a certain derivative. Any of these results can be applied to a particular starting score
ϕ(W ; θ, β) and estimator β̂0 to obtain an orthogonal score.
For example, consider again the partially linear model with the original score
ϕ(W ; θ, β) = D(Y − Dθ − g0 (X)).
Here, β̂0 = ĝ0 is a non-parametric regression estimator. From Newey (1994), we know that we
obtain the influence function adjustment by taking the conditional expectation of the derivative
of the score with respect to g0 (x) (obtaining −m0 (X) = −EP [D|X]) and multiplying the result
by the non-parametric residual to obtain
φ(W, θ, η) = −m0 (X){Y − Dθ − β(X, θ )}.
The corresponding orthogonal score is then simply
ψ(W ; θ, η) = {D − m0 (X)}{Y − Dθ − β(X, θ )},
β0 (X, θ ) = EP [Y − Dθ |X], m0 (X) = EP [D|X],
illustrating that an orthogonal score for the partially linear model can be derived from an
influence function adjustment.
Influence functions have been used to estimate functionals of non-parametric estimators
by Hasminskii and Ibragimov (1979) and Bickel and Ritov (1988). Newey et al. (1998, 2004)
showed that n−1/2 ni=1 ψ(Wi ; θ0 , η̂0 ) from (2.29) will have a second-order remainder in η̂0 ,
which is the key asymptotic property of orthogonal scores. Orthogonality of influence functions
in semi-parametric models follows from van der Vaart (1991), as shown for higher-order
counterparts in Robins et al. (2008, 2017). Chernozhukov et al. (2016) point out that, in general,
an orthogonal score can be constructed from an original score and non-parametric estimator β̂0
by adding to the original score the adjustment term for estimation of β0 as described above. This
construction provides a way of obtaining an orthogonal score from any initial score ϕ(W ; θ, β)
and non-parametric estimator β̂0 .

3. DML: POST-REGULARIZED INFERENCE BASED ON
NEYMAN-ORTHOGONAL ESTIMATING EQUATIONS
3.1. Definition of DML and its basic properties
We assume that we have a sample (Wi )N
i=1 , modelled as independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) copies of W , whose law is determined by the probability measure P on W. Estimation
will be carried out using the finite-sample analogue of the estimating equation (2.1).
We assume that the true value η0 of the nuisance parameter η can be estimated by η̂0 using a
part of the data (Wi )N
i=1 . Different structured assumptions on η0 allow us to use different machinelearning tools for estimating η0 , for example:
(1) approximate sparsity for η0 with respect to some dictionary calls for the use of forward
selection, lasso, post-lasso, 2 -boosting, or some other sparsity-based technique;


Double/debiased machine learning

(2) well-approximability of η0 by trees calls for the use of regression trees and random forests;
(3) well-approximability of η0 by sparse neural and deep neural nets calls for the use of 1 penalized neural and deep neural networks;
(4) well-approximability of η0 by at least one model mentioned in (1)–(3) above calls for the
use of an ensemble/aggregated method over the estimation methods mentioned in (1)–(3).
There are performance guarantees for most of these ML methods that make it possible to satisfy
the conditions stated below. Ensemble and aggregation methods ensure that the performance
guarantee is approximately no worse than the performance of the best method.
We assume that N is divisible by K in order to simplify the notation. The following algorithm
defines the simple cross-fitted DML as outlined in the Introduction.
D EFINITION 3.1. (DML 1) (a) Take a K-fold random partition (Ik )K
k=1 of observation indices
[N] = {1, . . . , N } such that the size of each fold Ik is n = N/K. Also, for each k ∈ [K] =
{1, . . . , K}, define Ikc := {1, . . . , N } \ Ik . (b) For each k ∈ [K], construct an ML estimator
η̂0,k = η̂0 ((Wi )i∈Ikc )
of η0 , where η̂0,k is a random element in T , and where randomness depends only on the subset
of data indexed by Ikc . (c) For each k ∈ [K], construct the estimator θ̌0,k as the solution of the
following equation:
En,k [ψ(W ; θ̌0,k , η̂0,k ] = 0,

(3.1)

where ψ is the Neyman orthogonal score, and En,k is the empirical expectation over the kth fold
of the data; that is, En,k [ψ(W )] = n−1 i∈Ik ψ(Wi ). If achievement of exact 0 is not possible,
define the estimator θ̌0,k of θ0 as an approximate N -solution:

This approach generalizes the 50–50 cross-fitting method mentioned in the Introduction.
We now define a variation of this basic cross-fitting approach that may behave better in small
samples.

R EMARK 3.1. (R ECOMMENDATIONS) The choice of K has no asymptotic impact under our
conditions but, of course, the choice of K may matter in small samples. Intuitively, larger values
of K provide more observations in Ikc from which to estimate the high-dimensional nuisance
functions, which seems to be the more difficult part of the problem. We have found moderate
values of K, such as 4 or 5, to work better than K = 2 in a variety of empirical examples and in
simulations. Moreover, we generally recommend DML2 over DML1 though in some problems
such as estimation of ATE in the interactive model, which we discuss later, there is no difference
between the two approaches. In most other problems, DML2 is better behaved because the pooled
empirical Jacobian for the equation in (3.4) exhibits more stable behaviour than the separate
empirical Jacobians for the equation in (3.1).
3.2. Moment condition models with linear scores
We first consider the case of linear scores, where
ψ(w; θ, η) = ψ a (w; η)θ + ψ b (w; η),

for all w ∈ W,

θ∈

, η ∈ T.

(3.6)

Let c0 > 0, c1 > 0, s > 0 and q > 2 be some finite constants such that c0 ≤ c1 , and let {δN }N≥1
and {N }N≥1 be some sequences of positive constants converging to zero such that δN ≥ N −1/2 .
Also, let K ≥ 2 be some fixed integer, and let {PN }N≥1 be some sequence of sets of probability
distributions P of W on W.
A SSUMPTION 3.1 (L INEAR SCORES WITH APPROXIMATE NEYMAN ORTHOGONALITY) For
all N ≥ 3 and P ∈ PN , the following conditions hold. (a) The true parameter value θ0 obeys
(2.1). (b) The score ψ is linear in the sense of (3.6). (c) The map η → EP [ψ(W ; θ, η)] is twice
continuously Gateaux-differentiable on T . (d) The score ψ obeys the Neyman orthogonality
or, more generally, the Neyman λN near-orthogonality condition at (θ0 , η0 ) with respect to the
nuisance realization set TN ⊂ T for

(e) The identification condition holds; namely, the singular values of the matrix

are between c0 and c1 .
Assumption 3.1 requires scores to be Neyman orthogonal or near-orthogonal and imposes
mild smoothness requirements as well as the canonical identification condition.

3.2 (S CORE REGULARITY AND QUALITY OF NUISANCE PARAMETER
For all N ≥ 3 and P ∈ PN , the following conditions hold. (a) Given a random
subset I of [N] of size n = N/K, the nuisance parameter estimator η̂0 = η̂0 ((Wi )i∈I c ) belongs to
the realization set TN with probability at least 1 − N , where TN contains η0 and is constrained
by the next conditions. (b) The moment conditions hold:
mN := sup (EP [ψ(W ; θ0 , η)q ])1/q ≤ c1 ;
η∈TN

mN := sup (EP [ψ a (W ; η)q ])1/q ≤ c1 .
η∈TN

(c) The following conditions on the statistical rates rN , rN , and λN hold:
rN := sup EP [ψ a (W ; η)] − EP [ψ a (W ; η0 )] ≤ δN ,
η∈TN

rN := sup (EP [ψ(W ; θ0 , η) − ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )2 ])1/2 ≤ δN ,
η∈TN

λN :=

sup
r∈(0,1),η∈TN

√
∂r2 EP [ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 + r(η − η0 ))] ≤ δN / N .

(d) The variance of the score ψ is non-degenerate: All eigenvalues of the matrix
EP [ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 ) ]
are bounded from below by c0 .
Assumptions 3.2(a)–(c) state that the estimator of the nuisance parameter belongs to the
realization set TN ⊂ T , which is a shrinking neighbourhood of η0 , that contracts around η0 with
the rate determined by the ‘statistical’ rates rN , rN and λN . These rates are not given in terms of
the norm  · T on T , but rather are the intrinsic rates that are most connected to the statistical
problem at hand. However, in smooth problems, as discussed below this translates, in the worst
cases, to the crude requirement that the nuisance parameters are estimated at the rate o(N −1/4 ).
The conditions in Assumption 3.2 embody refined requirements on the quality of nuisance
parameter estimators. In many applications, where (θ, η) → ψ(W ; θ, η) is smooth, we can bound
rN  εN ,

rN  εN ,

λN  εN2 ,

(3.7)

where εN is the upper bound on the rate of convergence of η̂0 to η0 with respect to the norm
 · T =  · P ,2 :
η̂0 − ηT  εN .
Note that TN can be chosen as the set of η that is within a neighbourhood of size εN of η0 ,
possibly with other restrictions, in this case. If only (3.7) holds, Assumption 3.2, particularly
λN = o(N −1/2 ), imposes the (crude) rate requirement
εN = o(N −1/4 ).

(3.8)

This rate is achievable for many ML methods under structured assumptions on the nuisance
parameters. Among many others, see Bickel et al. (2009), Bühlmann and van de Geer (2011),
Belloni et al. (2011, 2012) and Belloni and Chernozhukov (2011, 2013) for 1 -penalized and
related methods in a variety of sparse models, Kozbur (2016) for forward selection in sparse

models, Luo and Spindler (2016) for L2 -boosting in sparse linear models, Wager and Walther
(2016) for concentration results for a class of regression trees and random forests, and Chen and
White (1999) for a class of neural nets.
However, the presented conditions allow for more refined statements than (3.8). We note
that many important structured problems – such as estimation of parameters in PLR models,
estimation of parameters in partially linear structural equation models, and estimation of ATEs
under unconfoundedness – are such that some cross-derivatives vanish, allowing more refined
requirements than (3.8). This feature allows us to require much finer conditions on the quality of
the nuisance parameter estimators than the crude bound (3.8). For example, in many problems
λN = 0,

(3.9)

because the second derivatives vanish,
∂r2 EP [ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 + r(η − η0 ))] = 0.
This occurs in the following important examples:
(1) the optimal instrument problem (see Belloni et al., 2012);
(2) the PLR model when m0 (X) = 0 or is otherwise known (see Section 4);
(3) the treatment effect examples when the propensity score is known, which includes
randomized control trials as an important special case (see Section 5).
If both (3.7) and (3.9) hold, Assumption 3.2, particularly rN = o(1) and rN = o(1), imposes
the weakest possible rate requirement:
εN = o(1).
We note that similar refined rates have appeared in the context of estimation of treatment effects
in high-dimensional settings under sparsity; see Farrell (2015) and Athey et al. (2016) and the
related discussion in Remark 5.2. Our refined rate results complement this work by applying to
a broad class of estimation contexts, including estimation of ATEs, and to a broad set of ML
estimators.

means that the convergence holds under any sequence of probability distributions (PN )N≥1

methods not based on orthogonal scores.

Indeed, the above theorem implies that CI obeys PrPN ( θ0 ∈ CI) → (1 − α) under any

one may choose {PN } such that, for some N → 0

Theorem 3.1, if the score ψ is efficient for estimating θ0 at a given P ∈ P ⊂ PN , in the semiparametric sense as defined in van der Vaart (1998), then the large sample variance σ02 of θ̃0
reaches the semi-parametric efficiency bound at this P relative to the model P.

3.3. Models with non-linear scores
Let c0 > 0, c1 > 0, a > 1, v > 0, s > 0 and q > 2 be some finite constants, and let {δN }N≥1 ,
{N }N≥1 and {τN }N≥1 be some sequences of positive constants converging to zero. To derive the
properties of the DML estimator, we will use the following assumptions.
A SSUMPTION 3.3. (N ON-LINEAR MOMENT CONDITION PROBLEM WITH APPROXIMATE
≥ 3 and P ∈ PN , the following conditions hold. (a) The
true parameter value θ0 obeys (2.1), and contains a ball of radius c1 N −1/2 log N centred at θ0 .
(b) The map (θ, η) → EP [ψ(W ; θ, η)] is twice continuously Gateaux-differentiable on × T .
(c) For all θ ∈ , the identification relation
NEYMAN ORTHOGONALITY ) For all N

2EP [ψ(W ; θ, η0 )] ≥ J0 (θ − θ0 ) ∧ c0
is satisfied, for the Jacobian matrix
J0 := ∂θ {EP [ψ(W ; θ, η0 )]}|θ=θ0
having singular values between c0 and c1 . (d) The score ψ obeys the Neyman orthogonality or,
more generally, the Neyman near-orthogonality with λN = δN N −1/2 for the set TN ⊂ T .
Assumption 3.3 is mild and rather standard in moment condition problems. Assumption
3.3(a) requires θ0 to be sufficiently separated from the boundary of . Assumption 3.3(b)
only requires differentiability of the function (θ, η) → EP [ψ(W ; θ, η)] and does not require
differentiability of the function (θ, η) → ψ(W ; θ, η). Assumption 3.3(c) implies sufficient
identifiability of θ0 . Assumption 3.3(d) is the orthogonality condition that has already been
extensively discussed.
A SSUMPTION 3.4. (S CORE REGULARITY AND REQUIREMENTS ON THE QUALITY OF
ESTIMATION OF NUISANCE PARAMETERS ) Let K be a fixed integer. For all N ≥ 3 and P ∈ PN ,

the following conditions hold. (a) Given a random subset I of {1, . . . , N } of size n = N/K,
we have that the nuisance parameter estimator η̂0 = η̂0 ((Wi )i∈I c ) belongs to the realization set
TN with probability at least 1 − N , where TN contains η0 and is constrained by conditions
given below. (b) The parameter space
is bounded and for each η ∈ TN , the function class
F1,η = {ψj (·, θ, η) : j = 1, . . . , dθ , θ ∈ } is suitably measurable and its uniform covering
entropy obeys

(d) The variance of the score is non-degenerate. All eigenvalues of the matrix
EP [ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 ) ]
are bounded from below by c0 .
Assumptions 3.3(a)–(c) state that the estimator of the nuisance parameter belongs to the
realization set TN ⊂ T , which is a shrinking neighbourhood of η0 that contracts at the statistical
rates rN , rN and λN . These rates are not given in terms of the norm  · T on T , but rather
are intrinsic rates that are connected to the statistical problem at hand. In smooth problems,
these conditions translate to the crude requirement that nuisance parameters are estimated at the
o(N −1/4 ) rate, as discussed previously in the case with linear scores. However, these conditions
can be refined as, for example, when λN = 0 or when some cross-derivatives vanish in λN ;
see the linear case in the previous subsection for further discussion. Suitable measurability and
pointwise entropy conditions, required in Assumption 3.4(b), are mild regularity conditions that
are satisfied in all practical cases. The assumption of a bounded parameter space in Assumption
3.4(b) is embedded in the entropy condition, but we state it separately for clarity. This assumption
was not needed in the linear case, and it can be removed in the non-linear case with the imposition
of more complicated Huber-like regularity conditions. Assumption 3.4(c) is a set of mild growth
conditions.
R EMARK 3.2. (R ATE REQUIREMENTS ON NUISANCE PARAMETER ESTIMATORS) Similar
to the discussion in the linear case, the conditions in Assumption 3.4 are very flexible
and embody refined requirements on the quality of the nuisance parameter estimators. The
conditions essentially reduce to the previous conditions in the linear case, with the exception
of compactness, which is imposed to make the conditions easy to verify in non-linear cases.
T HEOREM 3.3. (P ROPERTIES OF THE DML FOR NON-LINEAR SCORES) Suppose that
Assumptions 3.3 and 3.4 hold. In addition, suppose that δN ≥ N −1/2+1/q log N and that

Moreover, in the statement above, σ 2 can be replaced by a consistent estimator σ̂ 2 , obeying
σ̂ 2 = σ 2 + oP (N ) uniformly in P ∈ PN , with the size of the remainder term updated as ρN =
ρN + N . Furthermore, Corollaries 3.1 and 3.2 continue to hold under the conditions of this
theorem.

sample for estimating the parameter of interest. Although the specific sample partition has no
impact on estimation results asymptotically, the effect of the particular random split on the
estimate can be important in finite samples. To make the results more robust with respect to
the partitioning, we propose to repeat the DML estimator S times, obtaining the estimates
θ̃0s ,

s = 1, . . . , S.

Features of these estimates may then provide insight into the sensitivity of results to the sample
splitting, and we can report results that incorporate features of this set of estimates that should
be less driven by any particular sample-splitting realization.

where the median picks out the matrix with median operator norm, which preserve non-negative
definiteness.
We recommend using medians, reporting θ̃0median and σ̂ 2,median , as these quantities are more
robust to outliers.
C OROLLARY 3.3. If S is fixed, as N → ∞ and maintaining either Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2 or
Assumptions 3.3 and 3.4 as appropriate, θ̃0mean and θ̃0median are first-order equivalent to θ̃0 and
obey the conclusions of Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 or of Theorem 3.3. Moreover, σ̂ 2,median and σ̂ 2,mean
can replace σ̂ in the statement of the appropriate theorems.
It would be interesting to investigate the behaviour under the regime where S → ∞ as
N → ∞.

Double/debiased machine learning

The parameter of interest is the regression coefficient θ0 . If D is conditionally exogenous (as good
as randomly assigned conditional on covariates), then θ0 measures the average causal/treatment
effect of D on potential outcomes.
The first approach to inference on θ0 , which we described in the Introduction, is to employ
the DML method using the score function
ψ(W ; θ, η) := {Y − Dθ − g(X)}(D − m(X)),

η = (g, m),

(4.3)

where W = (Y, D, X), and g and m are P -square-integrable functions mapping the support of
X to R. It is easy to see that θ0 satisfies the moment condition EP ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 ) = 0, and also the
orthogonality condition ∂η EP ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )[η − η0 ] = 0 where η0 = (g0 , m0 ).
A second approach employs the Robinson-style ‘partialling-out’ score function
ψ(W ; θ, η) := {Y − (X) − θ (D − m(X))}(D − m(X)),

η = (, m),

(4.4)

where W = (Y, D, X) and  and m are P -square-integrable functions mapping the support of X
to R. This gives an alternative parametrization of the score function above, and using this score
is first-order equivalent to using the previous score. It is easy to see that θ0 satisfies the moment
condition EP ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 ) = 0, and also the orthogonality condition ∂η EP ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )[η −
η0 ] = 0, for η0 = (0 , m0 ), where 0 (X) = EP [Y |X].
In the partially linear model, the DML approach complements Belloni et al. (2013, 2014a,b,
2015), Zhang and Zhang (2014), van de Geer et al. (2014) and Javanmard and Montanari
(2014b), all of which consider estimation and inference for parameters within the partially
linear model using lasso-type methods without cross-fitting. By relying upon cross-fitting, the
DML approach allows for the use of a much broader collection of ML methods for estimating
the nuisance functions and also allows relaxation of sparsity conditions in the case where
lasso or other sparsity-based estimators are used. Both the DML approach and the approaches
taken in the aforementioned papers can be seen as heuristically debiasing the score function
(Y − Dθ − g(X))D, which does not possess the orthogonality property unless m0 (X) = 0.

The following theorem follows as a corollary to the results in Section 3 by verifying
Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2, and it will be proven as a special case of Theorem 4.2 below.
T HEOREM 4.1. (DML INFERENCE ON REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS IN THE PARTIALLY

uniformly over P ∈ P, where σ 2 = (EP [V 2 ])−1 EP [V 2 U 2 ](EP [V 2 ])−1 . Moreover, the result
continues to hold if σ 2 is replaced by σ̂ 2 defined in Theorem 3.2. Consequently, confidence
regions based upon the DML estimators θ̃0 have uniform asymptotic validity:
√
lim sup |P r P (θ0 ∈ [θ̃0 ± −1 (1 − α/2)σ̂ / N]) − (1 − α)| = 0.

R EMARK 4.2. (A SYMPTOTIC EFFICIENCY UNDER HOMOSCEDASTICITY) Under conditional
homoscedasticity, i.e. E[U 2 |Z] = E[U 2 ], the asymptotic variance σ 2 reduces to E[V 2 ]−1 E[U 2 ],
which is the semi-parametric efficiency bound for θ .
R EMARK 4.3. (T IGHTNESS OF CONDITIONS UNDER CROSS-FITTING) The conditions in
Theorem 4.1 are sharp, though they are simplified for ease of presentation. The sharpness can be
understood by examining the case where the regression function g0 and the propensity function

(ignoring logs) required without sample splitting. For example, if the propensity function m0 is
very sparse (low sm ), then the regression function is allowed to be quite dense (high sg ), and
vice versa. If the propensity function is known (s m = 0) or can be estimated at the N −1/2 rate,
then only consistency for ĝ0 is needed. Such comparisons also extend to approximately sparse
models.
4.2. Inference in partially linear IV models
Here we extend the PLR model studied in Section 4.1 to allow for IV identification. Specifically,
we consider the model
Y = Dθ0 + g0 (X) + U,
Z = m0 (X) + V ,

EP [U | X, Z] = 0,

(4.5)

EP [V | X] = 0,

(4.6)

where Z is the instrumental variable. As before, the parameter of interest is θ and its true value
is θ0 . If Z = D, the model (4.5)–(4.6) coincides with (4.1)–(4.2) but is otherwise different.

Double/debiased machine learning

To estimate θ0 and to perform inference on it, we use the score
ψ(W ; θ, η) := (Y − Dθ − g(X))(Z − m(X)),

η = (g, m),

(4.7)

where W = (Y, D, X, Z) and g and m are P -square-integrable functions mapping the support of
X to R. Alternatively, we can use the Robinson-style score
ψ(W ; θ, η) := (Y − (X) − θ (D − r(X)))(Z − m(X)),

η = (, m, r),

(4.8)

where W = (Y, D, X, Z) and , m and r are P -square-integrable functions mapping the support
of X to R. It is straightforward to verify that both scores satisfy the moment condition
EP [ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )] = 0 and also the orthogonality condition ∂η EP [ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )][η − η0 ] = 0,
for η0 = (g0 , m0 ) in the former case and η0 = (0 , m0 , r0 ) for 0 and r0 defined by 0 (X) =
EP [Y | X] and r0 (X) = EP [D | X], respectively, in the latter case.8
Note that the score in (4.8) has a minor advantage over the score in (4.7) because all of its
nuisance parameters are conditional mean functions, which can be directly estimated by the ML
methods. If one prefers to use the score in (4.7), one has to construct an estimator of g0 first.
To do so, one can first obtain a DML estimator of θ0 based on the score in (4.8), say θ̃0 . Then,
using the fact that g0 (X) = EP [Y − Dθ0 | X], one can construct an estimator ĝ0 by applying an
ML method to regress Y − D θ̃0 on X. Alternatively, one can use assumption-specific methods to
directly estimate g0 , without using the score (4.8) first. For example, if g0 can be approximated
by a sparse linear combination of a large set of transformations of X, one can use the methods of
Gautier and Tsybakov (2014) to obtain an estimator of g0 .

5. INFERENCE ON TREATMENT EFFECTS IN THE INTERACTIVE MODEL
5.1. Inference on ATE and ATTE
In this section, we specialize the results of Section 3 to estimate treatment effects under the
unconfoundedness assumption of Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983). Within this setting, there is a
large classical literature focused on low-dimensional settings that provides methods for adjusting
for confounding variables including regression methods, propensity score adjustment methods,
matching methods, and ‘doubly-robust’ combinations of these methods; see, e.g. Robins and
Rotnitzky (1995), Hahn (1998), Hirano et al. (2003) and Abadie and Imbens (2006) as well as
the textbook overview provided in Imbens and Rubin (2015). In this section, we present results
that complement this important classic work as well as the rapidly expanding body of work on
estimation under unconfoundedness using ML methods; see, among others, Athey et al. (2016),
Belloni et al. (2014a, 2017), Farrell (2015) and Imai and Ratkovic (2013).
We specifically consider estimation of ATEs when treatment effects are fully heterogeneous
and the treatment variable is binary, D ∈ {0, 1}. We consider vectors (Y, D, X) such that
Y = g0 (D, X) + U,
D = m0 (X) + V ,

EP [U | X, D] = 0,

(5.1)

EP [V | X] = 0.

(5.2)

Because D is not additively separable, this model is more general than the partially linear model
for the case of binary D. A common target parameter of interest in this model is the ATE:9
θ0 = EP [g0 (1, X) − g0 (0, X)].
Another common target parameter is the ATTE:
θ0 = EP [g0 (1, X) − g0 (0, X)|D = 1].
The confounding factors X affect the policy variable via the propensity score m0 (X) and the
outcome variable via the function g0 (D, X). Both of these functions are unknown and potentially
complicated, and we can employ ML methods to learn them.

9 Without unconfoundedness/conditional exogeneity, these quantities measure association, and could be referred to as
average predictive effect (APE) and average predictive effect for the exposed (APEX). Inferential results for these objects
would follow immediately from Theorem 5.1.

We proceed to set up moment conditions with scores obeying orthogonality conditions. For
estimation of the ATE, we employ

D(Y − g(1, X)) (1 − D)(Y − g(0, X))

mapping the support of (D, X) to R and the support of X to (ε, 1 − ε), respectively, for some
ε ∈ (0, 1/2). The true value of η is η0 = (g0 , m0 ). This orthogonal moment condition is based on
the influence function for the mean for missing data from Robins and Rotnitzky (1995).
For estimation of the ATTE, we use the score
ψ(W ; θ, η) =

for some ε ∈ (0, 1/2). The true value of η is η0 = (g 0 , m0 , p0 ), where g 0 (X) = g0 (0, X) and
p0 = EP [D]. Note that estimating ATTE does not require estimating g0 (1, X). Note also that
because p is a constant, it does not affect the DML estimators θ̃0 based on the score ψ in (5.4),
but having p simplifies the formula for the variance of θ̃0 .
Using their respective scores, it can be easily seen that true parameter values θ0 for ATE
and ATTE obey the moment condition EP [ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )] = 0, and also that the orthogonality
condition ∂η EP [ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )][η − η0 ] = 0 holds.

R EMARK 5.1. The only non-primitive condition here is the assumption on the rate of estimating
the nuisance parameters. These rates of convergence are available for the most often used ML
methods and are case-specific, so we do not restate conditions that are needed to reach these
rates. The conditions are not the tightest possible, but offer a set of simple conditions under
which Theorem 5.1 follows as a special case of the general theorem provided in Section 3. We
could obtain more refined conditions by doing customized proofs.
The following theorem follows as a corollary to the results in Section 3 by verifying
Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2.

T HEOREM 5.1. (DML INFERENCE ON ATE AND ATTE) Suppose that the target parameter is
either ATE, θ0 = EP [g0 (1, X) − g0 (0, X)], and the score ψ in (5.3) is used, or ATTE, θ0 =
EP [g0 (1, X) − g0 (0, X) | D = 1], and the score ψ in (5.4) is used. In addition, suppose that
Assumption 5.1 holds. Then the DML1 and DML2 estimators θ̃0 , constructed in Definitions 3.1
and 3.2, are first-order equivalent and obey
√
(5.5)
σ −1 N(θ̃0 − θ0 )  N(0, 1),
uniformly over P ∈ P, where σ 2 = EP [ψ 2 (W ; θ0 , η0 )]. Moreover, the result continues to hold if
σ 2 is replaced by σ̂ 2 defined in Theorem 3.2. Consequently, confidence regions based upon the
DML estimators θ̃0 have uniform asymptotic validity:
√
lim sup |P r P (θ0 ∈ [θ̃0 ± −1 (1 − α/2)σ̂ / N]) − (1 − α)| = 0.
N→∞ P ∈P

The scores ψ in (5.3) and (5.4) are efficient, so both estimators are asymptotically efficient,
reaching the semi-parametric efficiency bound of Hahn (1998).
R EMARK 5.2. (T IGHTNESS OF CONDITIONS) The conditions in Assumption 5.1 are sharp

considers estimation of treatment effects in a setting where an approximately sparse model holds
for both the regression

(2016) show that N-consistent estimation of an ATE is possible under very weak conditions

Thus, the approach taken in this context and by Athey et al. (2016) are complementary, and
either might be preferred, depending on whether or not the regression function can be estimated
extremely well based on a sparse method.
5.2. Inference on local average treatment effects
In this section, we consider estimation of LATEs with a binary treatment variable, D ∈ {0, 1},
and a binary instrument, Z ∈ {0, 1}.10 As before, Y denotes the outcome variable, and X is the
vector of covariates.
10 Similar results can be provided for the local average treatment effect on the treated (LATT) by adapting the following
arguments to use the orthogonal scores for the LATT; see, e.g. Belloni et al. (2017).

6. EMPIRICAL EXAMPLES
To illustrate the methods developed in the preceding sections, we consider three empirical
examples. The first example reexamines the Pennsylvania Reemployment Bonus experiment,
which used a randomized control trial to investigate the incentive effect of unemployment
insurance. In the second, we use the DML method to estimate the effect of 401(k) eligibility,
the treatment variable, and 401(k) participation, a self-selected decision to receive the treatment
that we instrument for with assignment to the treatment state, on accumulated assets. In this
example, the treatment variable is not randomly assigned and we aim to eliminate the potential
biases due to the lack of random assignment by flexibly controlling for a rich set of variables. In
the third, we revisit the IV estimation by Acemoglu et al. (2001) of the effects of institutions on
economic growth by estimating a partially linear IV model.
6.1. Effect of unemployment insurance bonus on unemployment duration
In this example, we reanalyse the Pennsylvania Reemployment Bonus experiment, which was
conducted by the US Department of Labor in the 1980s to test the incentive effects of alternative
compensation schemes for unemployment insurance (UI). This experiment has been previously
studied by Bilias (2000) and Bilias and Koenker (2002). In these experiments, UI claimants were
randomly assigned either to a control group or to one of five treatment groups.11 In the control
group, the standard rules of the UI system applied. Individuals in the treatment groups were
offered a cash bonus if they found a job within some pre-specified period of time (qualification
period), provided that the job was retained for a specified duration. The treatments differed in the
level of the bonus, the length of the qualification period, and whether the bonus was declining
over time in the qualification period; see Bilias and Koenker (2002) for further details.
In our empirical example, we focus only on the most generous compensation scheme,
treatment 4, and we drop all individuals who received other treatments. In this treatment,
the bonus amount is high and the qualification period is long compared to other treatments,
and claimants are eligible to enroll in a workshop. Our treatment variable, D, is an indicator
variable for being assigned treatment 4, and the outcome variable, Y , is the log of duration of
unemployment for the UI claimants. The vector of covariates, X, consists of age group dummies,

There are six treatment groups in the experiments. Following Bilias (2000). we merge groups 4 and 6.

gender, race, the number of dependents, quarter of the experiment, location within the state,
existence of recall expectations and type of occupation.
We report results based on five simple methods for estimating the nuisance functions used
in forming the orthogonal estimating equations. We consider three tree-based methods, labelled
‘Random forest’, ‘Reg. tree’ and ‘Boosting’, one 1 -penalization based method, labelled ‘Lasso’
and a neural network method, labelled ‘Neural network’. For Reg. tree, we fit a single CART tree
to estimate each nuisance function with penalty parameter chosen by tenfold cross-validation.
The results in the Random forest column are obtained by estimating each nuisance function with
a random forest that averages over 1000 trees. The results in Boosting are obtained using boosted
regression trees with regularization parameters chosen by tenfold cross-validation. To estimate
the nuisance functions using the neural networks, we use two neurons and a decay parameter
of 0.02, and we set activation function as logistic for classification problems and as linear for
regression problems.12 Lasso estimates an 1 -penalized linear regression model using the datadriven penalty parameter selection rule developed in Belloni et al. (2012). For Lasso, we use a
set of 96 potential control variables formed from the raw set of covariates and all second-order
terms (i.e. all squares and first-order interactions). For the remaining methods, we use the raw
set of covariates as features.
We also consider two hybrid methods labelled ‘Ensemble’ and ‘Best’. Ensemble optimally
combines four of the ML methods listed above by estimating the nuisance functions as weighted
averages of estimates from Lasso, Boosting, Random forest and Neural network. The weights
are restricted to sum to one and are chosen so that the weighted average of these methods
gives the lowest average mean squared out-of-sample prediction error estimated using fivefold
cross-validation. The final column in Table 1 (Best) reports results that combine the methods
in a different way. After obtaining estimates from the five simple methods and Ensemble, we
select the best methods for estimating each nuisance function based on the average out-of-sample
prediction performance for the target variable associated with each nuisance function obtained
from each of the previously described approaches. As a result, the reported estimate in the last
column uses different ML methods to estimate different nuisance functions. Note that if a single
method outperformed all the others in terms of prediction accuracy for all nuisance functions,
the estimate in the Best column would be identical to the estimate reported under that method.
Table 1 presents DML2 estimates of the ATE on unemployment duration using the median
method described in Section 3.4. We report results for the heterogeneous effect model in Panel
A and for the partially linear model in Panel B. Because the treatment is randomly assigned,
we use the fraction of treated as the estimator of the propensity score in forming the orthogonal
estimating equations.13 For both the partially linear model and the interactive model, we report
estimates obtained using twofold cross-fitting and fivefold cross-fitting. All results are based
on taking 100 different sample splits. We summarize results across the sample splits using the
median method. For comparison, we report two different standard errors: in brackets, we report
the median standard errors from across the 100 splits; in parentheses, we report standard errors
adjusted for variability across the sample splits using the median method in parentheses.

12 We also experimented with Deep Learning methods from which we obtained similar results for some tuning
parameters. However, we ran into stability and computational issues and we have chosen not to report these results
in the empirical section.
13 We also estimated the effects using non-parametric estimates of the conditional propensity score obtained from the
ML procedures given in the column labels. As expected due to randomization, the results are similar to those provided
in Table 1 and are not reported for brevity.

based on 100 splits with point estimates calculated the median method. The median standard errors across the splits
are reported in brackets and standard errors calculated using the median method to adjust for variation across splits are
provided in parentheses. Further details about the methods are provided in the main text.

The estimation results are consistent with the findings of previous studies that have analysed
the Pennsylvania Bonus Experiment. The ATE on unemployment duration is negative and
significant across all estimation methods at the 5% level regardless of the standard error estimator
used. Interestingly, we see that there is no practical difference across the two different standard
errors in this example.

6.2. Effect of 401(k) eligibility and participation on net financial assets
The key problem in determining the effect of 401(k) eligibility is that working for a firm that
offers access to a 401(k) plan is not randomly assigned. To overcome the lack of random
assignment, we follow the strategy developed in Poterba et al. (1994a,b). In these papers, the
authors use data from the 1991 Survey of Income and Program Participation and they argue that
eligibility for enrolling in a 401(k) plan in these data can be taken as exogenous after conditioning
on a few observables – of which the most important for their argument is income. The basic idea
of their argument is that, at least around the time 401(k) initially became available, people were
unlikely to be basing their employment decisions on whether an employer offered a 401(k) but
would instead focus on income and other aspects of the job. Following this argument, whether
one is eligible for a 401(k) may then be taken as exogenous after appropriately conditioning on
income and other control variables related to job choice.
A key component of the argument underlying the exogeneity of 401(k) eligibility is that
eligibility can only be taken as exogenous after conditioning on income and other variables
related to job choice that might correlate with whether a firm offers a 401(k). Poterba et al.
(1994a,b) and many subsequent papers adopt this argument but control only linearly for a small

number of terms. One might wonder whether such specifications are able to adequately control
for income and other related confounds. At the same time, the power to learn about treatment
effects decreases as one allows more flexible models. The principled use of flexible ML tools
offers one resolution to this tension. The results presented below thus complement previous
results that rely on the assumption that confounding effects can adequately be controlled for
by a small number of variables chosen ex ante by the researcher.
In the example in this paper, we use the same data as in Chernozhukov and Hansen (2004). We
use net financial assets – defined as the sum of IRA balances, 401(k) balances, checking accounts,
US saving bonds, other interest-earning accounts in banks and other financial institutions, other
interest-earning assets (such as bonds held personally), stocks, and mutual funds less nonmortgage debt – as the outcome variable, Y , in our analysis. Our treatment variable, D, is an
indicator for being eligible to enroll in a 401(k) plan. The vector of raw covariates, X, consists
of age, income, family size, years of education, a married indicator, a two-earner status indicator,
a defined benefit pension status indicator, an IRA participation indicator, and a home-ownership
indicator.
In Table 2, we report DML2 estimates of ATE of 401(k) eligibility on net financial assets
both in the partially linear model as in (1.1) and allowing for heterogeneous treatment effects
using the interactive model outlined in Section 5.1. To reduce the disproportionate impact of
extreme propensity score weights in the interactive model, we trim the propensity scores at 0.01
and 0.99. We present two sets of results based on sample splitting as discussed in Section 3
using twofold cross-fitting and fivefold cross-fitting. As in the previous section, we consider 100
different sample partitions and summarize the results across different sample splits using the
median method. For comparison, we report two different standard errors: in brackets, we report
the median standard errors from across the 100 splits; in parentheses, we report standard errors

adjusted for variability across the sample splits using the median method. We consider the same
methods with the same tuning choices for estimating the nuisance functions as in the previous
example, with one exception, and so we do not repeat details for brevity. The one exception is
that we implement neural networks with eight neurons and a decay parameter of 0.01 in this
example.
Turning to the results, it is first worth noting that the estimated ATE of 401(k) eligibility
on net financial assets is $19,559 with an estimated standard error of 1413 when no control
variables are used. Of course, this number is not a valid estimate of the causal effect of 401(k)
eligibility on financial assets if there are neglected confounding variables as suggested by Poterba
et al. (1994a,b). When we turn to the estimates that flexibly account for confounding reported
in Table 2, we see that they are substantially attenuated relative to this baseline that does not
account for confounding, suggesting much smaller causal effects of 401(k) eligibility on financial
asset holdings. It is interesting and reassuring that the results obtained from the different flexible
methods are broadly consistent with each other. This similarity is consistent with the theory
that suggests that results obtained through the use of orthogonal estimating equations and any
sensible method of estimating the necessary nuisance functions should be similar. Finally, it is
interesting that these results are also broadly consistent with those reported in the original work
of Poterba et al. (1994a,b), who used a simple intuitively motivated functional form, suggesting
that this intuitive choice was sufficiently flexible to capture much of the confounding variation in
this example.
As a further illustration, we also report the LATE in this example where we take the
endogenous treatment variable to be participating in a 401(k) plan. Even after controlling for
features related to job choice, it seems likely that the actual choice of whether to participate in
an offered plan would be endogenous. Of course, we can use eligibility for a 401(k) plan as an
instrument for participation in a 401(k) plan under the conditions that were used to justify the
exogeneity of eligibility for a 401(k) plan provided above in the discussion of estimation of the
ATE of 401(k) eligibility.
We report DML2 results of estimating the LATE of 401(k) participation using 401(k)
eligibility as an instrument in Table 3. We employ the procedure outlined in Section 5.2 using the
same ML estimators to estimate the quantities used to form the orthogonal estimating equation
as we employed to estimate the ATE of 401(k) eligibility outlined previously, so we omit the
details for brevity. Looking at the results, we see that the estimated causal effect of 401(k)
participation on net financial assets is uniformly positive and statistically significant across all of

the considered methods. As when looking at the ATE of 401(k) eligibility, it is reassuring that the
results obtained from the different flexible methods are broadly consistent with each other. It is
also interesting that the results based on flexible ML methods are broadly consistent with, though
somewhat attenuated relative to, those obtained by applying the same specification for controls
as used in Poterba et al. (1994a,b) and using a linear IV model, which returns an estimated effect
of participation of $13,102 with estimated standard error of (1922). The mild attenuation may
suggest that the simple intuitive control specification used in the original baseline specification
is too simplistic.
Looking at Tables 2 and 3, there are other interesting observations that can provide useful
insights into understanding the finite sample properties of the DML estimation method. First,
the standard errors of the estimates obtained using fivefold cross-fitting are lower than those
obtained from twofold cross-fitting for all methods across all cases. This fact suggests that having
more observations in the auxiliary sample may be desirable. Specifically, the fivefold cross-fitting
estimates use more observations to learn the nuisance functions than twofold cross-fitting and
thus are likely learn them more precisely. This increase in precision in learning the nuisance
functions may then translate into more precisely estimated parameters of interest. While intuitive,
we note that this statement does not seem to be generalizable, in that there does not appear to be a
general relationship between the number of folds in cross-fitting and the precision of the estimate
of the parameter of interest (see the next example). Secondly, we also see that the standard errors
of the Lasso estimates after adjusting for variation due to sample splitting are noticeably larger
than the standard errors coming from the other ML methods. We believe that this is due to the
fact that the out-of-sample prediction errors from a linear model tend to be larger when there is a
need to extrapolate. In our framework, if the main sample includes observations that are outside
of the range of the observations in the auxiliary sample, the model has to extrapolate to those
observations. The fact that the standard errors are lower in fivefold cross-fitting than in twofold
cross-fitting for the Lasso estimations also supports this hypothesis, because the higher number
of observations in the auxiliary sample reduces the degree of extrapolation. We also see that there
is a noticeable increase in the standard errors that account for variability due to sample splitting
relative to the simple unadjusted standard errors in this case, though these differences do not
qualitatively change the results.

6.3. Effect of institutions on economic growth
To demonstrate DML estimation of partially linear structural equation models with instrumental
variables, we consider estimation of the effect of institutions on aggregate output following
the work of Acemoglu et al. (2001, hereafter AJR). Estimating the effect of institutions on
output is complicated by the clear potential for simultaneity between institutions and output.
Specifically, better institutions may lead to higher incomes, but higher incomes may also lead
to the development of better institutions. To help overcome this simultaneity, AJR use mortality
rates for early European settlers as an instrument for institution quality. The validity of this
instrument hinges on the arguments that settlers set up better institutions in places where they
are more likely to establish long-term settlements, that where they are likely to settle for the
long term is related to settler mortality at the time of initial colonization, and that institutions
are highly persistent. The exclusion restriction for the instrumental variable is then motivated by
the argument that GDP, while persistent, is unlikely to be strongly influenced by mortality in the
previous century, or earlier, except through institutions.

Note: Estimated coefficient from a linear IV model based on orthogonal estimating equations. Column labels denote the
method used to estimate nuisance functions. Results are based on 100 splits with point estimates calculated the median
method. The median standard errors across the splits are reported in brackets and standard errors calculated using the
median method to adjust for variation across splits are provided in parentheses. Further details about the methods are
provided in the main text.

In their paper, AJR note that their IV strategy will be invalidated if other factors are also
highly persistent and related to the development of institutions within a country and to the
country’s GDP. A leading candidate for such a factor, as they discuss, is geography. AJR address
this by assuming that the confounding effect of geography is adequately captured by a linear term
in distance from the equator and a set of continent dummy variables. Using DML allows us to
relax this assumption and to replace it by a weaker assumption that geography can be sufficiently
controlled by an unknown function of distance from the equator and continent dummies, which
can be learned by ML methods.
We use the same set of 64 country-level observations as AJR. The data set contains
measurements of GDP, settler morality, an index that measures protection against expropriation
risk and geographic information. The outcome variable, Y , is the logarithm of GDP per capita
and the endogenous explanatory variable, D, is a measure of the strength of individual property
rights that is used as a proxy for the strength of institutions. To deal with endogeneity, we use
an instrumental variable Z, which is mortality rates for early European settlers. Our raw set of
control variables, X, include distance from the equator and dummy variables for Africa, Asia,
North America and South America.
We report results from applying DML2 following the procedure outlined in Section 4.2
in Table 4. The considered ML methods and tuning parameters are the same as the previous
examples except for the Ensemble method, from which we exclude Neural network, as the
small sample size causes stability problems in training the neural network. We use the raw
set of covariates and all second-order terms when doing Lasso estimation, and we simply use
the raw set of covariates in the remaining methods. As in the previous examples, we consider
100 different sample splits and report the median estimates of the coefficient and two different
standard error estimates. In brackets, we report the median standard errors from across the 100
splits, and we report standard errors adjusted for variability across the sample splits using the
median method in parentheses. Finally, we report results from both twofold cross-fitting and
fivefold cross-fitting as in the other examples.
In this example, we see uniformly large and positive point estimates across all procedures
considered, and estimated effects are statistically significant at the 5% level. As in the second
example, we see that adjusting for variability across sample splits leads to noticeable increases in
estimated standard errors but does not result in qualitatively different conclusions. Interestingly,
we see that the estimated standard errors based on fivefold cross-fitting are larger than those

based on twofold cross-fitting in all procedures except lasso, which differs from the finding in
the 401(k) example. Further understanding these differences and the impact of the number of
folds on inference for objects of interest seems to be an interesting question for future research.
Finally, although the estimated coefficients are somewhat smaller than the baseline estimates
reported in AJR – an estimated coefficient of 1.10 with estimated standard error of 0.46 (see
AJR, Table 4, Panel A, column 7) – the results are qualitatively similar, indicating a strong and
positive effect of institutions on output.
6.4. Comments on empirical results
Before closing this section, we want to emphasize some important conclusions that can be drawn
from these empirical examples. First, the choice of the ML method used in estimating nuisance
functions does not substantively change the conclusion in any of the examples, and we have
obtained broadly consistent results regardless of which method we employ. The robustness of
the results to the different methods is implied by the theory assuming that all of the employed
methods are able to deliver sufficiently high-quality approximations to the underlying nuisance
functions. Secondly, the incorporation of uncertainty due to sample splitting using the median
method increases the standard errors relative to a baseline that does not account for this
uncertainty, though these differences do not alter the main results in any of the examples. This
lack of variation suggests that the parameter estimates are robust to the particular sample split
used in the estimation in these examples.

APPENDIX: PROOFS OF RESULTS
In this appendix, we use C to denote a strictly positive constant that is independent of n and P ∈ PN . The
value of C may change at each appearance. Also, the notation aN  bN means that aN ≤ CbN for all n and
some C. The notation aN  bN means that bN  aN . Moreover, the notation aN = o(1) means that there
exists a sequence (bN )n≥1 of positive numbers such that (a) |aN | ≤ bN for all n, (b) bN is independent of
P ∈ PN for all n and (c) bN → 0 as n → ∞. Finally, the notation aN = OP (bN ) means that for all  > 0,
there exists C such that P r P (aN > CbN ) ≤ 1 −  for all n. Using this notation allows us to avoid repeating
‘uniformly over P ∈ PN ’ many times in the proofs.

The following lemma is useful particularly in the sample-splitting contexts.
L EMMA 6.1. (C ONDITIONAL CONVERGENCE IMPLIES UNCONDITIONAL) Let {Xm } and {Ym } be
sequences of random vectors. (a) If, for m → 0, Pr(Xm  > m | Ym ) →Pr 0, then Pr(Xm  > m ) → 0. In
particular, this occurs if E[Xm q /mq | Ym ] →Pr 0 for some q ≥ 1, by Markov’s inequality. (b) Let {Am } be
a sequence of positive constants. If Xm  = OP (Am ) conditional on Ym , namely, that for any m → ∞,
P r(Xm  > m Am | Ym ) →Pr 0, then Xm  = OP (Am ) unconditionally, namely, that for any m → ∞,
Pr(Xm  > m Am ) → 0.
Proof: (a) For any  > 0 P r(Xm  > m ) ≤ E[P r(Xm  > m | Ym )] → 0, as the sequence {P r(Xm  >
m | Ym )} is uniformly integrable. To show the second part note that P r(Xm  > m | Ym ) ≤
p
E[Xm q /mq | Ym ] ∨ 1 → 0 by Markov’s inequality. (b) This follows from (a).

Let (Wi )ni=1 be a sequence of independent copies of a random element W taking values in a measurable
space (W, AW ) according to a probability law P . Let F be a set of suitably measurable functions f : W →

Proof of Lemma 2.1: Because J exists and Jββ is invertible, (2.8) has the unique solution μ0 given in

where Idθ ×dθ is the dθ × dθ identity matrix and ⊗ is the Kronecker product. Hence, the asserted claim holds
by the remark after Definition 2.1.

Proof of Lemma 2.2: The proof is similar to that of Lemma 2.1, except that now we have to verify (2.4)
intead of (2.3). To do so, take any β ∈ B such that β − β0 ∗q ≤ λN /rN and any dθ × dβ matrix μ. Denote
η = (β , vec(μ) ) . Then
∂η EP ψ(W, θ0 , η0 )[η − η0 ] = (Jθβ − μ0 Jββ )(β − β0 )
≤ Jθβ − μ0 Jββ q × β − β0 ∗q ≤ rn × (λN /rN ) = λN .


This completes the proof of the lemma.
Proof of Lemma 2.3: The proof is similar to that of Lemma 2.1, except that now we have
∂η EP ψ(W, θ0 , η0 ) = [μ0 Gβ , EP m(W, θ0 , β0 ) ⊗ Idθ ×dθ ] = 0,
where Idθ ×dθ is the dθ × dθ identity matrix and ⊗ is the Kronecker product.



Proof of Lemma 2.4: The proof is similar to that of Lemma 2.2, except that now for any β ∈ B such that
β − β0 1 ≤ λN / rN , any dθ × k matrix μ, and η = (β , vec(μ) ) , we have
∂η EP ψ(W, θ0 , η0 )[η − η0 ] = μ0 Gβ (β − β0 )
≤ A −1/2 L − γ0 L L∞ × β − β0 1


Proof of Lemma 2.5: Take any η ∈ T , and consider the function
Q(W ; θ, r) := (W ; θ, η0 (θ ) + r(η(θ ) − η0 (θ ))),

θ∈

, r ∈ [0, 1].

Then
ψ(W ; θ, η0 + r(η − η0 )) = ∂θ Q(W ; θ, r),
and so
∂r EP [ψ(W ; θ, η0 + r(η − η0 ))] = ∂r EP [∂θ Q(W ; θ, r)]
= ∂r ∂θ EP [Q(W ; θ, r)] = ∂θ ∂r EP [Q(W ; θ, r)]
= ∂θ ∂r EP [(W ; θ, η0 (θ ) + r(η(θ ) − η0 (θ )))].

(A.2)

Hence,
∂r EP [ψ(W ; θ, η0 + r(η − η0 ))]|r=0 = 0
because
∂r EP [(W ; θ, η0 (θ ) + r(η(θ) − η0 (θ )))]|r=0 = 0,

for all θ ∈

as η0 (θ ) = βθ solves the optimization problem

Here, the regularity conditions are needed to make sure that we can interchange EP and ∂θ and also ∂θ and

Proof of Lemma 2.6: First, we demonstrate that μ0 ∈ L1 (R; Rdθ ×dm ). Indeed,
EP [μ0 (R)] ≤ EP [A(R) (R)−1 ] + EP [G(Z)(R)(R)−1 ]
≤ EP [A(R) × (R)−1 ] + EP [G(Z) × (R) × (R)−1 ]
≤ (EP [A(R)2 ] × EP [(R)−2 ])1/2
+ (EP [G(Z)2 × (R)2 ] × EP [(R)−2 ])1/2 ,
which is finite by assumptions of the lemma as
EP [G(Z)2 × (R)2 ] ≤ (EP [G(Z)4 ] × EP [(R)4 ])1/2 < ∞.
Next, we demonstrate that
EP [ψ(W, θ0 , η)] < ∞

for all η ∈ T .

Indeed, for all η ∈ T , there exist μ ∈ L1 (R; Rdθ ×dm ) and h ∈ H such that η = (μ, h), and so
EP [ψ(W, θ0 , η)] = EP [μ(X)m(W, θ0 , h(Z))]
≤ EP [μ(R) × m(W, θ0 , h(Z))]
= EP [μ(R) × EP [m(W, θ0 , h(Z)) | R]] ≤ Ch E[μ(R)],
which is finite by assumptions of the lemma. Further, (2.1) holds because
EP [ψ(W, θ0 , η0 )] = EP [μ0 (R)m(W, θ0 , h0 (Z))]
= EP [μ0 (R)EP [m(W, θ0 , h0 (Z)) | R]] = 0,

(A.3)

where the last equality follows from (2.22).
Finally, we demonstrate that (2.3) holds. To do so, take any η = (μ, h) ∈ TN = T . Then
EP [ψ(W, θ0 , η0 + r(η − η0 )]
= EP [(μ0 (R) + r(μ(R) − μ0 (R)))m(W, θ0 , h0 (Z) + r(h(Z) − h0 (Z)))],
and so
∂η EP [ψ(W, θ0 , η0 )][η − η0 ] = I1 + I2 ,
where
I1 = EP [(μ(R) − μ0 (R))m(W, θ0 , h0 (Z)],
I2 = EP [μ0 (R)∂v m(W, θ0 , v)|v=h0 (Z) (h(Z) − h0 (Z))].
Here, I1 = 0 by the same argument as that in (A.3) and I2 = 0 because
I2 = EP [μ0 (R)EP [∂v m(W, θ0 , v)|v=h0 (Z) | X](h(Z) − h0 (Z))]
= EP [μ0 (R)(X)(h(Z) − h0 (Z))] = EP [EP [μ0 (R)(R) | Z](h(Z) − h0 (Z))] = 0

calculations. In the proof, it will be convenient to denote by EN the event that η̂0,k ∈ TN for all k ∈ [K].

by the definition of ψ̄ given in the statement of the theorem. In turn, because ρN = o(1), combining
(A.12) with the Lindeberg–Feller central limit theorem (CLT) and the Cramer–Wold device yields
(A.4). To complete the proof of the theorem, it remains to establish the bounds (A.5)–(A.8). We
do so in the following four steps.
S TEP 2. In this step, we establish (A.5). Because K is a fixed integer, which is independent of N ,
it suffices to show that for any k ∈ [K],
En,k [ψ a (W ; η̂0,k )] − EPN [ψ a (W ; η0 )] = OPN (N −1/2 + rN ).

(A.13)

To do so, fix any k ∈ [K] and observe that by the triangle inequality,
En,k [ψ a (W ; η̂0,k )] − EPN [ψ a (W ; η0 )] ≤ I1,k + I2,k ,

(A.14)

where
I1,k := En,k [ψ a (W ; η̂0,k )] − EPN [ψ a (W ; η̂0,k ) | (Wi )i∈Ikc ],
I2,k := EPN [ψ a (W ; η̂0,k ) | (Wi )i∈Ikc ] − EPN [ψ a (W ; η0 )].
To bound I2,k , note that on the event EN , which holds with PN -probability 1 − o(1),
I2,k ≤ sup EPN [ψ a (W ; η)] − EPN [ψ a (W ; η0 )] = rN ,

and so I2,k = OPN (rN ). To bound I1,k , note that conditional on (Wi )i∈Ikc , the estimator η̂0,k is nonstochastic, and so on the event EN ,

where the last inequality holds by Assumption 3.2. Hence, I1,k = OPN (N −1/2 ) by Lemma 6.1.
Combining the bounds I1,k = OPN (N −1/2 ) and I2,k = OPN (rN ) with (A.14) gives (A.13).
S TEP 3. In this step, we establish (A.6). This is the step where we invoke the Neyman orthogonality

introduce the function

Then, by Taylor expansion,
fk (1) = fk (0) + fk (0) + fk (r̃)/2,

for some r̃ ∈ (0, 1).

However, fk (0) = 0 because
EPN [ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 ) | (Wi )i∈Ikc ] = EPN [ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )].
In addition, on the event EN , by the Neyman λN near-orthogonality condition imposed in
Assumption 3.1,
fk (0) = ∂η EPN ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )[η̂0,k − η0 ] ≤ λN .

by Assumption 3.1 and all eigenvalues of EP [ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 ) ] are bounded from below
by c0 by Assumption 3.2. Hence, given that σ −1  is the largest eigenvalue of σ −1 , it follows that

Because N

3.1, it follows from (A.18) that for all k ∈ [K], with PN -probability 1 − o(1), all singular values of Jˆ0,k are
bounded below from zero, and so with the same PN -probability,

θ̌0,k = −Jˆ0,k

Hence, by the same arguments as those in Step 1 in the Proof of Theorem 3.1 (DML2 case), it follows from

In turn, because ρN = o(1), combining (A.22) with the Lindeberg–Feller CLT and the Cramer–Wold device

Proof of Theorem 3.2: In this proof, all bounds hold uniformly in P ∈ PN for N ≥ 3, and we do not
repeat this qualification throughout. Also, the second asserted claim follows immediately from the first one
and Theorem 3.1. Hence, it suffices to prove the first asserted claim.
In the Proof of Theorem 3.1 (DML2 case), we established that Jˆ0 − J0  = OP (rN + N −1/2 ). Hence,
because J0−1  ≤ c0−1 by Assumption 3.1 and
EP [ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 ) ] ≤ EP [ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )2 ] ≤ c12

Moreover, as both K and dθ , the dimension of ψ, are fixed integers, which are independent of N , the last
bound will follow if we show that for all k ∈ [K] and all j, k ∈ [dθ ],
Ikjl := |En,k [ψj (W ; θ̃0 , η̂0,k )ψl (W ; θ̃0 , η̂0,k )] − EP [ψj (W ; θ0 , η0 )ψl (W ; θ0 , η0 )]|
satisfies
Ikjl = OP (N ).

(A.23)

To do so, observe that by the triangle inequality,
Ikjl ≤ Ikjl,1 + Ikjl,2 ,

(A.24)

where
Ikjl,1 := |En,k [ψj (W ; θ̃0 , η̂0,k )ψl (W ; θ̃0 , η̂0,k )] − En,k [ψj (W ; θ0 , η0 )ψl (W ; θ0 , η0 )]|,
Ikjl,2 := |En,k [ψj (W ; θ0 , η0 )ψl (W ; θ0 , η0 )] − EP [ψj (W ; θ0 , η0 )ψl (W ; θ0 , η0 )]|.
We bound Ikjl,2 first. If q ≥ 4, then

where the second line holds by the Hölder inequality, and the third by Assumption 3.2. Hence, Ikjl,2 =

Ikjl,2 = OP (N −[(1−2/q)∧(1/2)] ).

Next, we bound Ikjl,1 . To do so, observe that for any numbers a, b, δa and δb such that |a| ∨ |b| ≤ c and
|δa| ∨ |δb| ≤ r, we have
|(a + δa)(b + δb) − ab| ≤ 2r(c + r).

(A.27)

Combining the bounds (A.25) and (A.27) with (A.24) gives (A.23) and completes the proof of the
theorem.

Proof of Theorem 3.3: We only consider the case of the DML1 estimator and note that the DML2 estimator
can be treated similarly.
With the help of Lemma 6.3, which establishes approximate linearity of the subsample DML estimators
θ̌0,k and is presented below, the proof is the same as that in the linear case presented in the Proof of
Theorem 3.1 (DML1 case).
L EMMA 6.3. (L INEARIZATION FOR SUBSAMPLE DML IN NON-LINEAR PROBLEMS) Under the conditions
of Theorem 3.3, for any k = 1, . . . , K, the estimator θ̌0 = θ̌0,k defined by (3.2) obeys

uniformly over P ∈ PN , where ρn = n−1/2 + rN + rN + n1/2 λN + n1/2 λN  δN and where ψ̄(·) :=
−σ0−1 J0−1 ψ(·, θ0 , η0 ).
Proof: Fix any k = 1, . . . , K and any sequence {PN }N≥1 such that PN ∈ PN for all N ≥ 1. To prove the
asserted claim, it suffices to show that the estimator θ̌0 = θ̌0,k satisfies (A.28) with P replaced by PN . To do
so, we split the proof into four steps. In the proof, we use En , Gn , I and η̂0 instead of En,k , Gn,k , Ik and η̂0,k ,
respectively.
S TEP 1. (Preliminary rate result) We claim that with PN -probability 1 − o(1),
θ̌0 − θ0  ≤ τN .

(A.29)

To show this claim, note that the definition of θ̌0 implies that
En [ψ(W ; θ̌0 , η̂0 )] ≤ En [ψ(W ; θ0 , η̂0 )] + N ,
which in turn implies via the triangle inequality that, with PN -probability 1 − o(1),
EPN [ψ(W ; θ, η0 )]|θ=θ̌0  ≤ N + 2I1 + 2I2 ,

(A.30)

where
I1 :=

sup
θ∈ ,η∈TN

EPN [ψ(W ; θ, η)] − EPN [ψ(W ; θ, η0 )],

I2 := max sup En [ψ(W ; θ, η)] − EPN [ψ(W ; θ, η)].
η∈{η0 ,η̂0 } θ∈

Here N = o(τN ) because N = o(δN N −1/2 ), δN = o(1) and τN ≥ c0 N −1/2 log n. Also, I1 = rN ≤
δN τN = o(τN ) by Assumption 3.4(c). Moreover, applying Lemma 6.2 to the function class F1,η for
η = η0 and η = η̂0 defined in Assumption 3.4, conditional on (Wi )i∈I c and I c , so that η̂0 is fixed
after conditioning, shows that with PN -probability 1 − o(1),
I2  N −1/2 (1 + N −1/2+1/q log n)  N −1/2 = o(τN ).
Hence, it follows from (A.30) and Assumption 3.3 that with PN -probability 1 − o(1),
J0 (θ̌0 − θ0 ) ∧ c0 ≤ EPN [ψ(W ; θ, η0 )]|θ=θ̌0  = o(τN ).

Combining this bound with the fact that the singular values of J0 are bounded away from zero,

(A.34)

where we are using the fact that EPN [ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )]= 0. Finally, by Taylor expansion of the
function r → EPN [ψ(W ; θ0 + r(θ − θ0 ), η0 + r(η − η0 ))], which vanishes at r = 0,

Proof of Theorems 4.1 and 4.2: Because Theorem 4.1 is a special case of Theorem 4.2 (with Z = D), it
suffices to prove the latter. Also, we only consider the DML estimators based on the score (4.7) and note
that the estimators based on the score (4.8) can be treated similarly.
Observe that the score ψ in (4.7) is linear in θ :
ψ(W ; θ, η) = (Y − Dθ − g(X))(Z − m(X)) = ψ a (W ; η)θ + ψ b (W ; η);
ψ a (W ; η) = D(m(X) − Z),

ψ b (W ; η) = (Y − g(X))(Z − m(X)).

Therefore, all asserted claims of Theorem 4.2 follow from Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 and Corollary 3.1 as
long as we can verify Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2, which we do here. We do so with TN being the set of all
η = (g, m) consisting of P -square-integrable functions g and m such that
η − η0 P ,q ≤ C,
η − η0 P ,2 ≤ δN ,
m − m0 P ,2 × g − g0 P ,2 ≤ δN N −1/2 .
Also, we replace the
√ constant q and the sequence (δN )N≥1 in Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2 by q/2 and (δN )N≥1
with δN = (C + 2 C + 2)(δN ∨ N −((1−4/q)∧(1/2)) ) for all N (recall that we assume that q > 4, and the
analysis in Section 3 only requires that q > 2; also, δN satisfies δN ≥ N −1/2 , which is required in Theorems
3.1 and 3.2). We proceed in five steps. All bounds in the proof hold uniformly over P ∈ P but we omit this
qualifier for brevity).
S TEP 1. We first verify Neyman orthogonality. We have that EP [ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )] = 0 by definition
of θ0 of η0 . Also, for any η = (g, m) ∈ TN , the Gateaux derivative in the direction η − η0 = (g −
g0 , m − m0 ) is given by
∂η EP [ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )][η − η0 ] = EP [(g(X) − g0 (X))(m0 (X) − Z)]
+EP [(m0 (X) − m(X))(Y − Dθ0 − g0 (X))] = 0,
by the law of iterated expectations, as V = Z − m0 (X) and U = (Y − Dθ0 − g0 (X)) obey
EP [V |X] = 0 and EP [U |Z, X] = 0. This gives Assumption 3.1(d) with λN = 0.
S TEP 2. Note that
|J0 | = |EP [ψ a (W ; η0 )]| = |EP [D(m0 (X) − Z)]| = |EP [DV ]| ≥ c > 0
by Assumption 4.2(c). In addition,
|EP [ψ a (W ; η0 )]| = |EP [D(m0 (X) − Z)]| ≤ DP ,2 m0 (X)P ,2 + DP ,2 ZP ,2
≤ 2DP ,2 ZP ,2 ≤ 2DP ,q ZP ,q ≤ 2C 2
by the triangle inequality, the Hölder inequality, the Jensen inequality and Assumption 4.2(b). This
gives Assumption 3.1(e). Hence, given that Assumptions 3.1(a)–(c) hold trivially, Steps 1 and 2
together show that all conditions of Assumption 3.1 hold.
S TEP 3. Note that Assumption 3.2(a) holds by construction of the set TN and Assumption 4.2(e).
Also, note that ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 ) = U V , and so
EP [ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 ) ] = EP [U 2 V 2 ] ≥ c4 > 0,
by Assumption 4.2(c), which gives Assumption 3.2(d).
S TEP 4. Here we verify Assumption 3.2(b). For any η = (g, m) ∈ TN , we have
(EP [ψ a (W ; η)q/2 ])2/q = ψ a (W ; η)P ,q/2 = D(m(X) − Z)P ,q/2

by Assumption 4.2(c), it follows that θ0 satisfies

where we used the fact that because g0 (X) = EP [Y − Dθ0 | X], g0 (X)P ,q ≤ Y − Dθ0 P ,q by
the Jensen inequality. This gives the bound on mN in Assumption 3.2(b). Hence, Assumption

which gives the bound on rN in Assumption 3.2(c). Finally, let
f (r) := EP [ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 + r(η − η0 )],

r ∈ (0, 1).

Then, for any r ∈ (0, 1),
f (r) = EP [(U − r(g(X) − g0 (X)))(V − r(m(X) − m0 (X)))],
and so
∂f (r) = −EP [(g(X) − g0 (X))(V − r(m(X) − m0 (X)))]
−EP [(U − r(g(X) − g0 (X)))(m(X) − m0 (X))],
∂ f (r) = 2EP [(g(X) − g0 (X))(m(X) − m0 (X))].

Hence,
|∂ 2 f (r)| ≤ 2g(X) − g0 (X)P ,2 × m(X) − m0 (X)P ,2 ≤ 2δN N −1/2 ≤ δN N −1/2 ,
which gives the bound on λN in Assumption 3.2(c). Thus, all conditions of Assumptions 3.1 are
verified. This completes the proof.

Proof of Theorems 5.1 and 5.2: The proof of Theorem 5.2 is similar to that of Theorem 5.1 and is therefore
omitted. In turn, regarding Theorem 5.1, we show the proof for the case of ATE and note that the proof for
the case of ATTE is similar.
Observe that the score ψ in (5.3) is linear in θ:
ψ(W ; θ, η) = ψ a (W ; η)θ + ψ b (W ; η),
ψ b (W ; η) = (g(1, X) − g(0, X)) +

ψ a (W ; η) = −1,

1 − m(X)

Therefore, all asserted claims of Theorem 5.1 follow from Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 and Corollary 3.1 as
long as we can verify Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2, which we do here. We do so with TN being the set of all
η = (g, m) consisting of P -square-integrable functions g and m such that
η − η0 P ,q ≤ C,
η − η0 P ,2 ≤ δN ,
m − 1/2P ,∞ ≤ 1/2 − ε;
m − m0 P ,2 × g − g0 P ,2 ≤ δN N −1/2 .
Also, we replace the sequence (δN )N≥1 in Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2 by (δN )N≥1 with δN = Cε (δN ∨
N −((1−4/q)∧(1/2)) ) for all N , where Cε is a sufficiently large constant that depends only on ε and C (note
that δN satisfies δN ≥ N −((1−4/q)∧(1/2)) , which is required in Theorems 3.1 and 3.2). We proceed in five steps.
All bounds in the proof hold uniformly over P ∈ P but we omit this qualifier for brevity.
S TEP 1. We first verify Neyman orthogonality. We have that E[ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )] = 0 by definition
of θ0 and η0 . Also, for any η = (g, m) ∈ TN , the Gateaux derivative in the direction η − η0 =
(g − g0 , m − m0 ) is given by
∂η EP [ψ(W ; θ0 , η0 )][η − η0 ] = EP [g(1, X) − g0 (1, X)] − EP [g(0, X) − g0 (0, X)]

which is 0 by the law of iterated expectations, as

EP [1 − D | X] = 1 − m0 (X),
EP [(1 − D)(Y − g0 (0, X)) | X] = 0.

This gives Assumption 3.1(d) with λN = 0.
S TEP 2. Note that J0 = −1, and so Assumption 3.1(e) holds trivially. Hence, given that
Assumptions 3.1(a)–(c) hold trivially as well, Steps 1 and 2 together show that all conditions
of Assumption 3.1 hold.
S TEP 3. Note that Assumption 3.2(a) holds by construction of the set TN and Assumption 5.1(f).

This gives Assumption 3.2(d).
S TEP 4. Here we verify Assumption 3.2(b). We have

≥ (EP [|g0 (1, X)|q P r P (D = 1 | X) + |g0 (0, X)|q P r P (D = 0 | X)])1/q

≥ ε1/q (g0 (1, X)P ,q ∨ g0 (0, X)P ,q ),
where in the third line, we used the facts that PrP (D = 1 | X) = m0 (X) ≥ ε and P r P (D = 0 |
X) = 1 − m0 (X) ≥ ε. Hence, given that g0 (D, X)P ,q ≤ Y P ,q ≤ C by the Jensen inequality
and Assumption 5.1(b), it follows that
g0 (1, X)P ,q ≤ C/ε1/q

and

g0 (0, X)P ,q ≤ C/ε1/q .

and

g(0, X) − g0 (0, X)P ,q ≤ C/ε1/q

Similarly, for any η ∈ (g, m) ∈ TN ,
g(1, X) − g0 (1, X)P ,q ≤ C/ε1/q

|θ0 | = |EP [g0 (1, X) − g0 (0, X)]| ≤ g0 (1, X)P ,2 + g0 (0, X)P ,2 ≤ 2C/ε1/q .

This gives the bound on mN in Assumption 3.2(b). Also, we have
(EP [|ψ a (W ; η)|q ])1/q = 1.
This gives the bound on mN in Assumption 3.2(b). Hence, Assumption 3.2(b) holds.
S TEP 5. Finally, we verify Assumption 3.2(c). For any η = (g, m) ∈ TN , we have
EP [ψ a (W ; η) − ψ a (W ; η0 )] = |1 − 1| = 0 ≤ δN ,
which gives the bound on rN in Assumption 3.2(c). Further, by the triangle inequality,

and

g(0, X) − g0 (0, X)P ,2 ≤ δN /ε1/2 , (A.38)

and so I1 ≤ 2δN /ε1/2 . To bound I2 , we have
I2 ≤ ε−2 Dm0 (X)(Y − g(1, X)) − Dm(X)(Y − g0 (1, X))P ,2
≤ ε−2 m0 (X)(g0 (1, X) + U − g(1, X)) − m(X)U P ,2

Here, the first inequality follows from the bounds ε ≤ m0 (X) ≤ 1 − ε and ε ≤ m(X) ≤ 1 − ε,

as long as Cε in the definition of δN satisfies Cε ≥ 2(ε−1/2 + ε−5/2 + Cε−2 ). This gives the bound

Finally, let

r ∈ (0, 1).

(1 − D)(Y − g0 (0, X)) = (1 − D)U,
|m(X) − m0 (X)| ≤ 2,

it follows that for some constant Cε that depends only on ε and C,
|∂ 2 f (r)| ≤ Cε m − m0 P ,2 × g − g0 P ,2 ≤ δN N −1/2 ,
as long as the constant Cε in the definition of δN satisfies Cε ≥ Cε . This gives the bound on λN
in Assumption 3.2(c). Thus, all conditions of Assumptions 3.1 are verified. This completes the
proof.
