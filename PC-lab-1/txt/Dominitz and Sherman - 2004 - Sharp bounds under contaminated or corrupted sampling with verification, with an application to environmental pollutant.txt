Sharp Bounds Under Contaminated or
Corrupted Sampling With Veriﬁcation,
With an Application to
Environmental Pollutant Data
Jeff DOMINITZ and Robert P. SHERMAN
Let F denote a distribution of interest and G a possibly spurious distribution. This
article derives and nonparametrically estimates sharp bounds on characteristics of F when
the data are a mixture of F and G, and a fraction of the data is veriﬁed to be from F . Contaminated and corrupted mixtures, with and without monotonicity restrictions, are analyzed.
The methods are particularly useful in analyzing environmental pollutant measurements obtained using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Results are applied to measurements
of organic pollutant concentrations from the Love Canal. We argue that a corruption with
monotonic veriﬁcation model may be the most appropriate model for this type of data.
Key Words: Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy; Mixture models.

1. INTRODUCTION
It is often reasonable, in practice, to assume that data are generated according to a
mixture model, where each observation is selected from either a distribution of interest,
say F , or another, possibly spurious distribution, say G. If selection is independent of the
value drawn from F , the data are said to be contaminated. Otherwise, the data are said to
be corrupted, a more serious deﬁciency. In either case, unless untestable assumptions about
the data-generating process hold, it is not possible to identify characteristics of F such as
moments, probabilities, and quantiles. However, given a lower bound on the probability
of selection from F , Horowitz and Manski (1995) identiﬁed sharp bounds on such characteristics under either contaminated or corrupted sampling. (Bounds are sharp if they are
attainable under the maintained assumptions about the data-generating mechanism.) They
also show how to nonparametrically estimate these bounds.

Sometimes there is more information than simply a lower bound on the probability of
selection from F . Sometimes a subset of the sample is veriﬁed to be drawn from F . We say
that data generated in this way come from a mixture model with veriﬁcation.
Mixture models with veriﬁcation can be used to model many interesting data problems. See Dominitz and Sherman (2004) for an application to school test score data where
a signiﬁcant proportion of students are classiﬁed as having limited English language skills.
A discussion is also given of applications to data on self-reported income partially supplemented with administrative records, missing data problems, and treatment effects with
partially missing treatments. In each of these examples, it is reasonable to assume that a
fraction of the data is drawn from a distribution of interest, while the rest of the data may
or may not be drawn from this distribution.
The application guiding the methodological development in this article concerns the
analysis of measurements of organic pollutant concentrations using gas chromatography
and mass spectroscopy. This application was previously considered by Lambert and Tierney (1997), who analyzed measurements obtained from the Love Canal in upstate New
York in 1988. The Love Canal was the site of a major environmental disaster.
As discussed by Lambert and Tierney (1997), a gas chromatograph (GC) is supposed
to isolate a pollutant of interest from an environmental sample containing many chemical
compounds. Because the GC sometimes isolates the wrong pollutant, a mass spectrometer
(MS) is used to test whether an isolated compound is the right pollutant. The MS also
measures the pollutant concentration. The distribution of interest, F , is the distribution of
concentrations from the right pollutant. Problems arise because veriﬁcation is partial and
may depend on concentration level. Chemists believe that veriﬁed concentrations are from
F , but unveriﬁed concentrations may or may not be from F . Moreover, it is believed that
lower concentrations from F are likely to be harder to verify than higher concentrations.
Thus, there may be information on F in the unveriﬁed measurements, while the veriﬁed
measurements may not be a random sample from F .
Lambert and Tierney (1997) derived sharp bounds on a general functional of F under
a contamination with veriﬁcation model (they did not use this terminology). They proposed
a nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation procedure and applied this procedure to
estimate bounds on mean concentrations of organic pollutants extracted from the Love
Canal. Their procedure involves nonparametric estimation of the conditional probability of
veriﬁcation given the level of pollution concentration. Because of this, the procedure has
difﬁculty handling the censoring that occurs in the Love Canal data at very low pollution
concentrations. Nor can it naturally incorporate the plausible monotonicity condition mentioned above. The authors called for extensions that could better handle censoring as well as
continuous covariates. Their methods do not allow for corruption in the sampling process.
In this article, we derive and nonparametrically estimate sharp bounds on characteristics of F under contaminated or corrupted sampling with veriﬁcation. Our approach to
establishing bounds is an extension of the approach used by Horowitz and Manski (1995)
and is quite different from the approach taken by Lambert and Tierney (1997). This leads to
nonparametric estimation procedures that are more direct than the procedure of Lambert and

SHARP BOUNDS UNDER CONTAMINATED OR CORRUPTED SAMPLING

Tierney (1997). Our procedures do not require nonparametric estimation of the conditional
probability of veriﬁcation given the level of pollution concentration. As such, they can easily
and naturally handle the censoring in the Love Canal data as well as incorporate plausible
monotonicity conditions. Our procedures can also be extended in a straightforward way to
handle continuous covariates. Perhaps most importantly, as mentioned above, we allow for
corruption in the data generating process. We show that under an additional monotonicity
condition that is likely to hold for measurements obtained using gas-chromatography-mass
spectroscopy in general and the Love Canal data in particular, the contamination with veriﬁcation model is invalid. We argue, therefore, that a corruption with veriﬁcation model
incorporating all plausible monotonicity conditions may be a more appropriate model for
this type of data. Moreover, we show for the Love Canal data that inferences based on such
a corruption model can be substantively different from those based on the corresponding
contamination model.
The rest of the article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formally deﬁne a
general mixture model with veriﬁcation, and present and discuss the assumptions under
which we derive sharp bounds on various characteristics of F . In Section 3, we derive sharp
bounds on characteristics of F under both corruption and contamination with veriﬁcation,
incorporating censoring and plausible monotonicity restrictions. Section 4 deﬁnes sample
analogs of the population bounds derived in Section 3 and discusses some of their asymptotic
properties. We also discuss some of the beneﬁts derived from convexity and concavity of
the functions deﬁning the contamination with veriﬁcation bounds, as well as extensions to
handle continuous regressors. In Section 5, we apply our methods to the Love Canal data
and discuss substantive ﬁndings. Section 6 summarizes. Proofs are given in the Appendix.

2. MIXTURE MODELS WITH VERIFICATION
In this section, we formally deﬁne a mixture model with veriﬁcation, and state and
discuss assumptions that characterize interesting submodels for which we derive sharp
bounds on various functionals of the distribution of interest, such as expectations, quantiles,
and probabilities. We relate all deﬁnitions to the Love Canal example discussed in the
introduction and analyzed in detail in Section 5. Recall that GC and MS stand for gas
chromatograph and mass spectrometer, respectively.
Let Y1 denote an outcome of interest with distribution F . In a mixture model, one
observes Y , a mixture of Y1 and another random variable Y0 , where G, the distribution of
Y0 , may be quite different from F . Let Z denote a selection indicator. If Z = 1, then Y is
drawn from F . If Z = 0, then Y is drawn from G. That is,
Y = Y1 Z + Y0 (1 − Z) .

(2.1)

Finally, let V denote an observed veriﬁcation indicator. If V = 1, then Y is veriﬁed to be
drawn from F . If V = 0, then Y may be drawn from either F or G. For the Love Canal
data, Y1 denotes an organic pollution concentration of interest, Z = 1 if the GC isolates the
pollutant of interest, and V = 1 if the MS veriﬁcation test is passed.

In order to handle response censoring of the form encountered in the Love Canal
example, suppose Y ≥ α where α is known and c ≥ α is a known censoring point. We
consider a situation where Y may or may not be censored if its value lies between α and c.
This is the situation governing the Love Canal data, where Y is a chemical concentration
measured in parts per billion, α = 0, and c = 0.2 parts per billion. Some concentration
levels are observed in the range [0, 0.2], while for others, all that is known is that they fall
in this interval. Deﬁne
Y

=

Y {Y is observed} + α{Y is censored}

Y

=

Y {Y is observed} + c{Y is censored} .

Note that both Y and Y are observed and the case c = α corresponds to no response
censoring. Also, note that these deﬁnitions nest the standard case of response censoring
below a known censoring point, where Y is always censored if it falls below the censoring
point.
In sum, in a mixture model with veriﬁcation and possible response censoring, each
member of the sampling distribution is characterized by a vector (Y , Y , V, Z, Y1 , Y0 ), where
Y , Y , and V are observed. A vector of covariates may also be observed, but we do not
formally consider this possibility in this article.
Let M denote a known, real-valued function on the support of Y1 . Our objective is to
derive sharp bounds on IEM (Y1 ). By choosing M (s) = sk , we can obtain sharp bounds
on arbitrary moments of F . By choosing M (s) = {s ≤ t} for t ∈ IR we can obtain sharp
bounds on the cumulative distribution function F (t), which can be inverted to get sharp
bounds on arbitrary quantiles of F .
We shall select from the following assumptions to deﬁne interesting submodels of the
basic mixture model with veriﬁcation.
A1.
A2.
A3.
A4.

IP {V = 1} > 0.
IP {Z = 1 | V = 1} = 1.
IEM (Y1 ) = IE[M (Y1 ) | Z = 1].
IE[M (Y1 ) | V = 1] ≥ IE[M (Y1 ) | V = 0].

Assumption A1 says that the probability of veriﬁcation is positive. By A2, all the veriﬁed
data are from F . Assumptions A1 and A2 characterize the least restrictive corruption with
veriﬁcation model that we study in this article. These are reasonable assumptions for the
Love Canal data.
Assumption A3 is a mean independence assumption. Assumptions A1, A2, and A3
characterize the least restrictive contamination with veriﬁcation model that we study here.
Notice that A3 follows from the following stronger independence assumption:
B3. Z is independent of Y1 .
Assumption B3 says that selection is independent of the value drawn from F . Lambert
and Tierney (1997) assumed B3 in establishing their contamination with veriﬁcation bounds.
We get the same sharp bounds whether we assume A3 or B3.

SHARP BOUNDS UNDER CONTAMINATED OR CORRUPTED SAMPLING

323

Assumption A4 is a monotonicity restriction that can be placed on either the basic
corruption with veriﬁcation model or the basic contamination with veriﬁcation model to
tighten bounds on functionals of F . Lemma 1 in the Appendix (p. 336) shows that if M is
increasing, then A4 follows from A1, A2, and the following monotonicity conditions:
B4. IP {V = 1 | Z = 1, Y1 = y} is increasing in y;
B4 . IP {Z = 1 | Y1 = y} is increasing in y.
In their analysis of the Love Canal data, Lambert and Tierney (1997) assumed a contamination with veriﬁcation model and imposed monotonicity restriction B4, which allows
that smaller concentrations of the pollutant of interest are likely to be harder to verify
than larger concentrations. In short, they assumed a contamination with veriﬁcation model
characterized by assumptions A1, A2, B3, and B4.
It may also be reasonable to assume that smaller concentrations of the pollutant of
interest are likely to be harder to isolate than larger concentrations. (We learned of the
plausibility of this assumption through discussions about GC-MS technology with Nathan
Dalleska, Director of the Environmental Analysis Center at the California Institute of Technology.) Assumption B4 formally allows for this. Notice that if B4 holds nontrivially, then
B3 cannot hold, whereas A1, A2, B4, and B4 imply A4. Thus, a corruption with veriﬁcation
model under assumptions A1, A2, and A4 may be a more appropriate model for the Love
Canal data than a contamination with veriﬁcation model under assumptions A1, A2, B3,
and B4. We return to this consideration in Section 5.

3. SHARP BOUNDS
In this section, we derive sharp bounds on IEM (Y1 ) for various choices of M and for
various mixture models with veriﬁcation. We allow response censoring of the form deﬁned
in Section 2.
We begin with the basic corruption with veriﬁcation model characterized by assumptions A1 and A2. Let M be a known, real-valued function on IR, and suppose the support of M (Y1 ) is contained in the interval [a, b], where a and b are known and satisfy
−∞ < a < b < ∞. For the Love Canal data, when M (s) = s, a = 0 and b = 109 . When
M (s) = {s ≤ t}, a = 0 and b = 1. Write v for IP {V = 1}.
Theorem 1. If A1 and A2 hold, then λ1 ≤ IEM (Y1 ) ≤ u1 where
λ1

=

IE[M (Y ) | V = 1]v + a(1 − v)

u1

=

IE[M (Y ) | V = 1]v + b(1 − v) .

Moreover, these bounds are sharp.
Next, we consider adding the monotonicity restriction A4 to the basic corruption with
veriﬁcation model. This restriction can have considerable identifying power in applications
where there is a very large upper bound on M (Y1 ), as is the case with the Love Canal data,
where b = 109 when M (s) = s.

Theorem 2. If A1, A2, and A4 hold, then λ2 ≤ IEM (Y1 ) ≤ u2 where
λ2

=

λ1

u2

=

IE[M (Y ) | V = 1] .

Moreover, these bounds are sharp.
Remark 1. If the sense of the inequality in A4 is reversed, then it is easy to show that
λ2 = IE[M (Y ) | V = 1] and u2 = u1 are sharp bounds on IEM (Y1 ).
Next, we consider the basic contamination with veriﬁcation model characterized by
assumptions A1, A2, and A3, and assume that M is increasing. For ease of exposition, we
also assume that Y is continuously distributed (as it is for the Love Canal data).
By A3, IEM (Y1 ) = IE[M (Y1 ) | Z = 1] = IE[M (Y ) | Z = 1]. It follows from A1
and A2 that IE[M (Y ) | Z = 1, V = 1] = IE[M (Y ) | V = 1]. Write p∗ for IP {V = 1 |
Z = 1}. Then
IEM (Y1 ) = IE[M (Y ) | V = 1]p∗ + IE[M (Y ) | Z = 1, V = 0](1 − p∗ ) .

(3.1)

If we can ﬁnd a lower bound on IP {Z = 1 | V = 0}, then we can apply Proposition 4 in
Horowitz and Manski (1995) to bound IE[M (Y ) | Z = 1, V = 0], which, in turn, will lead
to bounds on IEM (Y1 ) in (3.1).
To this end, let π(p∗ ) = IP {Z = 1 | V = 0}. Recall that v = IP {V = 1}. A1, A2,
and Bayes’ rule imply that π(p∗ ) = [(1 − p∗ )v]/[p∗ (1 − v)]. Recall the deﬁnitions of Y
and Y given in Section 2. Let U denote a U [0, 1] random variable independent of Y . Deﬁne
Y

=

(α + U ){Y is censored} + (Y + 1){Y is observed}

Y

=

Y {Y is observed, Y < c} + (c + U ){Y is censored}
+(Y + 1){Y is observed, Y > c} .

Note that Y and Y are continuous analogues of Y and Y , respectively. Write Q for the
population quantile function of Y given V = 0 and Q for the population quantile function
of Y given V = 0. By Proposition 4 in Horowitz and Manski (1995), the interval


(3.2)
IE[M (Y ) | Y ≤ Q(π(p∗ )), V = 0], IE[M (Y ) | Y > Q(1 − π(p∗ )), V = 0]
contains IE[M (Y ) | Z = 1, V = 0]. Combining (3.2) with (3.1) produces bounds on
IEM (Y1 ). However, these bounds are infeasible because p∗ is unknown.
To develop feasible bounds, ﬁrst note that v ≤ p∗ ≤ 1. This follows from A1, A2, and
Bayes’ rule. For each p ∈ [v, 1], deﬁne π(p) = [(1 − p)v]/[p(1 − v)]. Deﬁne lower and
upper bound functions
L(p)

= pIE[M (Y ) | V = 1] + (1 − p)IE[M (Y ) | Y ≤ Q(π(p)), V = 0]

U (p)

= pIE[M (Y ) | V = 1] + (1 − p)IE[M (Y ) | Y > Q(1 − π(p)), V = 0] .

This leads to the following result.

SHARP BOUNDS UNDER CONTAMINATED OR CORRUPTED SAMPLING

Theorem 3. If A1, A2, and A3 hold, then λ3 ≤ IEM (Y1 ) ≤ u3 where
λ3

=

u3

p∈[v,1]

p∈[v,1]

Moreover, these bounds are sharp.
Next, we consider the effect of imposing the monotonicity assumption A4 on the basic
contamination model.
Theorem 4. If A1, A2, A3, and A4 hold, then λ4 ≤ IEM (Y1 ) ≤ u4 where
λ4

=

λ3

u4

=

IE[M (Y ) | V = 1] .

Moreover, these bounds are sharp.
Remark 2. Note that u2 = u4 . That is, imposing A4 leads to the same upper bound
under either corruption with veriﬁcation or contamination with veriﬁcation. As before, if
the sense of the inequality in A4 is reversed, then λ4 = IE[M (Y ) | V = 1] and u4 = u3
are sharp bounds on IEM (Y1 ).

4. ESTIMATION
In this section, we develop sample analogs of the population bounds for the mixture
models with veriﬁcation developed in Section 3. We also discuss some of their asymptotic
properties, some of the beneﬁts derived from convexity and concavity of the functions
deﬁning the contamination with veriﬁcation bounds, and extensions covering continuous
regressors.
We begin by developing sample analogues of the corruption with veriﬁcation bounds
established in Section 3. Let (Y i , Y i , Vi , Zi , Y1i , Y0i ), i = 1, . . . , n, denote iid draws from
n

A straightforward application of the delta method shows that all the estimators deﬁned

above are n-consistent estimators of their population counterparts and asymptotically
normally distributed.
Next, we develop sample analogues of the contamination with veriﬁcation bounds
established in Section 3. Deﬁne n0 = n − n1 and π̂(p) = [(1 − p)v̂]/[p(1 − v̂)]. Recall
the deﬁnitions of Y and Y given in Section 3. Let Y i and Y i , i = 1, . . . , n, denote the
corresponding sample quantities. Write Q̂ for the empirical quantile function of the Y i ’s

Arguments in Sherman (2003) show that if Y is bounded (as it is in the Love Canal
√
example), then λ̂3 and û3 are n-consistent estimators of their population counterparts.
The presence of the empirical quantile functions in the indicator function factors of the
summands comprising L̂(p) and Û (p) makes establishing the limiting distribution of λ̂3
and û3 a difﬁcult task. Dominitz and Sherman (2004) showed that estimators analogous to
λ̂3 and û3 are asymptotically normally distributed when Y has a ﬁnite number of support
points. Their arguments do not apply to estimators based on the Love Canal data, where
Y and Y are mixtures of a continuous response and a point mass at a censoring threshold.
We leave for future work the establishment of the limiting distribution of these estimators
when the response is continuously distributed or a mixture of a continuous and discrete
distribution.

SHARP BOUNDS UNDER CONTAMINATED OR CORRUPTED SAMPLING

327

Arguments in Dominitz and Sherman (2004) can be adapted to show that L̂(p) is a
piecewise linear convex function and Û (p) is a piecewise linear concave function on [v̂, 1].
Moreover, the ordinates of the n possible kink points of L̂(p) are given by π̂ −1 (Ĥ(yi )),
i = 1, . . . , n, where π̂ −1 (p) = v̂/[v̂ + p(1 − v̂)], Ĥ is the empirical distribution function of
the Y i ’s, and yi , i = 1, . . . , n are the realized values of the Y i ’s. Similarly, the ordinates of
ˆ
ˆ
the n possible kink points of Û (p) are given by π̂ −1 (1 − H(y
i )), i = 1, . . . , n, where H is
the empirical distribution function of the Y i ’s, and yi , i = 1, . . . , n are the realized values
of the Y i ’s. Thus, to ﬁnd λ̂3 or û3 , it is sufﬁcient to evaluate the corresponding criterion
functions at the corresponding ordinates, which are computable. However, because L̂(p)
is convex and Û (p) is concave, a binary search over the corresponding ordinates will ﬁnd
λ̂3 and u3 after only O(log n) function evaluations. This can result in substantial savings
in computation time when (1) n is large, (2) bootstrap estimates of the distribution of the
extreme value estimators are desired, or (3) the response depends on a vector of regressors,
and it is desirable to evaluate the extreme value estimators for many regressor values (see
below).
Finally, we note that the estimation procedures developed in this section apply immediately to the situation where the response variable Y depends on a vector of discrete
regressors, X. One simply restricts attention to the subset of the data corresponding to a
possible value of X and proceeds as prescribed in this section. This is illustrated in the Love
Canal example analyzed in Section 5, where six different labs analyze randomly drawn soil
samples from the Love Canal and comparison regions. In this example, X denotes lab and
can take on one of six possible values.
The extension to the situation where X has continuous components is straightforward.
One simply replaces all sample averages deﬁned in this section with standard nonparametric regression analogs. Sherman (2003) showed how and developed primitive conditions
implying convergence of the extreme value estimators at rate n−2/[d+4] , where d is the
number of continuous components of X. Conditions implying asymptotic normality of the
corruption with veriﬁcation extreme value estimators are also developed.

5. AN EXAMPLE: THE LOVE CANAL STUDY
In this section, we illustrate the usefulness of our results on corruption and contamination with veriﬁcation by reanalyzing data on environmental pollutants 2-chloronapthalene
(2-CNAP) and α-BHC in both the Love Canal and a comparison region. These data were
previously analyzed by Lambert and Tierney (1997).
As described by Lambert and Tierney, the measurement and veriﬁcation process for
each compound proceeded as follows. Soil samples were collected from a number of randomly selected locations in the Love Canal and in a comparison region. Samples were then
randomly assigned to labs for pollutant analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy.
The gas chromatograph was used to attempt to isolate the pollutant of interest. The mass
spectrometer was used to ionize the isolated compound and then (1) verify that the compound was the pollutant of interest and (2) measure the concentration of the most abundant

328

ion. The veriﬁcation procedure yielded reports of either veriﬁed (V = 1) or not veriﬁed
(V = 0). At each lab, a positive fraction was veriﬁed, and so assumption A1 holds.
According to Lambert and Tierney (1997), “Chemists believe that all of the veriﬁed
GC-MS measurements belong to the pollutant of interest, but unveriﬁed GC-MS measurements may or may not belong to the pollutant” (p. 937). If this statement is correct, then
A2 holds. Lambert and Tierney further assumed B3, that isolation of the compound is independent of its concentration. They also asserted the plausibility of assumption B4, that
the probability of veriﬁcation when the correct pollutant has been isolated is increasing in
the concentration level. Assumptions A1, A2, and B3 characterize their contamination with
veriﬁcation model. Assumptions A1, A2, B3, and B4 characterize their contamination with
monotonic veriﬁcation model. (In this article, we characterize contamination with veriﬁcation with the weaker set A1, A2, and A3, and contamination with monotonic veriﬁcation
with the set A1, A2, A3, and A4.)
As discussed at the end of Section 2, it may also be reasonable to assume B4 , that the
probability of isolation is increasing in the concentration level. If B4 holds nontrivially, then
B3 cannot hold. This calls into question a model based on B3 and suggests that a corruption
with monotonic veriﬁcation model characterized by assumptions A1, A2, and A4 (recall
from Section 2 that A4 follows from A1, A2, B4, and B4 ) may be more appropriate for this
data. Moreover, in this section, we show that corruption with monotonic veriﬁcation bounds
can lead to inferences about pollution concentrations that are substantively different from
inferences based on contamination with monotonic veriﬁcation bounds. This underscores
the need for corruption with veriﬁcation bounds.
We also note that, unlike the estimator proposed in Section 4 for the contamination with
veriﬁcation model, the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator derived by Lambert
and Tierney (1997) requires kernel smoothing even in the absence of continuous covariates.
This approach does not allow them to easily handle the response censoring that is present
in the Love Canal data or to add continuous covariates to the analysis. In addition, Lambert
and Tierney’s approach can only incorporate assumption B4 in estimation with an “ad hoc”
adjustment requiring that an “unveriﬁed measurement is tied with [equal to] the smallest
veriﬁed measurement” (p. 940). We shall illustrate the identifying power of assumptions
A3 and A4 and the ease with which these assumptions and censoring can be incorporated
into our estimation procedure.
Measurements were reported in parts per billion (ppb). However, when unveriﬁed
measurements were below 0.2 ppb, the protocol allowed the lab to simply report “less than
0.2 ppb.” Unlike the approach taken by Lambert and Tierney, our bounds easily incorporate
such censoring. Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the data produced by each of six
labs, as well as for the aggregated data. Note that bounds on the sample means of measured
concentrations are reported when some observed values are censored. These bounds are
obtained by assigning to each censored observation the lower limit value 0.00 to calculate
the lower bound and the upper limit value 0.20 to calculate the upper bound.
Several other features of the table are noteworthy. The proportion of veriﬁed measurements n1 /n = v̂ varies greatly across labs, ranging from 0.32 to 0.97 for 2-CNAP and

the veriﬁed measurements (see Remarks 1 and 2).

from 0.29 to 0.87 for α-BHC. The proportion censored among the unveriﬁed also varies
greatly, ranging 0.00 to 0.50 for 2-CNAP and from 0.00 to 0.86 for α-BHC. Note that not
all unveriﬁed values below 0.2 are censored. For α-BHC, the veriﬁed measurements tend
to be much larger than the unveriﬁed measurements, but this relationship is not clear for
2-CNAP, which has mean veriﬁed concentration levels below the censoring value c = 0.2
at each lab.
Consider now estimates of the distribution of 2-CNAP concentration in Love Canal
using data for all labs combined. Let M (Y1 ) = {Y1 ≤ t} for t ∈ R. Figure 1 presents
our estimates of the corruption and contamination bounds with monotonic veriﬁcation for
a ﬁne grid of values of t on the interval [0, 0.3]; that is, estimated bounds on the cumulative
distribution function (cdf) over this interval. Note that since M (Y1 ) = {Y1 ≤ t} is monotone
decreasing, the direction of the inequality in A4 is reversed, and so this assumption affects
the lower bounds rather than the upper bounds. That is, λ̂1 ≤ λ̂2 and λ̂3 ≤ λ̂4 , but û1 = û2
and û3 = û4 (see Remark 1 and Remark 2 in Section 3).
We see that the lower bounds coincide (i.e., λ̂2 = λ̂4 ) and the corruption upper bounds
û2 exceed the contamination upper bounds û4 . For example, the bounds on P {Y1 ≤ 0.070}
are [0.44, 0.60] under corruption versus [0.44, 0.54] under contamination. Note also that the
lower bound on P {Y1 ≤ 0} equals 0.00 under either corruption or contamination, because
all measurements that may equal 0 are unveriﬁed censored values, so it may be that there are

SHARP BOUNDS UNDER CONTAMINATED OR CORRUPTED SAMPLING

no true zero concentrations of 2-CNAP. In contrast, the corruption upper bound at t = 0 is
û2 = 1 − υ̂ = 0.28. The contamination upper bound at t = 0 is just û4 = 0.02. The vertical
distance between the estimated upper bounds on the cdf is an indicator of the identifying
power of assumption A3. This distance is maximized at t = 0 and decreases monotonically
with t.
Note also that we may invert the bounds on the cdf to obtain bounds on quantiles.
For instance, the bounds on the median of Y1 are [0.055, 0.078] under corruption versus
[0.066, 0.078] under contamination. Note that the endpoints of these intervals are the ordinates of the points of intersection of the estimated cdfs and the horizontal line through
0.50 in Figure 1. We also report these values in the upper-right panel of Table 2, along
with estimates of joint 90%-conﬁdence intervals based on 100 bootstrap estimates (λ̂∗ , û∗ ).
Following Horowitz and Manski (2000), the estimated intervals are obtained by ﬁnding the
smallest value z ∗ such that Pr(λ̂∗ − z ∗ ≤ λ̂, û ≤ û∗ ) = 0.90. The estimated conﬁdence
intervals for bounds on the population median of Y1 are [0.049, 0.084] and [0.061, 0.084]
under corruption with monotonic veriﬁcation and contamination with monotonic veriﬁcation, respectively. Thus, maintaining assumption A3 reduces the width of the point estimate
of the bounds on the median by almost one-half and the width of the conﬁdence interval by
over one-third.
Figure 2(a) illustrates the calculation of contamination bounds on the mean concentration of 2-CNAP in Love Canal, based on Lab 2 measurements. Figure 2(b) uses Lab 6
measurements. The pictures appear different because Lab 2 has no censored observations,
whereas 6.5 percent of the Lab 6 unveriﬁed observations are censored. Note the convexity
and concavity of the respective lower and upper bound functions in both ﬁgures.
In Figure 2(a), Û (v̂) = L̂(v̂) = 0.064, which is the sample mean of observed measurements. As p increases, Û (p) increases monotonically until p = 0.903, with Û (0.903) =
û3 = 0.068. From there, Û (p) decreases monotonically until Û (1) = L̂(1) = 0.065,
which is the sample mean of veriﬁed measurements Ê[Y |V = 1]. Similarly, L̂(p) decreases monotonically from either direction, reaching its inﬁmum at p = 0.871, with
L̂(0.871) = λ̂3 = 0.062. Thus, we have 0.062 ≤ Ê[Y1 ] ≤ 0.068.
Now, suppose we invoke A4. Then, as depicted in Figure 2(a), the upper bound is
reduced to û4 = Ê[Y |V = 1] = 0.065. This assumption has no effect on the lower bound.
Thus, the monotonicity assumption reduces the width of the estimated contamination bounds
by about two-ﬁfths. Figure 2(b) presents similar bounds for Lab 6, where the main qualitative
difference arises from the censoring that separates L̂(v̂) and Û (v̂). In this case, maintaining
A4 reduces the width of the contamination bounds by almost two-thirds.
The rectangles in Figure 3(a) depict point estimates of the contamination with monotonic veriﬁcation bounds on the mean concentration of 2-CNAP for each lab for both Love
Canal (LC) and the comparison region (CR). Figure 3(b) presents the corresponding bounds
for mean concentration of α-BHC. For example, the bounds [λ̂4 , û4 ] = [0.062, 0.065] in
Figure 2(a) are depicted as the third rectangle from the left (Lab 2, LC) in Figure 3(a). The
bounds [λ̂4 , û4 ] = [0.044, 0.049] from Figure 2(b) are reported in the column denoted (Lab
6, LC).

Note that the upper bound is concave and the lower bound is convex. The upper and lower bounds based on Lab 6

on mean concentration under contamination with monotonic veriﬁcation, whereas the vertical lines indicate the
corresponding bounds under corruption with monotonic veriﬁcation. In some cases, the point estimates of the
lower bounds for Love Canal (LC) greatly exceed the upper bounds for the comparison region (CR).

The vertical lines in Figure 3(a) depict point estimates of the bounds on mean 2CNAP concentration under corruption with monotonic veriﬁcation. The identifying power
of assumption A3 appears quite striking, as the lines tend to extend relatively far below the
rectangle. Of course, the comparison would be even more striking were we to not maintain
A4, in which case the upper bounds on the mean under corruption would approach one
billion ppb.
The picture is quite different with respect to mean concentration of α-BHC concentration, described in Figure 3(b). Here, the distance between the estimated corruption and
contamination lower bounds is almost imperceptible. This occurs because a sizeable fraction of veriﬁed observations at each lab are an order of magnitude greater than the median
veriﬁed observation. In fact, as reported in the bottom panel of Table 2 and depicted in the far
right of Figure 3(b) (All, LC), the estimated bounds on mean concentration in Love Canal
under corruption with monotonic veriﬁcation are [2.695, 3.549], whereas the corresponding bounds on the median are just [0.1820, 0.2824], based on all laboratory measurements.
The bounds under contamination (reported in Table 2 and depicted in Figure 3(b)) are very
similar.
The estimated bounds on the mean α-BHC concentration may yield different inferences
about pollution in Love Canal than do the bounds on the median. For instance, suppose one
focuses on comparisons across regions of the mean concentration under contamination, as
did Lambert and Tierney. The point estimates of the bounds on the mean in Love Canal are
[2.727, 3.549], which greatly exceed the bounds for the comparison region of [0.544, 1.044].
The estimated 90%-conﬁdence intervals nearly overlap, but not quite–[1.555, 4.721] versus
[0.035, 1.551]. Further, A4 has no identifying power in this case, as the estimated bounds
under contamination are identical with and without the monotonic veriﬁcation assumption.
Under corruption with monotonic veriﬁcation, the point estimate of the bounds in Love
Canal also greatly exceed the estimate in the comparison region, but the conﬁdence intervals
overlap slightly.
Now consider a comparison of bounds on the median under contamination. We have
a point estimate of [0.198, 0.297] in Love Canal, versus [0.077, 0.211] in the comparison
region. The estimated bounds tighten somewhat when A4 is invoked, but they still overlap
across regions. Therefore, the bounds under corruption with monotonic veriﬁcation overlap
as well.
As shown for each lab in Figure 3(a) and reported overall in Table 2, the estimated
bounds on the mean concentration of 2-CNAP in Love Canal under corruption with monotonic veriﬁcation overlap the comparison region bounds in each laboratory except 1 and
7. Under contamination with monotonic veriﬁcation, the estimated bounds on the mean in
Love Canal exceed the comparison region bounds based on data from Labs 1,6, and 8, and
actually fall below the comparison region bounds in Labs 2 and 7. Thus, the contamination
and corruption models yield very different ﬁndings if one focuses on the point estimates of
the bounds.

6. SUMMARY
This article undertakes a nonparametric analysis of models of corruption with veriﬁcation and contamination with veriﬁcation. It extends and improves upon some of the work
begun by Lambert and Tierney (1997) on veriﬁcation problems.
Recall that F denotes the unknown distribution of interest. Lambert and Tierney (1997)
derived sharp bounds on functionals of F for a contamination with veriﬁcation model, and
developed nonparametric maximum likelihood-type estimators of these bounds. They did
not consider the corruption with veriﬁcation model. Their estimation procedure does not
easily handle censored responses or incorporate plausible monotonicity restrictions. Nor can
their procedure be easily extended to handle the case where the response variable depends
on continuous regressors.
This article develops sharp bounds on functionals of F for both corruption with veriﬁcation and contamination with veriﬁcation models. Sharp bounds under plausible monotonicity conditions are also derived. Nonparametric estimators of the bounds are developed
that easily incorporate censoring and plausible monotonicity restrictions. All estimators are
√
n-consistent, and the estimators for the corruption with veriﬁcation model are asymptotically normal. The estimation procedure can be easily extended to handle continuous
regressors.
We apply the estimation procedures to organic pollutant data from the Love Canal.
These data are partially censored and can be reasonably assumed to satisfy certain monotonicity restrictions. If these restrictions hold, then the contamination with veriﬁcation
model is invalid. Thus, we argue that a corruption with veriﬁcation model that incorporates
censoring and all plausible monotonicity restrictions may be a more appropriate model for
this data.

APPENDIX
Lemma 1. Suppose M is an increasing function on the support of Y1 . If A1, A2, B4,
and B4 hold, then A4 holds.
Proof: Assumptions A1 and A2 imply that
IP {V = 1 | Y1 = y} = IP {V = 1 | Z = 1, Y1 = y}IP {Z = 1 | Y1 = y} .
Assumptions B4 and B4 imply that IP {V = 1 | Y1 = y} is increasing in y. We will show
that this last monotonicity condition implies that for each t in the support of Y1 ,
IP {Y1 ≤ t | V = 1} ≤ IP {Y1 ≤ t} ≤ IP {Y1 ≤ t | V = 0} .

(A.1)

The result will follow from this stochastic dominance condition and the fact that M is
increasing.
By Bayes’ rule,
IP {Y1 ≤ t | V = 1} = IP {V = 1 | Y1 ≤ t}IP {Y1 ≤ t}/IP {V = 1} .

337

Thus, IP {Y1 ≤ t | V = 1} ≤ IP {Y1 ≤ t} if and only if IP {V = 1 | Y1 ≤ t} ≤ IP {V = 1}.
But
IP {V = 1} = IP {V = 1 | Y1 ≤ t}IP {Y1 ≤ t} + IP {V = 1 | Y1 > t}IP {Y1 > t} .
By the monotonicity condition, IP {V = 1 | Y1 ≤ t} ≤ IP {V = 1 | Y1 > t}, implying that
IP {V = 1 | Y1 ≤ t} ≤ IP {V = 1}. The proof that IP {Y1 ≤ t} ≤ IP {Y1 ≤ t | V = 0} is
similar. This proves (A.1).
2
Proof of Theorem 1. We establish sharpness of the upper bound. The proof for the
lower bound is similar. By A1 and A2, IE[M (Y1 ) | V = 1] = IE[M (Y ) | V = 1]. It
follows that
IEM (Y1 ) = IE[M (Y ) | V = 1]v + IE[M (Y1 ) | V = 0](1 − v) .
Suppose that all censored Y values equal c, so that Y = Y . In addition, suppose that given
V = 0, the distribution of M (Y1 ) puts unit mass at b. These suppositions are consistent
with A1, A2, and the assumptions about the support of M (Y1 ). Under these suppositions,
IEM (Y1 ) = u1 . This proves the result.
2
Proof of Theorem 2. Apply A4 to get
IEM (Y1 )

= IE[M (Y1 ) | V = 1]v + IE[M (Y1 ) | V = 0](1 − v)
≤

IE[M (Y1 ) | V = 1] .

By A1 and A2, IE[M (Y1 ) | V = 1] = IE[M (Y ) | V = 1]. This yields the upper
bound. As in the proof of Theorem 1, suppose that all censored Y values equal c, so that
Y = Y . In addition, suppose that given V = 0, the distribution of M (Y1 ) puts unit mass at
IE[M (Y ) | V = 1]. Then IEM (Y1 ) = u2 , proving sharpness.
2
Proof of Theorem 3. Recall the deﬁnition of L(p) and U (p) given prior to the statement
of Theorem 3. From (3.1) and (3.2) we obtain the infeasible bounds
L(p∗ ) ≤ IEM (Y1 ) ≤ U (p∗ ) .
It follows from this and the deﬁnition of λ3 and u3 that
λ3 ≤ L(p∗ ) ≤ IEM (Y1 ) ≤ U (p∗ ) ≤ u3 .
That is, λ3 and u3 are bounds for IEM (Y1 ) under A1, A2, and A3. We want to prove that
they are sharp bounds under these assumptions.
Assume, in addition to A1, A2, and A3, that p∗ is known. Then L(p∗ ) and U (p∗ ) are
sharp bounds for IEM (Y1 ) because they are based on the sharp bounds of Horowitz and
Manski (1995) for IE[M (Y )|Z = 1, V = 0].
Now drop the assumption that p∗ is known. Arguments in Dominitz and Sherman (2004)
can be adapted to show that (an extended version of) L̂(p) is convex and (an extended version

of) Û (p) is concave on [0, 1]. Arguments in Sherman (2003) show that L̂(p) converges
pointwise to L(p) and Û (p) converges pointwise to U (p) on [0, 1]. It then follows from
the convexity lemma in Pollard (1991) that L(p) is convex and U (p) is concave on [0, 1].
Deduce that both L(p) and U (p) are continuous on [v, 1]. Because any p ∈ [v, 1] is a feasible
value for p∗ under assumptions A1, A2, and A3, so are the p values that minimize L(p) and
maximize U (p) over [v, 1]. This proves that λ3 and u3 are sharp bounds on IEM (Y1 ). 2
