Summary. Comparing self-assessed indicators of subjective outcomes (such as health, or job

satisfaction) across countries or socio-economic groups is often hampered by the fact that differ
ent groups use different response scales. Anchoring vignettes are used as a tool to identify and
correct for such differences. The paper develops a model in which objective measurements are

used to validate such vignette-based corrections. The model is illustrated with an application
to objective and subjective self-assessments of drinking behaviour by students in the Republic
of Ireland. Model comparisons using the Akaike information criterion favour a specification with
response consistency and vignette-corrected response scales. Put differently, vignette-based
corrections appear quite effective in bringing objective and subjective measures closer together.

1. Introduction

In many important substantive areas, the most widely used data that are availa
individuals' behaviours and attitudes are inherently qualitative and subjective.
people are typically asked to rate themselves on a subjective scale. One commo
people's ratings of their health on the traditional five-point scale from excellent to
subjective scales are pervasive in the health field and would include, in addition to g

status, measures of the ability to function in daily activities (i.e. 'Do you have any dif

x?'), work disability ('Do you have a health problem that limits the kind or amo

you can do?') and psychosocial measures ('Do you feel that things in your life are be
control?'). The widespread use of subjective scales is not limited to health. The place
erty thresholds, attitudes toward inequality and the effectiveness of political and g

institutions would be just some other salient examples (King et al, 2004).

These subjective scales all involve individuals' evaluation of some domain of their own objec
tive reality (such as their true health) compared with their own subjective view of what it means
to be above or below a given threshold (such as excellent and very good). How someone situates
oneself within these scales clearly depends both on the objective reality of one's situation and
on one's unique set of subjective thresholds. Since both the objective reality and the subjective
thresholds can vary across individuals, it is not possible, using answers to the subjective scale
questions alone, to know how much of the eventual rating of individuals on these scales reflects
true objective differences between people and how much reflects variation across people in their

subjective thresholds (Sen, 2002; Lindeboom and Van Doorslaer, 2004).
One important new research tool that has been advanced to deal with this problem involves
the use of anchoring vignettes. Respondents are first asked to evaluate their position in a given

domain on a subjective scale. Vignettes are essentially short descriptions of the positions of
hypothetical people in the same domain. Respondents are then asked to evaluate one or more
vignette persons on the same scale that they used to rate their own position. Because the objec
tive situation of the person who is described in the vignette(s) is the same for all respondents,
anchoring vignettes have the potential to identify individual variation in subjective thresholds.

A critical assumption on which identification rests is called 'response consistency' (RC)—i.e.
respondents use the same subjective thresholds in rating the vignette persons as they use when
rating themselves.
Research using anchoring vignettes has grown rapidly in recent years. Vignette questions have
been applied in work on international comparisons of health (King et al., 2004; Salomon et al.,

2004; Bago d'Uva et al., 2008a, b; Lardjane and Dourgnon, 2007), political efficacy (King et al.,
2004), work disability (Kapteyn et al., 2007), job satisfaction (Kristensen and Johansson, 2008)
and life satisfaction (Kapteyn et al., 2010). In all these applications, subjective scales were used,
and significant differences emerged across respondents in different socio-economic groups or
countries in the subjective outcomes that were measured. Anchoring vignettes were employed
to assess whether these groups also differed in their subjective thresholds.
Despite the rapidly growing use of anchoring vignettes, there has been little attempt to test the
basic identifying assumption of RC. Anchoring vignettes will often change the adjusted distri
bution of responses on the subjective scale, and sometimes they change them by a large amount.
But how do we know whether the vignette-adjusted scales are any better than the unadjusted
scales or not? Having objective data to which the unadjusted and vignette-adjusted distributions

of qualitative responses can be compared makes it possible to address this issue. For example,
King et al. (2004) compared the visual acuity between Chinese and Slovakian respondents
reported by them, who were asked self-reports of vision and shown a number of vignettes, but,
in addition, a randomly chosen half of the respondents were administered the Snellen eye chart
test. Whereas self-reports of visual acuity show no appreciable difference between Slovakian
and Chinese respondents, the eye chart test suggests that the vision of the Chinese respondents
is considerably worse. Once the self-reports are corrected by using vignettes they concur with
the eye chart tests in that now the Chinese respondents are shown to have considerably worse
eyesight. In recent references, Datta Gupta et al. (2010) and Hullegie and Vonkova (2010) used
the framework that is developed in the current paper in health domains, whereas Jiirges and
Winter (2009) presented an indirect test for RC, testing whether vignette evaluations depend on
the age and sex that is suggested by the names of the people who are described in the vignettes.
In this paper, we provide a more formal analysis by developing a statistical model for combin
ing objective and subjective measures, and testing RC, under the maintained assumption that
the objective and subjective measures are driven by the same factor. Our method is illustrated
by using vignettes in a survey of drinking behaviour that we designed and conducted among

Use of Anchoring Vignettes for Correction of Response Scale Differences 577
students at a major university in the Republic of Ireland. Problem drinking of adolescents, and

in particular college and university students, is a significant public health problem in many
countries (see, for example, Ham and Hope (2003) for the USA and Gill (2002) for the UK) and

Ireland is among the countries where alcohol abuse by adolescents is most prevalent (Mayor,
2001; Ramstedt and Hope, 2005). It is well documented in the literature that excessive drinking
is associated with other negative behaviour (Ham and Hope, 2003; Gibson et al., 2004; Wechsler

and Wuethrich, 1999) and with major causes of adolescent mortality (Schmid et al, 2003).
The specific example that is examined in this paper involves a subjective assessment of
self-rated drinking problems. An advantage of this application is that the actual construct that
the question is trying to elicit is readily accessible by a simple objective behavioural measure,
1.e. by asking the respondent how much he or she drinks, with answers on a numerical scale.
Although this might be open to the criticism that asking such a question in some way potentially

leads to a biased response (as respondents chose to mask their actual behaviours), we provide
evidence on the validity of this approach and also base our survey on a set of well-validated
question designs (Babor et al, 2001). The students were also given a set of drinking vignettes
and asked to evaluate the drinking behaviour of students in the vignettes. Drinking is a useful
case-study given the potential for social desirability and self-serving biases when rating one's
own behaviour and thus provides a challenging test of the vignette methodology.
The remainder of this paper is organized into four sections. Section 2 first outlines the intui
tion behind the use of vignettes and then presents the formal statistical model that we shall use
to determine whether the RC is supported by the data or not. Section 3 briefly describes the
data that are used in the application, including the vignettes. The fourth section summarizes the
empirical estimates of this model and the final section highlights our main conclusions.

2. Anchoring vignettes: intuition and statistical model

In this section, we first provide an intuitive description of the use of vignettes for
response scale differences and then sketch our formal statistical approach. Suppose th

of self-reports in the two groups would suggest that people in group A have mo

Fig. 1. Comparing self-reported drinking problems in two groups in the case of DIF: (a) group A; (b) group B

vignette person is the same, the difference in the evaluations by the two groups must be due to
DIF. Vignette evaluations thus help to identify differences between the response scales. Using
the scales in one of the two groups as the benchmark, the distribution of evaluations in the other
group can be adjusted by evaluating them on the benchmark scale. The corrected distribution
of the evaluations can then be compared since they are now on the same scale. The underlying
assumption that is necessary to make this adjustment is RC; a given respondent uses the same
scale for the self-reports and the vignette evaluations.

measure help to identify the parameters in the equation for the subjective evaluations and pro
vide the additional identifying information to test for RC, as we shall explain in detail below.
Three assumptions play a role. The first two are those identifying the HOPIT model: vignette
equivalence and RC. Vignette equivalence means that, other than through the thresholds, the way
in which respondents interpret and evaluate the vignettes must be independent of respondent
characteristics. This could be violated in situations where the respondents refer to their own sit
uation to impute missing information in the vignette descriptions. We maintain vignette equiv

alence throughout the paper. Given the straightforward nature of our application, we think
that this is justified at least for our application. The assumption of RC means that respondents
use the same thresholds when they evaluate themselves as when they evaluate vignettes. This
is the hypothesis of our main interest. The third assumption that we consider is the one-factor
(OF) assumption: it means that a common factor drives the objective measure and the subjective
measure, once the latter has been purged of DIF. In other words, this is the assumption that objec
tive and subjective measure are driven by the same underlying latent index. In the most general
model, we impose neither RC nor the OF assumption. We shall see in the statistical model that
is presented in detail below that, maintaining one of these assumptions, the other can be tested.

2.2. Subjective self-assessments
The subjective self-assessment (YS(- for respondent i) has a subjective response scale; in our
empirical example this is a five-point scale related to alcohol consumption: mild, moderate,
some cause for concern, excessive and extreme. In the empirical work we shall combine the
categories excessive and extreme because the latter does not have many observations and we
therefore work with four ordered outcomes.

As in the HOPIT model, the reported self-assessments FSi- are assumed to be driven by an
underlying and unobserved continuously varying latent index Y* reflecting actual drinking

behaviour. Y* is modelled as

Y*=Xips

Here, m, is N(0, cr^) and is distributed independently of X, and of the other error terms in the
model. The fact that different respondents use different response scales represents DIF. The
term «,• introduces an unobserved heterogeneity term (which is modelled as a random individual
effect) in the response scale.

Using subjective self-reports on own drinking behaviour only, parameters /3 and 7J are not
separately identified; only their difference is identified (although the 7/ for j > 1 will still be

identified). For example, nationals of different countries may engage in different drinking behav
iours. If the scales on which they report their drinking behaviour can vary across countries,
qualitative self-reports on drinking are not enough to identify the difference in the distribution
of drinking problems across nationalities, as was illustrated in Fig. 1.

2.3. Vignette evaluations
Vignette questions use the same qualitative five-point responses scale as the self-reports (mild,

moderate, some cause for concern, excessive and extreme) and, as before, the latter two cate
gories are merged. The evaluations Yu of vignettes l=l,...,L (L— 4) in our application) are
modelled by using similar ordered response equations, but with thresholds instead of r^
(7 = 0,..., 4):

Y*i — Z//7T + £/(, 1

Yu = j if'<}-*<;4, 7=1,...,4, \ (4)

The only explanatory variables in the vignette evaluation equation are variables Zu that cha
acterize the exact nature of vignette / that is presented to respondent i (in our application

dummy variables for the amounts that the vignette persons typically drink, for the gender of th
vignette persons and a dummy for whether the respondent has been shown a screen explaining
what is a meant by a drink). Respondent characteristics X[ are not included in equation (4)—this
is the maintained assumption of vignette equivalence that was discussed above: if respondents
receive the same vignette description and assuming that there is no ambiguity in interpreting th
information, there is no reason why different respondents should give systematically differen
evaluations except because of differences in response scales.

The thresholds are modelled in a similar way to those in the self-report equation, but i

assumed to be the same in the thresholds for vignettes and subjective self-reports. This is needed
for identification and without loss of generality—in the subjective self-reports, we cannot dis

2.4. Objective measure

then be caused by

(a) an imperfect correspondence between the subjective and objective measure,
(b) finite sample estimation errors and, for the simulated values,

(c) idiosyncratic errors in both F* and Y*.
However, predicted or simulated values of Y* and Y* based on a model not allowing for DIF
should be less similar to each other, since in that case the predictions of K* will be affected by
DIF whereas those of Y* will not. We shall therefore look at the correlation between predicted
as well as simulated values of Y* and F*(- for each model.

3. Survey data and the drinking vignettes
The sample for this study was recruited from a Web-based survey of students attending a large
Irish university: University College Dublin (for details on this data set, see Delaney et al. (2008)).
In total, 4450 students started the Web-based survey, from March to May 2006, of which 3500
completed the survey. The mean age of respondents is 21.5 years, and 90% of members of the

sample were below age 25 years. The gender breakdown of the sample is 45% male and 55%
female. The sample of 4500 students represents approximately 20% of the total body of 20000
students and 50% of those who use the college e-mail system.

How representative this sample is of the total student body is not critical for this applica
tion. Instead, selection bias would arise with this Internet panel, if, conditionally on observables,
respondents provide different vignette evaluations. Kapteyn et al. (2007) could test this assump
tion in a Dutch Internet sample where all respondents without Internet access could still partic
ipate because they were provided with a free set-top box: a small keyboard, a device to use their
television screen as a monitor and a device to connect to the Internet. For this sample, it was
known whether or not respondents had Internet access before they joined the panel. Kapteyn
et al. (2007) re-estimated a model for vignette evaluations with dummy variables for whether a
respondent had prior access or not. These dummy variables were insignificant, suggesting that
at least for that application prior Internet access was not selective on these responses to vignette

questions.
Web-based surveys may heighten fears of privacy of data. Therefore, the confidence of
potential respondents must be gained by assuring them about confidentiality of the survey. As
well as adopting strict controls on data protection, we included an explicit assurance of confiden
tiality in our Web-based questionnaire. Furthermore, all respondents were given an anonymous
password that they could use to re-enter the survey at any time.

Respondents were asked several demographic, personal and family background questions.
These include age, nationality, accommodation during term, relationship status, year of study,

the number, age, drinking and smoking behaviour of siblings, parental variables including
maternal and paternal education, marital status, drinking and smoking, occupational status
and gross income, and individual financial information including average monthly income,
sources of income and average monthly expenditure.
To ensure that there is no confusion that 'drinking' refers specifically to drinking alcohol,
the module on drinking was prefaced with a statement The following questions are about your
alcohol consumption'. All respondents were then asked the following basic question in relation
to their drinking; 'When did you last have a drink (that is more than just a few sips)?' and given
the five response options 'I have never had a drink', 'Not in the past year', 'More than 30 days

ago but less than a year ago', 'More than a week ago but less than 30 days ago' and 'Within the

last week'. Of a total of 4058 people who answered this question, 6.7% were abstainers, 6.3%
claimed to have consumed alcohol more than 30 days but less than a year ago, 22.5% consumed
alcohol more than a week but less than 30 days ago and 64.5% consumed alcohol within the last
week. The 93% of the sample who consumed some alcohol during the last year were asked the
specific questions on their alcohol consumption, subjective assessments of their own drinking
problems and the vignette drinking questions.

Respondents were asked two types of question about their own drinking behaviour. The
first objective variant asked them to quantify the actual amount that they drank. Given that

they drank at all, they were asked two objective measures of the extent of their drinking—
frequency of consumption and volume of consumption per occasion. In terms of frequency,
12% of respondents drink 'less than once a month', 25% drink 'less than once a week', 30% of
respondents drink 'once a week', 33% of respondents drink 'more than once a week' and 0.66%
of respondents drink daily.

The second objective measure concerns the volume of drinking per occasion, which was
worded as

'(Ql) How many drinks containing alcohol do you have on a typical day when you are drinking?'.

The permissible answers for question (Ql) are less than 1, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-9 or 10 or more. I
terms of volume consumed 2% drank less than one drink, 10% drank between 1 and 2, 25%
drank between 3 or 4, 32% drank between 5 or 6, 22% drank between 7 and 9, and 9% dran
10 or more drinks.

Before this question was asked, a random half of the students were shown a screen informin
them that a drink is 10 g of alcohol and were also given examples of types of drink with a trans

lation into grams. For example, a half-pint of beer would be 9.8 g and a pint would be 19.5 g.
As we demonstrate below, there were no statistically significant differences between the sampl
of students who were given this information and those who were not given this information in
terms of their description of their subjective and objective drinking behaviour as well as their
description of the people in the drinking vignettes.
As the discussion above indicates, our analysis relies on self-reports of our objective measures
of drinking. There is a legitimate concern that such self-reports may be significantly biased. For
tunately, these concerns have been repeatedly tested in the alcoholism literature. For example,
in a comprehensive review Sobell and Sobell (2003) reported that, in the form in which we ask
the questions (clearly worded objective questions on frequency and amounts and assurances of
confidentiality), several comprehensive reviews conclude that 'self-reports are generally accurat
and can be used with confidence'. Similarly, in a study of young social drinkers Townshend and
Duka (2002) reported that there is a high correlation between self-reports of amounts of own
drinking and diary methods that record drinking over the past month. To avoid measurement
errors as much as possible, we have taken our questions from a widely used alcohol screening

questionnaire that has been validated several times in the literature (see, for example, Babo
etal. (2001)).
The respondents were also asked to rate their own drinking on an ordered qualitative scale,
by using the question

'(Q2) How would you describe your own drinking patterns over the course of the last year?: Mild
Moderate, Some Cause for Concern, Excessive, Extreme'.

In terms of the responses, 26.9% describe their drinking as mild, 43.9% as moderate, 18.5% as
some cause for concern, 9.6% as excessive and only 1.5% of the students in our sample describe
their drinking as extreme.

Finally, vignette questions were asked about the drinking behaviour of hypothetical peers.
The use of the Web surveying format allows for a complete experimental design to test the impor
tance of various dimensions. In particular, we presented to each respondent four vignettes with
different levels of severity of drinking in randomized order, and a randomly assigned male or
female name in the vignettes. The vignette drinking questions are of the form
'(Q3) [John/Mary] is out on a given night and has [2 or 3, 5 or 6, 7 to 9, 10 or more] drinks contain
ing alcohol. Is [John/Mary]'s drinking habit- -Mild, Moderate, Some Cause for Concern, Excessive,

Extreme?'.

Vignettes of the form of question (Q3) have the same possible answers as question (Q2) on
respondents' own drinking (although question (Q2) may also be interpreted as referring to the
number of drinking occasions and not only the number of drinks on each occasion; see the dis
cussion below. Table 1 lists the distribution of responses to drinking vignettes. The responses are
stratified by the number of drinks that was mentioned in the drinking vignettes. We have some
times combined groups to improve comparability with the categories of self-reported quantities
of drinks. Not surprisingly the percentage of students who thought the drinking behaviour that
was described in the vignette was either excessive or extreme rises rapidly with the number of
drinks. For example, only 0.1% of students thought that 2-3 drinks merited the description of

excessive or extreme whereas the percentages saying that it was excessive or extreme for the other

drinking amounts in the vignettes were 4.2% (5-6 drinks), 38.7% (7-9 drinks) and 70.3% (10 or
more).
In the right-hand panel of Table 1, responses to the vignette questions are presented sepa
rately by the students' objective report of their own drinking behaviour. In each case we show
the distribution of response categories for the person who is described in the vignette along
side the distribution of subjective responses for the students' own drinking. Since in each of
these situations the amount of drinking is approximately the same in the vignette and for the
students evaluating the vignette, RC would imply similar distributions of subjective responses
and vignette responses in each panel. The opposite extreme (no RC at all) would imply that
the evaluation of the drinking behaviour of the vignette persons would be independent of the
drinking behaviour of the student.
The data in Table 1 appear to support RC strongly. Consider, for example, students who had
7-9 drinks. 19.6% of these students describe their own drinking as either excessive or extreme
whereas 19.2% of them describe the drinking behaviour of the vignette person (who has 7-9
drinks) as excessive or extreme. For this case, the qualitative subjective evaluation of own drink
ing problems and that of the vignette person are basically identical. Moreover, both these distri
butions are very different from the distribution in the first column, representing the responses of
all students in the sample. Most students at this university drink less than 7-9 drinks and their
assessment of the drinking behaviour of these vignette persons is much harsher—38.7% of all
students describe having 7-9 drinks as excessive or extreme. The general finding that students
characterize vignette persons similarly to the way that they characterize their own drinking tends
to hold for all the drinking categories that are included in Table 1, with the possible exception
of respondents who say that they typically have 5-6 drinks. The high correspondence between
assessments of own drinking and that of vignettes is even more remarkable given the fact that
vignettes in our application have the limitation that they are incomplete in the sense that they
only describe one dimension of drinking (how many drinks on a typical drinking occasion) and
not the other dimension (the number of drinking occasions).

If RC holds, and people who drink more are less harsh in their evaluation of their own drink
ing than people who drink relatively little, this also implies that distributions of self-reported
problem drinking understate the tails of the true distribution of drinking problems. For exam
ple, if the response thresholds of the median drinking were used to evaluate drinking behaviour
of the full population, there would be more people who would be seen as having no problem at
all and more who would be designated as problem drinkers.

other (the number of typical drinking days), the OF assumption does not seem very plausible
in our case. Thus we cannot interpret this result as evidence against RC—it may well be due to

violation of the OF assumption.
This view is reinforced if we consider the AIC. According to the AIC, model 6 is the preferred

model. In other words, according to the AIC a model that assumes RC, but does not impose
the OF assumption, provides the best fit to the data.
Not only does the likelihood improve substantially by allowing for DIF; it also brings objec
tive and subjective indices much more in line with each other. The best way to see this is by

comparing models 3 and 6. The correlation between the systematic parts increases (half the
gap between this correlation and its theoretical maximum of 1 is bridged), and the correlation
between unsystematic parts (£0!- and £SJ) increases as well. Thus vignettes certainly help greatly

to reduce the problem of DIF. In our example, correcting for DIF by using vignettes bridges
a substantial part of the gap between objective and subjective measures of drinking behaviour.

It does not completely bridge the gap—and this may be because the objective and subjective
measure do not exactly measure the same thing, as also suggested by the AIC.

4.1. Parameter estimates of selected models

We present parameter estimates of two models imposing RC and not imposing the OF as
tion, the model allowing for DIF (model 6 in Table 2) and the model not allowing for DIF
3 in Table 2). We report the parameter estimates for the equations explaining self-assess

ing behaviour (equation (1)), the vignette thresholds (equations (3) and (5)) and the o
drinking measure (equation (7)).
Some covariates entering these models can be separated into three classes—perso

butes of the students, including age, gender, nationality and level of study (Bachelor or M

as well as family background including number of siblings, level of education, family in
family composition and drinking habits of both parents. Table 3 provides a detailed desc
of all covariates. Indicator variables for missing values for any variables that were men
above are included in the models but not listed in the tables.

Table 4 presents the parameter estimates for our ordered probit equation of selfdrinking behaviour based on answers to the subjective question (Q2) that was cited i
2 on the severity of one's drinking behaviour. The second and third columns present pa
estimates in the no DIF case (not adjusted for the scales that are obtained from the vign
whereas the last two columns list parameter estimates that have been adjusted for the v

differences in thresholds. Taking first the no DIF estimates (the standard model in the lit
that we would estimate without any vignette correction for different thresholds amon

dents), we find that drinking problems are reported to be less severe among female stu
(which is consistent with many other studies—for example, Rimal and Real (2005) found
it can be fully explained by gender differences in perceived benefits from alcohol cons

among married students, among singles who are dating and among those students
not Irish nationals. In contrast, drinking problems are more severe among those w
siblings over age 16 years, and those who are single and not dating (the reference c
with married and single 'going out'). Drinking by the students is also positively related

drinking of either of the parents. The education of neither parent affects drinking pro

these college students, but higher parental income is associated with more alcohol c

tion (which is consistent with other findings such as those of Weitzman and Chen (2005

found a positive association between alcohol consumption and parental education (a
controlling for neither parental income nor parental drinking behaviour).

national is much larger than self-reports of problem drinking would have us believe. The expla

nation for these differences in parameter estimates is clear from Table 5, which gives estimates
of threshold parameters for the model accounting for DIF. The critical differences show up in
the first threshold. To illustrate, non-Irish students have very different (and stricter) norms on
what is considered mild versus moderate drinking, and a similar shift applies to the other thresh
olds—in other words, what Irish students call mild drinking is often called moderate drinking by
foreign students. Similarly, female students have a lower threshold for what constitutes problem
drinking.
This makes sense since women are biologically more affected by a given quantity of alcohol

consumption than men (see, for example, Frezza et al. (1990)). First, men and women metabo
lize alcohol at different rates, holding size or weight constant. This seems to be due to the effect

of high levels of oestrogen slowing the metabolism of alcohol. Second, women are on average
significantly smaller than men (weight or height) and, since the negative effects of alcohol are
highly correlated with blood alcohol levels, women will on average experience greater negative

consequences of a given amount of alcohol intake.
Additional drinking by parents raises the threshold of what constitutes problem drinking.
Given the narrow age range in this sample, one should not make much of the estimated quad
ratic age terms. But, with that caveat, it appears that up to age 23.6 years students are becoming
looser on drinking standards and after that a little stricter.

Table 6 presents our estimates of the ordered probit equation for the objective measure of
drinking behaviour, i.e. the answer to the question 'How many drinks containing alcohol do you
have on a typical day when you are drinking?' with answers 1 'less than 12' 1 or 2', 3 '3 or 4', 4 '5
or 6', 5 '7-9' or 6' 10 or more'. With the objective measure, the two models with and without DIF
give very similar results. To illustrate, with the objective measure the effect of being a non-Irish
student is the same in the DIF and non-DIF models. This is as it should be, since DIF leads
to threshold variation for the subjective drinking measure but not for the objective measure
of drinking. The parameter estimates on the objective measure are more in line with the DIF
estimate in Table 4 than with the no-DIF estimate, as, for example, the parameter on non-Irish.

The first panel of Table 7 presents the estimates for the equation explaining the vignette
evaluations. The vignette dummy variables are in line with vignette descriptions—they are
ordered from least drinking (vignette 1) to most drinking (vignette 4). Explaining how a drink
is defined on an introductory screen makes the vignette evaluations move slightly to less exces
sive drinking, but the difference is small and marginally significant only for one of the four

vignettes. The sign suggests that, for most respondents, 'a drink' is less serious than what
they had thought. The sign of the coefficient of the dummy variable for whether a female
name is used in the vignette shows that the same drinking behaviour is considered signifi
cantly more excessive if the vignette person is female than if the person is male. Combining
observed and unobserved variation shows that the correlation between objective and subjective

reports is 0.636 in the model without DIF, and 0.734 in the model with DIF—a substantial
improvement.

subjective scales between different groups of students, particularly between students of Irish
and non-Irish nationality and males and females. We find that the vignettes do a very good job
in bringing self-reports on the severity of one's drinking in line with objective information about
the quantity of their alcohol consumption, even though the formal test rejects RC. This is clearly
illustrated by the raw data (Table 1), where students who consume a certain amount of alcohol
tend to exhibit very similar responses regarding their own drinking and the drinking of vignette

persons who approximately consume the same amount of alcohol. According to the AIC, the
model maintaining RC provides the best fit to the data. In addition we find that allowing for
differences in thresholds is extremely important for improving the fit of the model and in raising
the correlation between the subjective drinking scale and the objective drinking measure.
Our application is facilitated by the fact that there is a measure on an objective scale that is
easy to observe and has a clear relationship to the domain in which we are eliciting subjective

responses. Even this application, however, has some caveats. The measure on the objective
scale is still self-reported and might suffer from systematic measurement errors. If such errors
are correlated with, for example, nationality or gender of the respondents, in a similar way to
the reporting thresholds that are used in the subjective evaluations, this might invalidate our
approach. A second limitation of the application is that the vignettes are in a sense incomplete,

since they only describe the number of drinks in a given situation and not how often such
occasions occur. Strictly speaking, this means that individuals are reporting about their own
behaviour in two dimensions but the vignettes describe only one dimension. This in itself makes

Use of Anchoring Vignettes for Correction of Response Scale Differences 593
it all the more remarkable how good a job the vignettes are doing in correcting for differences
in response scales.
Our application as such has limited value for practice—even if RC is valid, there seems not
much reason to administer the vignettes if the same thing can be measured with a simple self
report on an objective scale. The method that we have introduced will work best in applications
where the objective measure unambiguously corresponds to the domain of the subjective mea
sure and is not prone to reporting biases. For example, one can think of truly objective physical
measurements for some domains of health, such as a lung capacity test for breathing, or a chair

stand test for mobility (see Hullegie and Vonkova (2010)). These objective measures may still
not perfectly correspond to what respondents perceive as problems with breathing or mobility,
which is problematic for the maintained hypothesis that is needed for the formal test of RC, but
they are perfectly suited for the model selection and the correlation analysis that we propose
to analyse whether vignettes help. Moreover, in cases like this, obtaining the objective measure

in a survey may be expensive or practically infeasible (in phone interviews, for example), so
self-assessments corrected with vignettes are a feasible alternative.
In our application, one dimension of the domain of interest is ignored in the vignettes (the
number of drinking occasions), but our results suggest that this is not a large problem. Extend
ing the approach to situations where multiple objective indicators need to be combined requires

extending the model: not only will multiple equations for the objective measures be needed,
but also an equation which says how the objective measures can be combined into a single
index that is comparable with the subjective measure. This seems feasible but is left for future
research. In cases with more ambiguity about the exact objective situation on which one is elic
iting subjective responses, the use of anchoring vignettes may be less successful. In essence this
would be caused by the fact that a vignette description must be brief and therefore will tend

to be incomplete. More research is needed to investigate the optimal amount of information
provided in the vignettes, making the trade-off between more noise due to longer vignettes that
respondents will not read carefully, versus incomplete information that will be supplemented

by the respondents' own imputation, possibly invalidating the assumption that all respondents
interpret the vignette situation in the same way (vignette equivalence).
More fundamentally, the approach to correct for response scale differences by using vignettes
requires that the domain of interest can be described by a single index for all respondents: if, for

example, drinking really has two dimensions, amount per occasion and number of occasions,
then the weights that different respondents attach to these two dimensions must be equal. Test
ing this assumption or extending the approach so that this assumption can be avoided seems to
be another interesting topic of future research.

Consider the self-assessment equation, which can be rewritten as

Y*=Xl&fntDl+{*
= I* +<Mi
Here I* is an index for genuine drinking behaviour and csi is reporting error. Under the OF assumption,
there is a monotonically increasing transformation g such that the latent variable underlying the objective
measure of drinking behaviour can be described by

n*=<?(/,*+coi).
Here <;oi is an idiosyncratic error of similar nature to csj, inducing noise in the objective (self-)reports. The

thresholds for the objective measure are well defined in the question—the categories are 1 'less than 1',
2 '1 or 2', 3 '3 or 4', 4 '5 or 6', 5 '7-9' or 6 '10 or more', so it seems plausible to define the thresholds as
(mo,mi,... ,m5,m6) = (—oo, 1,2.5,4.5,6.5,9.5, oo). Thus the model for the reported categorical objective
measure becomes

Yoi = j if mj-i<g(I* + ?oi) ^mj, j= 1 6.
This can be rewritten as

Yoi = j if g~\mhX)< I* +<;0i^g~\mj), j= 1,...,6.
Defining t£ =g~l(mj), this gives the expression for the reported objective measure in the text. Note that
the tI, j = 2,3,4, 5, are unknown parameters (ordered from low to high since g is monotonically increas
ing). In other words, we can conclude that making the rj, j = 2,3,4, 5, unknown parameters allows for
an unknown, possibly non-linear, transformation between indices driving the objective and subjective
measures, and thus helps to make the OF assumption no stronger than necessary.
