abstract
We introduce a nonparametric estimator for local quantile treatment effects in the regression
discontinuity (RD) design. The procedure uses local distribution regression to estimate the marginal
distributions of the potential outcomes. We illustrate the procedure through Monte Carlo simulations
and an application on the distributional effects of a universal pre-K program in Oklahoma. We find that
participation in a pre-K program significantly raises the lower end and the middle of the distribution of
test scores.

1. Introduction
The regression discontinuity design (RDD) was originally
developed by Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960) as a quasiexperimental design for evaluating the impact of an education
program in a setting where exposure to a treatment is determined
by exceeding some score threshold. The prediction, made by
Campbell and Stanley (1963), that the RDD is ‘‘very limited
in its range of applications (that are) mainly educational’’ has
been proven wrong by the recent literature. The RDD has
received tremendous and increasing attention in many fields,
including labor markets, political economy, health, criminology,
environment, and development.1
The recent popularity of the RD design appears to be justified
in many cases. Black et al. (2007) and Buddelmeyer and Skoufias

(2003) compare RD to randomized experiments and find that the
RD estimates replicate the experimental results well (see Cook
and Wong, 2008, for a summary of studies comparing RD to
experiments).
The studies mentioned above and others using the RD design
focus on estimating average treatment effects. In many contexts,
however, the effect of a treatment on the entire distribution of
outcomes is of interest. For example, economists often evaluate the
social welfare implications of a policy based on the differences in
the distribution of outcomes under various alternatives (Atkinson,
1970). In the field of education (e.g., Leuven et al., 2007; Frölich
and Melly, 2010), achievement disparities are of large public
concern. When analyzing the effects of unemployment insurance
on unemployment durations (e.g., Lalive, 2008), the risk of
becoming long-term unemployed may be the principal concern.
Finally, a zero average effect may mask significant offsetting effects
at different points in the distribution, as in the effect of closelycontested unionization elections on employees’ earnings (DiNardo
and Lee, 2004; Frandsen, 2010).2

2 Even if one is not primarily interested in the distributional impacts or the impact
on inequality, one may still use the method proposed to reduce susceptibility to
outliers. Compared to the widely used mean RD estimator, a median RD estimator
can provide more stable estimates when the outcome variable is noisy, e.g. wages or

B.R. Frandsen et al. / Journal of Econometrics 168 (2012) 382–395

In this paper, we introduce a procedure to nonparametrically
estimate the effects of a potentially endogenous treatment on
the distribution of an outcome variable in the RD design. We
focus on quantile treatment effects (QTE) as a convenient way
to summarize these effects when the outcome is continuous, but
more generally our results imply uniformly consistent estimators
for any continuous functional of the distribution functions, e.g., the
Gini coefficient, the Lorenz curve or distribution treatment effects
(see Chernozhukov et al., 2009).3 The results in this paper apply
both to the fuzzy RD design and to the sharp RD design, which
we treat as a special case of the fuzzy design. Our procedure is
based on local linear estimates of the distribution functions. For an
appropriate choice of bandwidth, our estimator is consistent at the
n−2/5 rate but our results also allow for a sequence of bandwidths
that eliminates the asymptotic bias.
Our results are related to the previous theoretical work on
the RD design and quantile treatment effects under endogeneity.
Hahn et al. (2001) describe this design using the treatment
effects framework and formalize the assumptions required to
identify average causal effects and provide local linear estimators.
Porter (2003) complements their work by considering alternative
estimators. Our approach is in the spirit of these papers in using
local linear techniques to estimate effects at the threshold. Another
approach to estimating distributional effects in the RD context that
makes use of local linear techniques is being developed by Baker
et al. (2005), and relies on a selection-on-observables identifying
assumption at the threshold. This rules out cases where selection
into treatment is endogenous even at the threshold of the running
variable. Our estimator allows for endogenous treatment selection
even in a neighborhood of the threshold, and thus it has an IV
interpretation. Frölich (2007) incorporates covariates in a fully
nonparametric way and shows that efficiency gains are obtained
for mean estimation and that the rate of convergence does not
depend on the number of covariates. Imbens and Lemieux (2008),
van der Klaauw (2008) and Lee and Lemieux (2009) have surveyed
both the applied and theoretical literature on the RDD.
As Angrist and Lavy (1999) and Hahn et al. (2001) suggested,
the fuzzy RD design leads naturally to instrumental variables (IV)
type estimators, where the instrument is an indicator for exceeding
a threshold in the running variable. The estimator Hahn et al.,
develop has an interpretation as a local Wald estimator of a local
average treatment effect (LATE). Their insight suggests applying
IV quantile treatment effects estimators in order to estimate
distributional effects in the RD design.
Two recently developed approaches to IV quantile treatment
effects are Chernozhukov and Hansen (2005) and Abadie et al.
(2002). These two approaches rely on distinct sets of identifying
assumptions, and the interpretations of the estimands differ. An RD
quantile treatment effects estimator in the spirit of Chernozhukov
and Hansen (2005) is developed by Guiteras (2008). In some
contexts, however, the requirement of rank invariance or rank
similarity across treatment states in that model may be less
desirable than the LATE assumptions of Abadie et al. (2002).
In addition, the LATE framework does not require the outcome
variable Y to be continuous, such that we can allow masspoints
(e.g. of earnings at zero or top coding) or discrete outcome

earnings. The quantiles are well-defined even if the outcome variable does not have
finite moments due to fat tails. This is akin to the discussion on mean versus median
regression in linear regression models, where the robustness of median regression
to outliers was emphasized. This may be particularly relevant for the RDD since
the number of observations close to the discontinuity threshold is often relatively
small. In many applications, estimated effects on higher-education or employment
are often significant whereas effects on earnings or wages are insignificant, because
of the large variance of the latter estimates.

variables. We therefore focus on the LATE framework, although the
necessity of controlling for the running (or forcing) variable in the
RD design prevents the trivial application of Abadie, Angrist and
Imbens’ (AAI) estimator.4
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
develops the statistical framework. Identification results are
established in Section 3, and Section 4 describes the estimation
procedure. Section 5 derives the asymptotic distribution for the
proposed estimator and discusses inference. We present Monte
Carlo simulation results in Section 6. Section 7 applies the
procedure to estimate the effect of an Oklahoma universal pre-K
program on the distribution of test scores, and Section 8 concludes.
2. Econometric framework
We define causal effects using the potential outcome notation
in the framework known as the Neyman–Fisher–Rubin causal
model.5 We are interested in the effect of a binary treatment D
on an outcome variable Y . We observe n units, indexed by i =
1, . . . , n, which are drawn randomly and independently from a
large population. Let Yi1 and Yi0 be the potential outcomes of
individual i under treatment and no treatment, so the observed
outcome is Yi = Yi0 (1 − Di ) + Yi1 Di . We do permit arbitrary
treatment effect heterogeneity, i.e. there are no restrictions placed
on the treatment effects δi = Yi1 − Yi0 , and selection into treatment
may be endogenous.
The essence of the RD design is the presence of a running
variable R which influences the probability of treatment in a
discontinuous way when it exceeds some threshold r0 . We define
an indicator for exceeding the threshold to be Zi = 1 (Ri ≥ r0 ).
In the empirical example in Section 7 Ri will be individual i’s
birthdate and Zi will be an indicator for meeting an age cutoff for
pre-K eligibility. Let unit i’s potential treatment status as a function
of the running variable be Di (r ), so that observed treatment
status is Di = Di (Ri ). Let the limit (if it exists) of Di (r ) as r
approaches r0 from below be denoted D0i ≡ limr →r − Di (r ) and
0

let the limit (if it exists) from above be D1i ≡ limr →r + Di (r ).
0
Based on the local potential treatment states D0i and D1i , we
can conceptually classify individuals into one of several mutually
exclusive groups, extending the standard concept introduced
in Imbens and Angrist (1994). ‘‘Local always-takers’’ (AT) are
exposed to treatment whenever the running variable is near the
threshold, while ‘‘local never-takers’’ (NT) are never exposed to
treatment when the running variable is near the threshold. ‘‘Local
compliers’’ (C) are exposed to treatment when the running variable
approaches the threshold from above, but not when it approaches
from below, and vice versa for ‘‘local defiers’’ (DE). Finally, for
‘‘local indefinites,’’ (I) the treatment status as the running variable
approaches the threshold from either side does not have a welldefined limit. Formally, these classifications can be expressed as
events in a common probability space (Ω , F , P ):

In the following, we suppress explicit conditioning on R = r0
to simplify the notation, i.e. we will write QY |C and FY |C . Note
that this object reflects the effect of treatment on the distribution,
rather than the effect of treatment on any particular individual.
Without an additional rank invariance assumption, there is no
sense in which (1) represents the treatment effect for a particular
individual, since one individual could be at different ranks in the Y 0
and Y 1 distribution. See Koenker (2005) for a discussion of quantile
treatment effects and rank invariance with additional references.
3. Identification of treatment effects
Besides those embodied in the notation given in Section 2, we
make the following identification assumption.

Assumption I1 is the defining feature of the regression discontinuity design: the probability of treatment changes discontinuously
at the threshold value of the running variable. In the so-called sharp
RD design, the difference in the probability of treatment across the
threshold is one: treatment status is completely determined by location relative to the threshold. In the sharp design all units are
compliers, so the estimand (1) corresponds to the quantile treatment effect for all units at the threshold. In the fuzzy RD design
the difference in treatment probability is less than one – but still
strictly positive – so other factors influence selection into treatment besides the running variable. We focus on the more general
fuzzy design, treating the sharp design as a special case.6
Assumption I2 is a smoothness condition which, intuitively
speaking, ensures that after controlling smoothly for the running
variable, differences in the distribution of outcomes on either side
of the threshold are due to the change in probability of treatment
assumed in Assumption I1.
Assumption I3 is the crucial monotonicity assumption that
the response of treatment selection to exceeding the threshold

case of the fuzzy design.

is monotone.7 An immediate consequence of this assumption is
that the monotonicity condition rules out the existence of defiers
and indefinites in a neighborhood around the threshold. Finally,
Assumption I4 requires that observations close to r0 exist.
These assumptions are analogous to Hahn et al.’s (2001)
conditions for identifying the local average treatment effect in an
RD setting. Assumption I1 here is precisely their RD condition, and
Assumption I3 is equivalent to the monotonicity condition in their
assumption A3. The smoothness of FY d |R (y|r ) and E [Dz |R = r] in
Assumption I2 are analogous to their assumption A1 and the joint
independence condition in their A3. One difference is that Hahn
et al. assume only the smoothness of conditional expectations
while we require smoothness of the conditional distribution
functions because we are identifying quantile treatment effects.
Given our assumptions, at the threshold we can adapt Imbens and Rubin’s (1997) and Abadie’s (2002) method of identifying counterfactual distributions for compliers. The local
quantile treatment effect is then simply the difference between the
inferred marginal distributions of the potential outcomes for compliers at a particular quantile. The following lemma shows that the
local quantile treatment effect can be written as the horizontal difference between ‘‘local Wald ratios’’, emphasizing the connection
with instrumental variables estimation of treatment effects. (The
lemma is a special case of Frölich (2007). We provide a simplified
proof in Appendix B for notational consistency.)
Lemma 1 (Identification). Under Assumption I the distribution
functions of the potential outcomes for the compliers at the threshold
FY d |C (y) are identified for any y in R from the joint distribution of
(Y , D, R). The expressions for both distribution functions are given
in Eqs. (2) and (3) in Box I. The local quantile treatment effect is
identified as

4. Estimation
The local quantile treatment effect (1) may be consistently
estimated in a number of ways. We briefly mention one approach
that may appear to be the most obvious, and thereafter spend
greater time developing our preferred approach. At first blush,
one could think of adapting Abadie et al.’s (2002) IV quantile
treatment effects estimator to estimate local quantile treatment
effects, treating Zi = 1 (Ri ≥ r0 ) as a binary instrument for Di .
This approach requires ignoring any direct effects of Ri other than
through Zi , introducing a sort of omitted variables bias in finite
samples and leading to a slower rate of convergence, as discussed
in Appendix A. The Monte Carlo results below show that the

7 There are several settings in which monotonicity holds automatically, including
when non-compliance is one-sided, with either no treatment below the threshold,
or 100% treatment above the threshold. Other settings which imply monotonicity
are latent index models of selection.

combined bias from ignoring the running variable and boundary
effects can be large.
We overcome these bias problems by using local linear
techniques to estimate the distribution of the potential outcomes
for compliers at the discontinuity threshold. This estimator is
not subject to bias from ignoring the running variable and
automatically corrects for boundary effects (Fan, 1992). The key
task is nonparametric quantile estimation at a boundary, an
estimation problem considered by Yu and Jones (1998) in a setting
without an endogenous treatment. Their preferred technique,
which we adapt here, estimates conditional quantiles by inverting
local linear estimates of the conditional distribution function.
Given differentiability of the conditional distributions in a
neighborhood of the threshold, a consistent estimator for the
local quantile treatment effect, then, is the (horizontal) difference
between local linear estimates of the conditional distribution
functions (2) and (3) at a particular quantile:

4.1. Finite-sample refinements

δ̂LQTE (τ ) = Q̂Y 1 |C (τ ) − Q̂Y 0 |C (τ ) ,

where Ω (·) is a differentiable distribution function, e.g. the
normal cdf. By construction, the estimated distribution function is
continuous in finite samples. We follow Yu and Jones (1998) and
choose hY ≪ h so that the asymptotic distribution of the estimator
does not depend on the exact value of the bandwidth hY used to
smooth in the y-direction. As discussed in Appendix C, we also use
their operational rules of thumb for choosing the bandwidths.

and Lemieux (2008) for mean estimation. Define

algebraically identical to the nonparametric estimator F̂Y 1 |C (y)
given by (5). The estimator F̂Y 0 |C (y) can be similarly obtained by
weighted 2SLS, replacing Di by (1 − Di ) on both sides of (8). We
describe a data-driven choice of bandwidths in Appendix C.

In finite samples the conditional cdfs estimated by (5) and (6)
are non-monotonic step functions. This poses problems for the
inversion of the cdfs to obtain the quantile functions. We follow
here the suggestion of Chernozhukov et al. (2010) and monotonize
the estimated distribution functions by re-arrangements. This does
not affect the asymptotic properties of the estimator but allows it
to be inverted. This procedure consists of a sequence of closed-form
steps and is fast.8
For some applications where the discontinuities are especially
large it helps to smooth the problematic indicator function on the
left hand side of (8). Yu and Jones (1998) suggest smoothing ‘‘in the
y-direction’’, which in our setting amounts to estimating F̂Y 1 |C (y)
by weighted 2SLS on the following regression equation

4.2. Special case: sharp and semi-fuzzy designs
The identification results and estimation procedure described
above assume a fuzzy RD design, but they apply equally well to
the special cases of sharp and semi-fuzzy designs, where treatment
status may be constant on one or both sides of the threshold.
Identification is more straightforward, since the monotonicity
condition, Assumption I3, is automatically satisfied in the sharp
and semi-fuzzy designs. In the sharp design case, the procedure
still consists of inverting estimated distribution functions on each
side of the threshold, but since now Di = Zi , the distribution
functions can be obtained by simple weighted least squares
estimation of (8).
4.3. Including additional covariates
Perhaps the main advantage of the canonical RD design as
described above is that identification does not require controlling
for additional covariates, a point made by Hahn et al. (2001).
However, empirical analysis often includes additional covariates
for any of several reasons: to establish identification, to explore
how the parameter of interest varies in subgroups, to test the
sensitivity of results to incorporating different sets of covariates,
to separate direct from indirect effects or to increase precision.
If Assumption I holds conditionally on covariates X , then the
identification results stated above now apply immediately to
the treatment effect conditionally on X . In the case of discrete
covariates, comparing estimation results for different values of the
covariates may be of interest, for example, comparing achievement
gains for students of different socio-economic backgrounds.
Specific values of a continuous covariate may also be conditioned

et al. (1999). This could improve the small sample behavior of the estimator but is
neither sufficient nor necessary to guarantee the monotonicity of the distribution
functions F̂Y 1 |C (y) and F̂Y 0 |C (y).

upon, but this would require another smoothing parameter,
and a curse of dimensionality would apply, slowing the rate of
convergence and reducing power.
In many situations we are however more interested in the
unconditional effect, that is, the effect for all compliers irrespective
of their value of X . In this case, covariates – discrete or continuous
– could be incorporated for sensitivity analysis and precision gains,
as Frölich (2007) shows for the case of mean estimation. Because
all covariates but the running variable are integrated out, the curse
of dimensionality is avoided and the rate of convergence is not
affected. Frölich’s (2007) results can be extended to the quantile
treatment effects but this is outside of the scope of this paper.

5. Asymptotic distribution theory and inference
In this section, we derive the limiting distribution for the local
quantile treatment effects estimator, (4), obtained via inverting
estimated distribution functions. The regularity assumptions we
employ are analogous to those used by Hahn et al. (1999). Define

1p = lim E [D|R = r] − lim E [D|R = r] ,
+
r →r0

−
r →r0

which represents the change in the probability of treatment at the
threshold and corresponds to the limiting fraction of compliers.
The following assumption comprises the regularity conditions
under which the limiting distribution of our estimator is derived.
Assumption E. E1 The left and right limits of the functions
E [1 (Y ≤ y) (1 − D) |R = r ], E [1 (Y ≤ y) D|R = r], and E [D|R
= r ] are twice left- and right-continuously differentiable with
respect to r at r0 with second derivative Hölder continuous
in a left and right ε -neighborhood of r0 , respectively, and are
uniformly bounded in y ∈ Y, where Y is a compact subset of R,
for some ε > 0.
E2 1p is strictly positive.
E3 The density fR (r ) is bounded away from zero and infinity in a
neighborhood of r0 .
E4 K (·) is Borel measurable, bounded, continuous, symmetric,
nonnegative-valued with compact support, and integrates to
one.
√
E5 Bandwidth conditions: nh → ∞ and nhh2 → γ < ∞.
Assumption E1 ensures that the underlying conditional distributions of potential outcomes are sufficiently smooth at the discontinuity. E2 requires that the probability of treatment changes
discretely at the threshold. It corresponds to some kind of strong
instrument assumption in an instrumental variables framework.
E3 ensures that the distribution of the running variable is well behaved near the threshold. E4 imposes standard conditions on the
kernel function. Assuming that the kernel is symmetric, bounded,
non-negative and integrates to one is not strictly necessary and
only imposed in order to provide simpler expressions for the bias
and variance. (If a kernel is used that does not satisfy these properties, the expressions for the bias and variance need to be recalculated.) E5 characterizes the sequence of bandwidths, and thus
determines the rate of convergence of the estimator. For γ > 0,
squared bias and variance are of the same order, and the estimator minimizes the asymptotic mean squared error, converging at
2

the n− 5 rate. If we choose a bandwidth such that γ = 0, the bias
vanishes asymptotically, but the convergence rate is slower.
Asymptotic normality of the quantile treatment effect estimator
(4) follows from the weak convergence as a process of the complier
cdf estimators, (5) and (6), and the functional delta method (van
der Vaart, 1998). All proofs are given in Appendix B. We summarize
the asymptotic results first for the distribution functions of the
potential outcomes and thereafter for the quantile functions.

This result is of interest in its own right, as it is the basis
of deriving the limiting distribution of any parameter that is a
function of the counterfactual distributions, including distribution
treatment effects, counterfactual densities, and comparisons of
stochastic dominance. It also provides the basis for deriving the
limiting distribution of the quantile treatment effects process
below.
For deriving the above limit processes of the distribution
function estimators and any functional thereof, e.g. the Gini
coefficient or other inequality measures (see Frölich and Melly,
2010), we can permit Y to be discrete or continuous or mixed
discrete–continuous, e.g. continuous with some mass points. If Y
is not continuous, however, the inverse of the cdf is not uniquely
defined everywhere. This does not pose a problem for identifying
quantile treatment effects, with quantiles defined as QY (τ ) =
inf {u : FY (u) ≥ τ }, but the asymptotic properties of the estimated
QTE are different when Y is not continuous. In the following, we
derive the asymptotic properties for the quantile treatment effects
estimator for the case where Y is continuous, making an additional
assumption on the uniqueness of the quantiles of the potential
outcomes.
Assumption Q. FY 0 |C (y) and FY 1 |C (y) are both continuously differentiable with continuous density functions fY 0 |C (y) and fY 1 |C (y)
that are bounded away from zero and infinity on Y.
With this additional assumption, we establish the limiting
process for the QTE estimator.

A corollary of this result is that the quantile treatment effects
estimator for any finite set of indices {τk } has a jointly normal limiting distribution. Inference may be based on consistent estimates
of the asymptotic variance and the asymptotic normality.
Consistent estimation of the asymptotic variance requires
consistent estimates of the quantities in the variance formulas in
Theorem 3 and Corollary 4. The conditional expectations in the
variance formulas can be estimated via local linear regression. The
conditional density fY 1 |C can be estimated via weighted 2SLS on the
following equation:

where φ (·) is a density function, e.g. the normal density. The
density fY 0 |C can be estimated analogously. Finally, fR (r0 ) can
be estimated using, for example, Fan et al.’s (1996) local linear
density estimator. After constructing consistent estimates of the
asymptotic variance from these intermediate consistent estimates,
hypothesis tests or confidence intervals based on the normal
distribution will be consistent.
6. Monte Carlo results
To illustrate the practical performance of our estimation
procedure, in this section we present the results of Monte Carlo
simulations. The primitive of the
the simulations
 model underlying

is the joint distribution of Y 0 , Y 1 , D, R , which we specify as
follows: R ∼ N 0, σR2 and Y 0 = R + ε0 , Y 1 = Y 0 − ε1 and





D = 1 Y 1 − Y 0 + α · 1 (R ≥ 0) ≥ εD , and the disturbance terms
(ε0 , ε1 , εD ) are jointly normal and independent with mean zero
and variances σ02 , σ12 , and σD2 , respectively. This model could be
interpreted as a simple Roy model of selection on gains where
exceeding the threshold r0 = 0 reduces the gross cost of treatment
εD by α . It exhibits the key features of the RD design with
heterogeneous treatment effects. Note that the average treatment
effect (ATE) is zero. In this model, the complier group is C =
{0 < εD + ε1 ≤ α}, and for positive α , the local average treatment
effect (LATE) is negative.
Two key parameters affecting the performance of the estimators are the sample size, N, and the change in the probability of
treatment at the threshold, 1p. The greater the magnitude of 1p,

We illustrate the performance of the estimators for several
scenarios which are broadly representative of actual empirical
examples. For each scenario, we perform 500 repetitions with
parameter values σR = σ0 = σ1 = σD = 1, with α = 0.5
(‘‘small 1p’’) or α = 3 (‘‘large 1p’’) and a sample size of either N =
10, 000 (‘‘small N’’) or N = 100, 000 (‘‘large N’’). To call a sample
size of 10,000 ‘‘small’’ of course reflects the demands on the data
nonparametric estimators require in general. We use a uniform
kernel with bandwidths chosen as described in Appendix C.
We compare our local linear approach to estimating quantiles
of the compliers’ potential outcomes to a ‘‘local constant’’ approach
described in Appendix A that applies instrumental variables
quantile treatment effects estimation using kernel weights to
narrow in on the threshold, ignoring the running variable (Abadie
LQTE).10
The first simulation scenario, ‘‘large N, large 1p ’’, represents
the most favorable conditions for the estimation procedures. We
set α = 3, which implies a jump in the probability of treatment
at the threshold of about 48%, and we use a sample size of
100,000. This change in the probability and the sample size are on
the order of those found in several recent RD studies, including
Matsudaira (2008) and Jacob and Lefgren (2004). In this and all
scenarios, bandwidths for the preferred approach were chosen in
each repetition according to the procedure outlined in Appendix C.
Typical values for the bandwidth were in the range 0.15–0.3.
The bandwidths for the local constant approach were chosen to
minimize the simulated mean squared error. While this choice
is infeasible in practice, it gives an upper bound on how well
a local constant approach might perform relative to local linear
approaches.
Fig. 1 shows the results of the simulation under this scenario
for RD LQTE. The figure shows the average point estimate for each
quantile index, as well as the pointwise (in the quantile index)
90% confidence interval spanned by the fifth and 95th percentile
estimate. The figure shows that the bias is very small, despite the
fact that the estimator consists of nonlinear functions of estimated
quantities. The estimates also appear to be quite precise, although
the simulations are not calibrated to any particular economic
context to give the scale meaning. By way of comparison, Fig. 2
illustrates the performance of applying the locally constant Abadie
LQTE approach to the RD setting. The confidence intervals are
somewhat wider, and the estimates are substantially biased. Thus
in terms of bias and variance, the local linear RD LQTE approach
appears to do strictly better, although for samples this large and
discontinuities of this size the difference is not extremely large.
The second simulation scenario, ‘‘small N, large 1p ’’ illustrates
the implications for the performance of the estimators when the
sample is smaller. The change in the probability of treatment
remains at 48%, but we use a sample size of 10,000. This
corresponds roughly to the empirical application in Section 7 based
on Gormley et al. (2005). Fig. 3 shows that the confidence intervals
for RD LQTE are substantially wider than for the large N case, but
the bias remains negligible. Fig. 4 shows that Abadie LQTE, on the

treatment effects estimator to the RD setting using the shorthand ‘‘Abadie LQTE’’,
we emphasize those authors did not propose applying their estimator to the RD
design.

large sample size in this scenario, the smaller 1p results in the
widest confidence intervals for any of the simulation scenarios we
consider. The bias, however, remains negligible, even for a much
smaller 1p. As Fig. 6 shows, the confidence intervals for applying
Abadie LQTE to RD are also widest for this scenario, and the bias
is the greatest as well. Thus even for relatively large sample sizes,

which is in line with 10
as predicted by the asymptotic theory.
Furthermore, according to asymptotic theory the length of the
confidence interval should also be inversely proportional to 1p,
which is also what we found in the simulations when comparing
the ‘‘large N, large 1p’’ design (1p = 48%) to the length of the
confidence intervals in the ‘‘large N, small 1p’’ design (1p = 14%).

estimated bandwidths were on the order of 30–40 days.

a small jump at the threshold in the probability of treatment can
result in significant bias in the local constant approach.
Not surprisingly, the precision of the estimator was best when
the sample size and/or the discontinuity was large. In all cases,
however, the bias was minimal. The simulations also highlight that
the local linear approach perform unambiguously better than an
approach ignoring the effects of R within a window around the
discontinuity.
The simulations also confirmed that the approximation given
by the asymptotic theory seems to perform well. When we
increased the sample size from 10,000 to 100,000, the length of
the confidence intervals reduced to 40% of the previous length,

In this section, we apply the RD quantile treatment effects
procedure to an example from the literature which will both
illustrate how the procedure might be applied to real-life
questions, as well as point out some challenges faced by
nonparametric estimation of distributional effects.
Interventions designed to improve educational performance
are one setting in which distributional effects may be very
important to policy makers. One such policy that specifically
targets the lower end of the distribution is the introduction of
universal pre-K programs. Gormley et al. (2005) use a regression
discontinuity design to analyze an Oklahoma universal pre-K
program, and find significant positive effects on average test scores
measuring cognitive development along a variety of dimensions.
By conditioning on various socio-economic status indicators, they
find indirect suggestive evidence that the program also has
positive effects on the lower end of the distribution. The quantile
treatment effects estimator developed in this paper allows direct
investigation of the effect of the policy on the lower end of the
distribution.
Oklahoma introduced a universal pre-K program for four-yearolds in 1998, and by 2002–2003 (the period we analyze) 91% of the
state’s school districts were participating, including Tulsa Public
Schools (TPS), the largest district in the state, and the district from
which our sample is drawn.
A child’s participation in the pre-K program is voluntary (on the
part of the parents), but is subject to a birthday cutoff eligibility
rule. Children who had turned four years old by September 1, 2002
were eligible for the program, while younger children were not.
Fig. 7 shows the discontinuity in probability of treatment that the
eligibility rule induced. Because the participation among children
who missed the cutoff is essentially nil, local treatment effects in
this setting correspond to the effect of treatment on the treated.
At the start of the 2003–2004 school year, all incoming
kindergartners and TPS pre-K participants were given the Woodcock–Johnson Achievement Test, a nationally normed test that
has been widely used in studies of early education. Treated students are those who participated in a TPS pre-K program the
previous year.
We use a sample of 4710 incoming TPS kindergartners and preK participants. The dataset includes exact birthdate, an indicator
for participation in TPS pre-K the previous year (the treatment
variable), and scores on the three Woodcock–Johnson subtests:
Letter-word, Spelling, and Applied Problems.
Using a uniform kernel and bandwidths chosen by the plug-in
method described in Appendix C, we estimated the local treatment
effects of attending the Pre-K program on the three subtests of
the Woodcock-Johnson test. The estimated bandwidths were on
the order of 30–40 days. The estimated local quantile treatment
effects of TPS pre-K programs on scores on the three subtests of the
Woodcock-Johnson tests are plotted in Fig. 8. The figure shows the
point estimates for each quantile index, as well as pointwise (in the
quantile index) 90% confidence intervals based on the asymptotic
distribution.
Panel A shows a relatively precisely estimated two to four point
(around 80% of a standard deviation) effect on the lower end of the
distribution of the Letter-Word Identification score. The estimated
effect on the middle of the distribution is a somewhat larger five

390

B.R. Frandsen et al. / Journal of Econometrics 168 (2012) 382–395

to eight points, but less precisely estimated, and the effect on the
upper end of the distribution is estimated to be close to four points.
Effects on the distribution of the Spelling score are plotted in panel
B. Similar to the Letter-Word test, the effect on the lower end of the
distribution is a relatively precisely estimated two to four points.
The effect above the 75th percentile is smaller and not significantly
different from zero. Panel C shows the effects of pre-K participation
on the Applied Problems score. The point estimates are largest and
most precisely estimated for the bottom end of the distribution,
and the point estimates of the effects for the top of the distribution
are smaller and not significantly different from zero. For reference,
the local average treatment effects (LATE) are estimated to be
3.66 for Letter-Word Identification, 1.93 for Spelling, and 3.44 for
applied problems.11 An application of the local constant, Abadieweighted approach (not reported) yields a similar pattern across
quantiles, but with point estimates higher by about two tenths of a
point, which is consistent with the bias observed in the simulations
in Section 6.
The estimation results imply that universal pre-K in Oklahoma
succeeded in significantly raising the lower end of the distribution
of test scores, especially for the Applied Problems subtest. These
results are consistent with Gormley et al.’s (2005) findings that
point estimates of average effects were larger for children from
potentially disadvantaged socio-economic groups. These results
are subject to the caveat that they measure the net effect of
participating in a TPS pre-K program versus alternatives parents
might have chosen in the absence of the program. The alternatives
might have been different for children at different points in the
distribution, and thus we cannot draw conclusions about the
gross impact of universal pre-K programs on the distribution
of outcomes. An additional caveat is that these results reflect
the short-term effect. It is possible that children who did not
participate may catch up over time, although evidence from the
Perry Preschool Study (Schweinhart et al., 1993; Anderson, 2008)
suggests that there may be significant long-term impacts of pre-K
programs.
8. Conclusion
In this paper, we describe how the regression discontinuity
design can be used to evaluate the impact of endogenous
treatments on the entire distribution of outcome variables. We
show that both potential outcome distributions are identified
for the population affected by the discontinuity. We introduce
estimators for these two distribution functions and show their
joint convergence to continuous Gaussian processes. We also
consider in detail the quantile treatment effect process when
the dependent variable is continuous. By appropriate bandwidth
choice, our estimators are consistent at the n−2/5 rate. Monte Carlo
simulations confirm that the bias of the approach we suggest is
small.
An application of the procedure to estimating the effects of an
Oklahoma universal pre-K program across the distribution of test
scores shows that the lower end of the distribution is significantly
raised, while estimates at the top of the distribution are smaller and
less precise. Other possibilities for applying the methodology are
numerous, and include the study of remedial education programs
by Jacob and Lefgren (2004) and Matsudaira (2008), the study of
the UI Worker Profiling and Reemployment Services program by
Black et al. (2003), and the effect of unions on wages by DiNardo
and Lee (2004).

Appendix A. Relationship to Abadie et al. (2002)
In this appendix, we discuss the relationship of our estimator
to an approach based on adapting Abadie et al. (2002) to an RD
setting. (However, note that they never proposed to use their
method for an RD setting.) Our Assumption I is analogous to
those required for Abadie et al.’s (2002) local quantile treatment
effects estimator. Instead of independence between an instrument
and potential outcomes and potential treatment status, we make
continuity assumptions on the distribution of potential outcomes
and potential treatment status. The LATE first stage assumption
is replaced by the analogous RD assumption that the probability
of treatment jumps discretely as the running variable hits the
threshold value. Assumption I3, local monotonicity, is directly
analogous to the monotonicity assumption in the LATE framework.
The most striking difference between our assumptions and
Abadie et al.’s (2002) assumptions is the absence here of the
‘‘Non-trivial assignment’’ condition which they require. Indeed,
the principal challenge of applying Abadie et al.’s (2002) quantile
treatment effects estimator in an RD setting is that the non-trivial
assignment condition fails here, since conditional on the running
variable, the ‘‘instrument’’, Z = 1 (R ≥ r0 ), is deterministically
either zero or one.
An adaptation of Abadie et al.’s (2002) IV quantile treatment
effects estimator to estimating the local quantile treatment effect
would give the following. This estimator treats Z = 1 (R ≥ r0 )
as a binary instrument for D and combines kernel weights which
narrow in on the threshold with ‘‘complier finding’’ weights:

κv = 1 −

D (1 − E [Z |Y , D])
1 − E [Z ]

−

(1 − D) E [Z |Y , D]
E [Z ]

.

These weights can be estimated via kernel regression centered on
R = r0 to form κ̂v i , and the estimator would take the form:



(10)

where K (·) is a kernel function, ρτ (u) = (τ − 1 (u < 0)) u and
hn is a smoothing parameter. Strictly speaking, all expectations in
the definition of κv should be taken conditional on the running
variable, R. In that case a zero would appear in one of the
denominators, since Z is a deterministic function of R, violating
the so-called non-trivial assignment condition which requires
that there be variation in the instrument conditional on included
variables. However, as the sample size grows, in the limit we
are conditioning on R = r0 , and so there is no longer any
need to include R as a regressor, and thus the technique can be
applied. However, in finite samples, there will be variation in R
over the window defined by the kernel weights. This leads to a

B.R. Frandsen et al. / Journal of Econometrics 168 (2012) 382–395

sort of omitted variables bias, since the instrument Z may not be
independent of the potential outcomes when we do not condition
on R. This finite sample bias is analogous to the inflated bias of
locally constant kernel regression estimators, noted by Fan (1992).
For the case of quantile regression, Yu and Jones (1997) show
that the bias in this approach is proportional to the slope of the
conditional quantile function estimated. Another source of bias in
this approach stems from implicitly estimating quantile functions
1
at a boundary,12 leading to a convergence rate of n− 5 instead of
2

the rate n− 5 . The Monte Carlo results of Section 6 showed that the
combined bias from ignoring the running variable and boundary
effects can be quite large.

case of Frölich (2007). We provide here a simplified proof to

B.2. Proofs for asymptotic distribution
The following lemma will be helpful in deriving the asymptotic
properties of the complier cdf and quantile function estimators.
Asymptotic normality of the quantile treatment effect estimator
(4) follows from the weak convergence as a process of conditional
expectation estimators of the form (7) and the functional delta
method (van der Vaart, 1998). The following lemma establishes
the weak convergence as a process of the local linear conditional
expectation estimator m̂+
1(Y ≤y)D (r0 ). An analogous result holds for
the corresponding left limit, as well as for replacing D by (1 − D).
Having established that the local linear conditional expectation
estimators converge as processes, we can afterwards apply a
functional delta method to derive the limiting distribution of the
complier distribution function estimators (5) and (6). (A comment
on notation: in the proofs we occasionally denote the bandwidth h
as hn to emphasize the dependence on the sample.)

For ease of notation, in this proof we consider a sample drawn from
the joint distribution of (Y , D, R) conditional on R ≥ r0 , with a
sample size of n, and we therefore omit explicit conditioning on
R ≥ r0 in sums (i.e. n refers here to the number of observations with
Ri ≥ r0 ). We write the bandwidth as hn to emphasize dependence
on the sample size. To show the weak convergence of m+
1(Y ≤y)D (r0 )
we establish that each of the terms An,0 , An,1 , An,2 , Bn,0 (y) , Bn,1 (y)
converge weakly as processes, and apply a functional delta method.

the

R × ℓ∞ (R)2 → (0, 1) ⊂ R, and define ℓ∞ (R) as the set of all
uniformly bounded real functions on the real line, and C (R) as the
space of continuous functions on the real line. As a map from R5
to (0, 1) ⊂ R (for a fixed value of y) the usual differentiability of

holds trivially for l = 0 for bounded K (·). For l = 1, 1b is essentially
the Lindeberg–Feller condition, and holds if, for example, R is
bounded. Condition 2 is implied by our assumption that K (·) is
measurable.
The quantity in condition 3 can be written as
P fn,s − fn,t

for every δn ↓ 0. This holds under uniform continuity of
FY |R=r ≥r0 ,D=1 , which follows from E1.
Finally, by example 2.11.24 on page 221 of van der Vaart and

where

The procedure we propose for estimating quantile treatment
effects involves choosing a set of bandwidths for each quantile
index τ being estimated. In principle, the asymptotically optimal
bandwidths for each τ can be derived using the limiting
distributions shown in Corollary 4. While straightforward, we
suggest an alternative approach that avoids estimating secondorder derivatives for each τ . We pursue an approach similar
to Yu and Jones (1998), making simplifying assumptions that
justify operational rules of thumb for choosing these bandwidths
based on a single reference set of bandwidths in the context of
local linear quantile regression. To simplify notation in the main
text, we assumed a single bandwidth, h. In practice, however, it
may be desirable to allow bandwidths to differ for estimation
of QY 0 |C (τ ) and QY 1 |C (τ ) and on either side of the threshold.
We therefore propose choosing two bandwidths h1τ + , h1τ − for

estimating QY 1 |C (τ ) and bandwidths h0τ + , hτ
for QY 0 |C (τ ).

We describe in the following how to choose h1mean

0

Lemieux (2008) suggest for the RD context, we choose h1mean
to
minimize the approximate mean squared error of a local linear
estimator of this quantity. However, instead of the cross-validation
method they propose, we suggest the plug-in method. This has
been shown to have better convergence properties theoretically
(see Ruppert et al., 1995, for discussion), and in practice we have
found plug-in to be more reliable than cross-validation. Fan (1992)
shows that the conditional mean squared error of a local linear
regression estimator with a bandwidth h at the boundary can be
written as
