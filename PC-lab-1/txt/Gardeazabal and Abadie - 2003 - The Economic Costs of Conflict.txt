The Economic Costs of Conflict:
A Case Study of the Basque Country
By ALBERTO ABADIE AND JAVIER GARDEAZABAL*

This article investigates the economic effects of conflict, using the terroristconflict
in the Basque Countryas a case study. Wefind that, after the outbreakof terrorism
in the late 1960's, per capita GDP in the Basque Country declined about 10
percentage points relative to a synthetic control region without terrorism. In
addition, we use the 1998-1999 truce as a natural experiment.Wefind that stocks
of firms with a significantpart of their business in the Basque Countryshowed a
positive relative performancewhen truce became credible, and a negative relative
performance at the end of the cease-fire. (JEL D74, G14, P16)

Political instabilityis believed to have strong
adverse effects on economic prosperity. However, to date, the evidence on this matter is
scarce, probablybecause it is difficult to know
how economies would have evolved in absence
of political conflicts.
This article investigates the economic impact
of conflict, using the terrorist conflict in the
Basque Country as a case study. The Basque
conflict is especially interesting from an economic perspective. At the outset of terrorist
activity in the early 1970's, the Basque Country
was one of the richest regions in Spain, occupying the third position in per capita GDP (out
of 17 regions). In the late 1990's, after 30 years

of terrorist and political conflict, the Basque
Countryhad droppedto the sixth position in per
capita GDP.1During that period, terroristactivity by the Basque terrorist organization ETA
resultedin almost 800 deaths. Basque entrepreneurs and corporationshad been specific targets
of violence and extortion (including assassinations, robberies, and kidnappings-for-ransom).
Not surprisingly,the economic downturn suffered by the Basque economy during those
years has been attributed,at least partially, to
the effect of terrorism.However, little research
has been carried out to assess the economic
effects of the conflict.2
This type of study is difficult. On the one
hand, a pure time-series analysis of the severity
of terrorism and the evolution of the Basque
economy will be contaminatedby the economic
downturnwhich Spain suffered duringthe second half of the 1970's and the first half of the
1980's, at the peak of terroristactivity. On the
other hand, at the outset of terrorism, the
Basque Country differed from other Spanish
regions in characteristicsthat are thought to be
relatedto potentialfor economic growth.Therefore, a simple comparison of the evolution of
the Basque economy and the economy of the
rest of Spain would not only reflect the effect of
terrorism but also the effect of pre-terrorism
differences in economic growth determinants.

THEAMERICANECONOMICREVIEW

Ouranalysis rests on two differentstrategies.
First, we use a combination of other Spanish
regions to constructa "synthetic"controlregion
which resembles relevant economic characteristics of the Basque Countrybefore the outset of
Basque political terrorism in the late 1960's.
The subsequent economic evolution of this
"counterfactual"Basque Country without terrorism is comparedto the actual experience of
the Basque Country. We find that, after the
outbreak of terrorism,per capita GDP in the
Basque Country declined about 10 percentage
points relative to the synthetic control region.
Moreover,this gap seemed to widen in response
to spikes in terroristactivity. The second partof
this study uses the unilateraltruce declared by
ETA in September1998 as a naturalexperiment
to estimate the effects of the conflict. If the
terroristconflict was perceived to have a negative impact on the Basque economy, stocks of
firms with a significantpart of their business in
the Basque Countryshould have shown a positive relative performanceas the truce became
credible, and a negative relative performanceat
the end of the cease-fire. We find evidence that
is consistent with this conjecture using event
study methods.
Most of the empiricalliteratureon the effects
of political conflict on economic variableshave
used cross sections of country-leveldata. Using
a cross section of countries,Yiannis P. Venieris
and Dipak K. Gupta(1986) and AlbertoAlesina
and Roberto Perotti (1996) concluded that political instabilityhas a negative effect on investment and savings. Also using a cross section of
countries,RobertJ. Barro (1991), Paolo Mauro
(1995), and Alesina et al. (1996) have argued
that political instabilityhas a negative effect on
economic growth.3 A potential caveat of this
literatureis thatpartof the observedassociation
between political conflict and economic variables across countries is thought to be created
by reverse causation, since political instability
is not only a cause but also an effect of fluctuations in economic variables.4 Instrumental

variables techniques can be used to correct for
reverse causation. However, the validity of instrumentsin cross-countryregressionshas often
been questioned(see, e.g., N. GregoryMankiw,
1995). Anotherpotentialshortcomingof studies
based on country-leveldatais thatpolitical conflicts in different countries may be radically
differentin nature.Such heterogeneitymay create problems when comparing the experiences
of differentcountriesand interpretingthe results
(JonathanTemple, 1999, discusses heterogeneity issues in cross-countryregressions).
Case studies, like the one presented in this
article, look like the naturalavenue to validate
or refutethe resultsgiven by cross-countrystudies. Heterogeneityissues are circumventedhere
by focusing on a particularconflict:the terrorist
conflict in the Basque Country.In addition, as
explained below, the Basque conflict has no
direct economic motivation and, in contrast to
most other violent conflicts, it does not take
place in a region under particularlyharsh economic conditions. Consequently,temporalvariation in economic prosperity in the Basque
Country during the period considered in this
study is unlikely to have had a substantialeffect
on the intensity of terroristactivity, mitigating
endogeneity issues.
I. A Brief Historyof ETA's TerroristActivity
ETA was founded in 1959 to promote the
establishmentof an independentBasque state.5
However, it was not until 1968 that ETA
claimed its first victim. In fact, ETA did not
implementlarge-scale terroristactivity until the
however,thatrapideconomicgrowthproducessocial dislocation and may cause politicalunrest.While cross-countrystudies have shown a positive associationbetween poverty and
political conflict (see, e.g., Paul Collier and Anke Hoeffler,
2002), Alan B. Kruegerand JitkaMaleckova(2002) provide
evidence that, within country,disparitiesin individualsocioeconomiccharacteristicsseem to be unrelatedto participation
in politicallymotivatedviolence.

Basques are spread over the Basque Autonomous Region and Navarrain Spain, and part of the FrenchAtlantic
Pyrenees Department.The Basque Autonomous Region in
Spain has been, however, the main scenario of the conflict;
for the rest of the article, we use the term "the Basque
Country"to refer to this region. The Basque Autonomous
region is a small region with an area of 7,234 square
kilometers (around 1.5 percent of the total area of Spain)
and 2.1 million inhabitantsin 2000 (around5.2 percent of
the total populationof Spain).

iest three years of ETA, 1978-1980, witnessed
a total of 235 victims. In subsequentyears, the
numberof killings decreased gradually.On average, during the 1980's, ETA's activity resulted in 39 deaths per year; this figure was
reduced to 16 per year during the 1990's. The
number of kidnappings during the sample period was smallerthanthe numberof killings but
evolved similarly.In September1998, ETA declareda total and indefinitecease-fire.The ceasefirelastedapproximately14 months;in November
1999,ETA announcedthe end of cease-fire.In the
year 2000, ETA killed 23 people.
In order to finance its operations, ETA has
used kidnappings-for-ransom,extortion, and
(less frequently)robberies.The main targets of
such money-raisingactivities have been Basque
entrepreneurs,who have since begun to abandon the Basque Country in large numbers in
order to escape extortion or abduction by the
terroristgroup. In addition,the terroristconflict
has been frequently cited as a deterrence for
domestic and foreign direct investment in the
Basque Country(see, e.g., The Economist, November 25, 2000).
Finally, although terrorist attacks have occurred in almost all Spanish regions, most of
ETA's violent activity has been concentratedin
the Basque Country.Table 2 reportsdeaths and
deaths per million inhabitantsper year caused
by ETA for the period 1968-1997. Almost 70
percent of the deaths caused by ETA in Spain
during 1968-1997 occurred in the Basque

sembles the actual one before terrorism.Let X1
be a (K X 1) vector of pre-terrorismvalues of
K economic growth predictorsfor the Basque
Country [i.e., those values in Table 3, column
(1)]. Let Xo be a (K X J) matrixwhich contains
the values of the same variables for the J possible controlregions. Let V be a diagonalmatrix
with nonnegative components. The values of
the diagonal elements of V reflect the relative
importance of the different growth predictors.
The vector of weights W* is chosen to minimize (X1 - XoW)'V(X1 - XoW) subject to
wj ' 0 (j = 1, 2,..., J) and w, + - + wj = 1.
The vector W* defines the combinationof nonterrorismcontrol regions which best resembled
the BasqueCountryin economic growthdeterminantsat the outset of terrorism.9
Since W* dependson V thereis somethingto
be said about the choice of V. Arguably, the
choice of V could be subjective, reflecting our
previous knowledge about the relative importance of each particulargrowth predictor.Here,
we adopt a more eclectic method, choosing V
such that the real per capita GDP path for the
Basque Countryduringthe 1960's is best reproduced by the resulting synthetic Basque Country (see Appendix B for details).
The optimal weights, W*, are positive for
two regions, Cataloniaand Madrid,with values
0.8508 and 0.1492 respectively, and take value
zero for the other potential controls. The selection of Cataloniaand Madridby our procedure
as controls for the Basque Countryis not unexpected, since a visual inspection of the data
reveals thatthe values of the pre-terrorismcharacteristicsfor these two regions are comparable
to the values of the pre-terrorismcharacteristics
for the Basque Country.10Column (3) of Table
9 This
approachis closely related to statisticalmatching
methods for observationalstudies (see, e.g., Paul R. Rosenbaum, 1995). The reason to restrictthe weights in W to be
nonnegativeandsum to one is to preventextrapolationoutside
the supportof the growth predictorsfor the controlregions.
Withoutthis restriction(and if all the diagonalelementsof V
are positive),X1 would be perfectlyfittedas long as the rank
of Xo is equalto K, irrespectivelyof how distantis Xl fromthe
elements of Xo. When the weights in W are restrictedto be
nonnegativeand sum to one, X1 cannotbe perfectlyfittedin
generaleven if the rankof Xo is equalto K. In this case, Xl will
be perfectlyfittedonly if it lies in the "support"(convex hull)
of the growthpredictorsfor the controlregions.
10 Like the Basque Country,relative to the rest of
Spain
during the 1960's, Cataloniaand Madridhad higher levels
of per capitaincome, populationdensity, and humancapital.

Basque Countrybefore terrorism:X1 = XoW*.
These figures give an indication of how well
the weighted combination of control regions
reproducesthe values of growth predictorsfor
Basque Countrybefore terrorism.As expected,
the synthetic Basque Countrylooks comparable
to the actual one, although some growth determinantscannotbe perfectly fitted.In particular,
duringthe 1960's, the Basque Countrywas the
Spanishregion with the highest industrialshare
as a percentageof total production.Therefore,a
convex combination of other Spanish regions
cannot perfectly reproducethe Basque sectoral
shares before terrorism.
Let Y1 be a (T X 1) vector whose elements
are the values of real per capita GDP for the
Basque Countryduring T time periods. Let Yo
be a (T X J) matrix which contains the values
of the same variables for the control regions.
Our goal is to approximatethe per capita GDP
path that the Basque Countrywould have experienced in the absence of terrorism.This counterfactualper capita GDP path is calculated as
the per capita GDP of the synthetic Basque
Country,YV= YoW*.
Figure 1 plots Y1 and Y* for the period
1955-1997. The Basque Country and the synthetic controlbehave similarlyuntil 1975. From
1975, when ETA's terroristactivity becomes a
large-scale phenomenon, Y1 and YV diverge;
the Basque Countryper capita GDP takes values up to around 12 percent below those of the
synthetic control. The gap in per capita GDP
seems to decrease at the end of the period,
taking values around 8 or 9 percent in 19951997. Overall, Figure 1 suggests a 10-percent
loss in per capita GDP due to terrorismfor the
1980's and 1990's.
Statisticalinferenceon the effect of terrorism
on the economy can now be carried out by
looking at the relationshipbetween the per capita GDP gap (syntheticvs. actualBasque Country) and the intensity of terrorismin the Basque
Country during the sample period. Since production factors are fixed in the short run, we

effect of terrorismor is merely an artifactof the
inability of our analysis to reproducethe growth
path for the Basque Countryin the absence of
terrorism. To address this question we performed a "placebostudy,"applying the method
that we used to compute the gap for the Basque
Country to a "nonterrorismregion" (a region
other than the Basque Country).The idea is to
comparethe economicevolutionof a region similarto the BasqueCountry,butwithouthigh levels
of terroristactivity,to the economic evolutionof
its syntheticversion, also withouthigh levels of
terrorism.The purposeis to assess whetherthe
gap observedfor the Basque Countrymay have
been createdby factorsotherthanterrorism.
To conduct this "placebo" study we chose
Cataloniawhich was the region with the largest
weight in the synthetic control for the Basque
Country. In addition to being the region most
similar to the Basque Countrybefore terrorism
in economic growth determinants(as measured
using our methods), Catalonia resembles the
Basque Country in many characteristics,some
of which are not directly measuredin our data.
In particular,at the end of Franco's dictatorship,
both the Basque Country and Catalonia were
highly industrializedregions, and both had historical demands for self-governance, which led
to the firsttwo regionalautonomystatutesof the
post-Francoera in 1979. Since then, autonomy
statuteshave been grantedto the rest of Spanish
regions; however, Catalonia and the Basque
Country have always been among the regions
with the highest degree of political autonomy.
While in both regions large fractionsof the populationhave traditionallydemandedhigherlevels
of self-governance,Catalonianeverexperienceda

The weighted combination of Spanish regions

high accuracy up to the late 1980's. During
1990-1997 Catalonia outperformed the synthetic control by around4 percent in per capita
GDP. This gap does not come as a surpriseif we
consider the heavy investments and economic
expansion that Catalonia experienced during
that period as a result of the 1992 Summer
Olympic Games hosted in Barcelona. Since

FIGURE 4. A "PLACEBO STUDY," PER CAPITA GDP FOR CATALONIA

Catalonia is the main contributorto the synthetic control for the Basque Country, an abnormally high level of per capita GDP for
Catalonia during the 1990's may artificially
widen the GDP gap for the Basque Countryin
Figure 1. Therefore,our placebo study suggests
that, while per capita GDP for Cataloniacan be
reasonablywell reproducedby our techniques,
the catch-up in per capita GDP for the Basque
Countryduring the 1990's (relative to the synthetic control region) may have been more pronounced than what Figure 1 indicates.
C. Discussion
As noted earlier, the Basque Country has
been the main scenario of the terroristconflict.
However, ETA has also operatedin other Spanish regions. Even though there is no indication
that entrepreneurshave abandonedSpain as a
result of the terroristthreat, Basque terrorism
might have imposed a negative reputationalexternalityon other Spanish regions, and foreign
investment might have chosen alternativedestinationswith no terroristconflicts. If it is in fact
the case that the Basque terroristconflict has
had a negative economic effect on otherSpanish
regions, this effect is arguablyweaker than the

economic effect of terrorism on the Basque
Country. To the extent that the regions which
form the syntheticcontrolmight have been economically hurt by the conflict, our estimated
GDP gap would provide a lower bound on the
economic effect of terrorism on the Basque
Countryeconomy. On the other hand, the conflict may have diverted investment from the
Basque Countryto other Spanish regions, artificially increasing the magnitude of the gap.
However, since the size of the syntheticBasque
Countryis much larger than the actual Basque
Country,this type of bias is arguablysmall.12In
the next section we show evidence that support
the view thatthe effect of the conflict was small
outside the Basque Country.
A more importantcriticism of the analysis in
this section is that, as long as the synthetic
control cannot reproduceexactly the characteristics of the Basque Country before terrorism,
the GDP gap may have been created by differ12For the 1964-1975 period, GDP for the synthetic
region was 2.5 times largerthan GDP for the Basque Country;this figureincreasedto more than 3 duringthe terrorism
era. Furthermore,investmentdiverted to regions other than
those in the synthetic Basque Country does not affect the
validity of our analysis.

ences in growth predictorsbetween the Basque
Countryand the synthetic control before terrorism [columns(1) and (3) in Table 3], or by other
differences not reflected in our data. In particular, it might be argued that the GDP gap was
caused by the higher industrialconcentrationin
the Basque Countryin the pre-terrorismyears,
since terrorism developed during a period of
industrialdecline, when many industrialplants
closed. In fact, the industrial share of GDP
declined 17 percentagepoints (from 45 percent
to 28 percent) for the Basque Country during
the 1964-1993 period. The industrialshare of
the GDP decreased 15 percentagepoints (from
38 percent to 23 percent) for the synthetic control during the same period. Notwithstanding
the potential importance of this criticism, we
believe that differences in industrialdecline between the Basque Country and the synthetic
control cannot fully explain the GDP gap between the two regions during the 1980's and
1990's. As discussedearlier,the GDP gap seems
to respondto the intensityof the terroristactivity
in the Basque Country.Such associationis consistent with the interpretationthat the gap was
caused by terrorism,and would be left unexplainedunderthe alternativeexplanationthatthe
gap was generatedby a more pronouncedindustrialdecline in the Basque Country.13
Figure 5 graphs population series for the
Basque Country,the syntheticcontroland Spain
(the series are normalizedto 100 in 1964). The
population of the Basque Countryand the synthetic control grew at similar rates during the
late 1960's and the early and the mid-1970's,
well above the rate for the whole country.In the
late 1970's and early 1980's the patternsof the
series changed dramatically;populationgrowth
decelerated for the synthetic Basque Country
and Spain, and became negative for the Basque
Country.The results on the per capita GDP gap

The connections between the oil crisis and the decline
of industrialcenters in Europe during the 1970's and the
1980's has been noted by Derek H. Aldcroft (1993) and
others. To check that the association between the intensity
of terrorismand the gap does not arise artificially from a
differentialeffect of the oil crisis in the Basque Country,we
repeated the impulse-response analysis including contemporaneous and lagged values of oil prices as additional
exogenous variables.The coefficients on the oil prices variables were not statistically significant and their inclusion
left the estimated impulse-response function for terrorist
activity on the gap virtually unchanged.

Once the population dynamics are considered,
the gap in per capita GDP documented in this
section becomes even more striking.
Finally, it is worth noticing that the results in
this section are consistent with the findings in

III. Using ETA's 1998-1999 Truce
as a NaturalExperiment
A. Analytical Methods and Main Results
On September 16, 1998, ETA announced a
cease-fire (starting on September 18, 1998).
Fourteenmonths later, on November 28, 1999,
ETA announced the end of the truce. Table
4 presents a chronology of some of the most
importantevents relatedto the truce. Anecdotal
evidence suggests that the truce was not perceived as crediblefrom the beginning (note, for
example, the Spanish government's reaction to
the announcement of the cease-fire in Table
4, event number4). In fact, ETA had declared
other cease-fires in the past, but none of them
lasted more than three months; the previous
one, in 1996, had only lasted one week.14 Peace

prospects became more realistic as time passed
without terroristactions and the Spanish government confirmed contacts with ETA. Three
months before the end of the truce the situation
deteriorated as the Spanish government announced that the process was paralyzed.
If financialmarketsare efficient, asset prices
should reflect all available information and,
thus, react only to new information.Therefore,
if the terroristconflict was perceived to have a
negative impact on the Basque economy,
Basque stocks (stocks of firmswith a significant
part of their business in the Basque Country)
should have shown a positive performancerelative to non-Basque stocks (stocks of firms
withouta significantpartof theirbusiness in the
Basque Country)as the truce became credible.
Similarly, Basque stocks should have performed poorly, relative to non-Basque stocks,
at the end of the truce. In this section, we use
the method of event study to explore these
questions.

political negotiation (event 1 in Table 4). This declaration
and the subsequentannouncementof the truce were interpreted by many nonsubscribing parties as maneuvers of
Basque nationalistparties to create a united front to pursue
independence.

A challenge with this exercise is that there is no
obvious way to classify stocks into the Basque/
non-Basque categories. A classification that relies
solely on companies' registered addresses seems
problematic. Registered addresses are sometimes
chosen for historic, convenience, or tax-related
reasons and do not necessarily imply that the
company has an important presence in the area.
Unfortunately, data on geographical location of
firms' activities are rarely available. To solve this
problem we adopted a simple and direct approach.
Since what is relevant for our event study is which
companies were perceived by the markets as carrying a significant part of their business in the
Basque Country, we asked a group of market
analysts at a certain Basque financial institution to
produce this classification for us. We used this
information to divide stocks into Basque stocks
and non-Basque stocks. Again, the idea is to label
firms which have a large part of their business in
the Basque Country as Basque stocks, even if they
are not located in the Basque Country. All other
firms with little exposure in the Basque Country
were labeled as non-Basque stocks.15
We collected series of daily stock returns

Basque and non-Basquestocks used for the
analysis is provided in Appendix B, Table B2.

In contrast with more conventional event
study settings, where most of the informationis
revealed duringshortevent windows, the informationalcontent of the truce evolved gradually
during a 14-month period. Therefore, to study
the effect of the truce it is importantto control for long-run risk factors in stock returns.
Fama and French (1993) have identified three
common risk factors in stock returns, which
compose the often-called Fama-FrenchThreeFactor Model:

Size is the marketvalue of all outstandingsharesof a

book value of a stock to its market value. Size and the

November of 1999 represents the end of the
truce). The Basque portfolio outperforms the
non-Basque portfolio for most of the truce period except at the beginning (when the ceasefire had not gained credibility) and at the end
(when the cease-fire lost credibility).
To perform a statistical test on the effect of
the truce we added two dummy variables to
equation (1). Good News, takes a value of one
for the period between the tradingsessions after
event 5 and event 7 in Table 4, and a value of
zero otherwise.Bad Newst takes a value of one
for the periodbetween the tradingsessions after
event 11 and event 14 in Table 4, and a value of
zero otherwise. The Good News period comprises 22 trading sessions and the Bad News
period 66. During the Good News period, the
credibility of the truce gained ground, starting
with the offer of a revision in the policy towards
ETA activists in jail, if peace consolidated, by
the Spanish Prime Minister (event number 5),
and culminatingwith the announcementof the
authorizationof directcontactswith ETA by the
Spanish government(event number7). In contrast, the Bad News period was characterized
by the collapse of the peace process, starting
with the acknowledgment that contacts had
been interrupted,made by the Spanish Prime

Minister (event number 11), and ending with
the announcementof the end of the truce by
ETA (event number 14). Columns (3) and (4)
of Table 6 report the regressions including
the dummy variables Good Newst and Bad
Newst. The estimated coefficients on the
dummyvariablesrepresentaveragedaily abnormal returns during the Good News and Bad
News periods for the Basque and non-Basque
portfolios. As expected, for the Basque portfolio, the coefficient of Good Newst is positive and significant while the coefficient of
Bad Newst is negative and also significant.For
the non-Basque portfolio, the effects are small
in magnitude and not statistically different
from zero, which supportsthe view that Basque
terrorismhas a minor impact on the economy
outside the Basque Country. The last column
of Table 6 shows the result for the difference
regression. The dependent variable for the
difference regression is the difference in excess return between the Basque and the nonBasque portfolios. The difference regression
can be interpretedas the one that corresponds
to the portfolio of a passive investor who takes
a long position in Basque stocks and a short
position in non-Basque stocks. This regression
reflects a positive abnormal performance of

The performancesof the Basque and the nonBasque portfolios during the Good News and

is worthnoting that the results in this section do
not depend on the adoption of this particular
model. Two othermodels of normalreturns,the
Market Model and the Constant-Mean-Return
Model are perhaps the most common in the
event study literature(see John Y. Campbell et
al., 1997). These two models can be expressed
as special cases of the Fama-French ThreeFactor Model:
RJ= yJ + AJR, + AR' (MarketModel),
RJ-=

J + ARJ (Constant-Mean-Return
Model),

C. AlternativeModels

whereARJis again a zero mean abnormalreturn
for portfolioj and period t. Columns (1)-(6) in
Table 7 report the results of using these two
alternativemodels of abnormalreturnsin lieu of
the Fama-French Three-Factor Model. The
Market Model in columns (1)-(3) produces
results very similar to those in Table 6. The
Constant-Mean-ReturnModel in columns (4)(6) is less suitable to study long-run returns
because it assumes that expected returnsdo not
vary during the sample period. Using the
Constant-Mean-ReturnModel, the Basque and
non-Basque portfolios behave similarly during
the Good News period; however, the nonBasque portfolio outperformsthe Basque portfolio during the Bad News period.
Three-Factormodel
Althoughthe Fama-French
is perhaps the most widespread multifactor
model of portfolio returns, other factors have
been proposed in the finance literatureto explain stock returns.In particular,factors related
to the termpremiaand the defaultrisk premiaol
bonds have been proposedfor thatpurpose(see,
e.g., Nai Fu Chen et al., 1986; FamaandFrench,
1993). The results in Fama and French (1993)
show that these type of term and risk structure
factors may have explanatory power beyond
that of Rm, SMLt, and HMLt in a time-series
regressionof stock returns.Columns (7)-(9) in
Table 7 show the estimated coefficients for the
portfolio regressions when two additional factors, TERMtand DEFt, are included to reflect
the term and default risk premia of bonds, respectively.20 The coefficients of the term and

B. Discussion
Notice that if most of the new information
during the Good News and Bad News periods
was revealed in certain trading sessions, the
analysis in this section would provide conservative inference about the effect of terrorism,
because the coefficients on the Good Newst
and Bad Newst dummiesreflect averageabnormal returnsduring these periods. Even so, the
coefficients on the Good Newst and Bad
Newst dummies are statistically significant at
conventional levels.
To better understandthe magnitude of the
effects described in this section it is useful to
compoundthe daily effects for the Good News
and Bad News periods. Compounding the
0.0044 coefficient on the Good Newst dummy
over the 22 tradingsessions of the Good News
period, we obtain a compoundedabnormalreturn of 10.14 percent for the Basque portfolio
relative to the non-Basqueportfolio. Analogous
calculations yield a -11.21-percent compounded abnormalreturnfor the Basque portfolio relativeto the non-Basqueportfolioduring
the 66 tradingsessions of the Bad News period.
These are sizable differences which would be
difficult to explain unless they are attributedto
the differentialeffect of the truceon Basque and
non-Basque stocks.

IV. Summary and Conclusions

Much has been said about the pernicious effects of political conflict on the economy. However, to date little case study researchhas been
produced on this matter. This article presents
evidence of a negative economic impact of the
terrorist conflict in the Basque Country. The
first partof this study shows a 10-percentaverage gap between Basque per capitaGDP and the
per capita GDP of a comparable synthetic region without terrorismwhich emerges over a
period of two decades. Moreover, changes in
the per capita GDP gap are shown to be associated with the intensityof terroristactivity. The
second part of this study uses the 1998-1999
cease-fire as a natural experiment to measure
the effect of the conflict on the marketvalue of
a sample of Basque and non-Basque firms. We
show that Basque stocks outperformed nonBasque stocks as the truce became credible. At
the end of the cease-fire, Basque stocks showed

ments were not significant and did not change the coefficients of interest in any meaningful way.

a negative performancerelative to non-Basque
stocks.
Although we focus here on the Basque
conflict, the methods applied in this article can
be used to investigate the economic effects of
conflicts elsewhere. The applicationof the techniques in this article to the study of other conflicts will also shed light on the robustness of
the procedureand serve as cross validation.
Research of this sort could potentially have
an undesirable impact if terrorists learn that
their actions affect the economy negatively, assuming that is what they want to do. However,
we do hope that, as Paul S. Nelson and John L.
Scott (1992) found thatmedia attentiondoes not
cause terrorism, academic attention does not
cause terrorismeither.

V such that per capita GDP for the Basque

Data on terroristactivity (deaths and kidnappings) are providedby the Spanish Ministry of
Interior(2002). Regional data on GDP, investment, population density, and sectoral production come from Fundacion BBV (1999). Data
on human capital for different regions have
been collected by Mas et al. (1998). In some
instances, the series were only available on a
biennial basis. In those cases, annual figures
were interpolated as simple averages of the
years immediatelypreceding and following the
missing years. The regions used for the analysis
are the 17 autonomous communities of Spain
(leaving out the small autonomous towns of
Ceuta and Melilla on the coast of Africa). Oil
prices come from the OECD statisticalcompendium CD-ROM. Data on stock prices, firm size
(marketvalue of outstandingshares), book equity, and dividends are routinely collected by
the MadridStock Exchange(www.bolsamadrid.

of Spain. Data on macroeconomic announcements can be found at the Spanish National

There are infinitely many equivalent solutions
for V* [if V* is a solution so is V*(c) = c *V*
for any positive scalar c], so we can normalize
the Euclidean norm of V* (or any positive diagonal element of V*) to one.

The synthetic region chosen in this manner
produced a larger GDP gap during the terrorism years than the one chosen to reproduce
economic growth predictors. However, this
procedure could be less appropriateto construct counterfactual per capita GDP paths,
since it does not take into account information
about known determinantsof economic growth
(like sectoral composition or human-capital
endowments).
