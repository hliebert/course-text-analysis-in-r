Summary. Randomized trials remain the most accepted design for estimating the effects of
interventions, but they do not necessarily answer a question of primary interest: will the pro
gramme be effective in a target population in which it may be implemented? In other words,

are the results generalizable? There has been very little statistical research on how to assess
the generalizability, or 'external validity', of randomized trials. We propose the use of propen
sity-score-based metrics to quantify the similarity of the participants in a randomized trial and
a target population. In this setting the propensity score model predicts participation in the ran
domized trial, given a set of covariates. The resulting propensity scores are used first to quantify
the difference between the trial participants and the target population, and then to match,
subclassify or weight the control group outcomes to the population, assessing how well the
propensity-score-adjusted outcomes track the outcomes that are actually observed in the pop
ulation. These metrics can serve as a first step in assessing the generalizability of results from
randomized trials to target populations. The paper lays out these ideas, discusses the assump
tions underlying the approach and illustrates the metrics by using data on the evaluation of
a schoolwide prevention programme called 'Positive behavioral interventions and supports'.

intervention works under ideal circumstances, often including a rather homogeneous set of
participants (Flay, 1986). As defined by Campbell (1957), page 297,
'The second criterion is that of external validity, representativeness, or generalizability: to what popu
lations, settings, and variables can this effect be generalized?'.

Effectiveness trials are a step in the direction of generalizability, in that they assess whether the
intervention works in real world conditions, with a broader set of participants (Flay, 1986). How
ever, even effectiveness trials rarely are done by using participants who are representative of the
target populations in which the interventions being evaluated may eventually be implemented
(Rothwell, 2005a). Statistical methods to assess the generalizability of results from effectiveness
trials to target populations are needed (National Institute of Mental Health, 1999; Institute of

Medicine, 2006).
This paper focuses on the aspect of generalizability that is related to differences in the char
acteristics of participants in an effectiveness trial and in a target population. Participants in
effectiveness trials are rarely representative of the target population of interest and effects of
ten vary for different types of people and in different contexts. This combination means that
the results that are seen in a randomized trial may not reflect the effects that would be seen
if the intervention were implemented in a different target population (Flay et al., 2005). As
an example, one explanation for discrepancies regarding the effects of hormone replacement
therapy for post-menopausal women in the 'Women's health initiative' randomized trial and the
'Nurse's health study' observational study is differences in the types of women in the two stud
ies (Grodstein et al., 2003), although other possible explanations have also been provided
(Hernan et al, 2008). Another example relates to recommendations concerning breast con
servation versus mastectomy for women with breast cancer; the General Accountability Office
was concerned that the results that are obtained from randomized trials may not carry over to
women in general medical practice and so also used observational data methods to estimate the
effects for a broader group of women (Rubin, 2008). This issue is similar to that of the represen
tativeness of results from Web-based surveys where respondents opt in for participation; some
recent work has investigated implications for survey research, but without a focus on studies
estimating causal effects (Couper and Miller, 2008).
The work in this paper is related to proposals to use weighting-based approaches to estimate
effects for a target population by using data from a randomized trial (e.g. Shadish et al. (2002),
Cole and Stuart (2010), Haneuse et al. (2009) and Pan and Schaubel (2009)). These proposals
use ideas that are similar to Horvitz-Thompson estimation for sample surveys and inverse prob
ability of treatment weighting (IPTW) for non-experimental studies (Lunceford and Davidian,
2004), but where the trial sample is weighted to represent the population. In this paper we take
a step back to develop diagnostics to help researchers to determine when such generalizations
may be possible and reliable, and we also investigate other propensity score approaches in addi
tion to weighting. Almost no metrics for this purpose are currently available. Glasgow et al.
(2006) discussed the need for considering and measuring the 'reach' of an intervention in terms
of participation and representativeness of patients but they discussed only very simple metrics.
The state of the art currently is simply to compare the covariates one by one and to make qual
itative statements regarding the similarity of subjects in a trial and some target population, but
it can be difficult to summarize across many covariates. The work that is described here aims to
provide summary measures of representativeness with respect to observed pretreatment char
acteristics. In particular, we investigate the use of propensity scores to measure and quantify
differences between the participants in a randomized trial and a target population and we use
results from the propensity score literature on how to quantify differences between two groups

and to determine how large a difference is too much for reliable comparison, applying those
results to a new area.

The methods proposed are illustrated by using a randomized trial of a schoolwide behav
iour improvement programme: 'Positive behavioral interventions and supports' (PBIS) (Sugai
and Horner, 2006). The trial involved the random assignment of 37 public elementary schools
from five Maryland school districts to the PBIS programme or a control condition (Bradshaw

et al., 2009). Primary outcomes of interest include behaviour and academic performance, as
measured by student discipline problems, school climate and student test scores. We also take

advantage of school level data that are available for all elementary schools across the state of
Maryland. The question of interest is how similar the schools in the trial are to those across the
state, and whether the results from the trial might hold across the state of Maryland; this is the
policy question that is of interest to policy makers deciding whether or not the PBIS programme
should be recommended or implemented state wide. This paper focuses on the statistical ideas
and concepts; future work will discuss more of the substantive issues that are associated with

the PBIS programme itself and generalizing its effects.

This paper outlines the main idea behind using propensity scores to measure similarity of
participants in and out of a randomized trial and illustrates it by using the PBIS data. In partic
ular, Section 2 describes previous work in methods to assess or enable generalizability. Section

3 then proposes two diagnostic measures that use propensity scores to help to quantify how
similar the subjects in a trial are to the target population. Section 4 applies those measures to
the motivating example of the PBIS programme, and Section 5 concludes.

2. Previous work assessing generalizability

To this point, the emphasis of research has generally been on internal validityâobta

ased effect estimates for the participants in a trial. Less attention has been paid

validityâaddressing whether those participants are representative of the target pop
whether the effects are generalizable (Imai et al., 2008). The following two sections d
methods that have been used to assess generalizability, first in terms of study desig
and then in terms of data analysis techniques.

2.1. Study design
To provide a framework for thinking about these issues, Imai et al. (2008) decomposed the
estimation error in the estimate of a population treatment effect (A) into components due to
sample selection and to treatment assignment:

A = (Asx + As â) + (Atx + Ajy),
where S refers to bias due to sample selection and T refers to bias due to treatment selection. The

subscript X refers to observed variables and U to unobserved. Different study designs focus
on different quantities. For example, randomized experiments have Ajx = At,; = 0 but may
have larger Asx and Asâ than do observational studies. Observational study methods such as
propensity score matching (Stuart, 2010) focus on reducing At*, and sensitivity methods such
as in Rosenbaum (2002) assess the potential effect of Ajt/ on study conclusions.
Relatively less attention has been paid to the size of Asx and As(/ in randomized experiments.

Standard methods that make qualitative arguments regarding the generalizability of results

assume that the results from the trial directly carry over to the population: that As* = As(/ = 0.
In this paper we focus on methods to assess the amount of sample selection bias due to observed

covariates, Asx. Although there may still be bias due to As,,, the methods that are discussed
here at least provide a way to reduce bias in A due to Asx.
One of the most straightforward ways of ensuring the generalizability of results from random
ized trials is to enrol in the trial a representative sample from the target population. However,
only a handful of studies have used random assignment of a fully representative (e.g. random)

sample from a population to estimate programme effects (Cook, 2007). Examples include the
national evaluations of'Upward bound' (US Department of Education, 2009) and 'Head start'
(US Department of Health and Human Services, 2010), although even that 'Head start' evalu
ation excluded certain centres, such as those that were underenrolled and those serving Native

American populations. Increasing attention has been given to practical clinical trials, which
aim to enrol a very large and diverse sample of patients, from a range of settings (Peto et al.,
1995; Insel, 2006). However, those trials require large amounts of time and money and are not

always feasible. There has also been some discussion of purposively sampling units that are
either heterogeneous (to reflect the range of units that are in the target population) or that are
typical of that population (Shadish et al., 2002), but those ideas seem to have been rarely used
in practice, at least in a formal way.

2.2. Study analysis
Another strategy is to use existing data to assess the generalizability of existing studies, which

is the approach that we take here. Other methods in this area include meta-analysis (Hedges
and Olkin, 1985; Sutton and Higgins, 2008), cross-design synthesis (Prevost et al., 2000) and the
confidence profile method (Eddy et al., 1992). Many of these approaches aim to model treatment
effects as a function of study parameters, such as randomized versus non-randomized, and the
explicit inclusion-exclusion criteria, and they generally rely on having a relatively large set of
studies to include in the analysis. Unfortunately there is often only one or two studies from which
conclusions can be drawn. In addition, little attention is usually paid to the types of participants
who are enrolled in the various studies included, and how variation in their characteristics may

affect the results.

Perhaps the most common way of generalizing results to a target population is through
post-stratification, which reweights the effects based on population distributions. As a simple

example, imagine a target population with 50% males and 50% females, but a randomized
trial that had 20% males and 80% females. A simple post-stratification would estimate effects
separately by gender and then average the male and female effects by using the population pro
portions (50-50). Post-stratification can be very effective when there are only a small number
of variables to control for, but it is infeasible when there are many (or continuous) variables,

leading to a very large number of post-stratification cells. Frangakis (2009) discussed a more
complex scenario for post-stratification, where generalizability also depends on post-treatment
variables. Post-stratification is closely related to methods that model treatment-by-covariate

interactions to investigate whether effects vary across individuals (e.g. Rothwell (2005b) and
Wang et al. (2007)). In fact investigation of subgroup effects and effect heterogeneity is a crucial

step in determining what covariates are crucial to control for in the methods that we propose,

as discussed further below.

Weisberg et al. (2009) posited a simple model to account for differences between a trial sample

and a population due to inclusion or exclusion criteria, for a setting with a binary outcome.
They provided formulae for the amount of bias that may be created and showed that, depending
on whether high risk patients are particularly included or excluded, the estimated effect may

change considerably, or even reverse sign. In work that is probably most similar to that presented
here, Greenhouse et al. (2008) provided a case-study of assessing generalizability, comparing the
characteristics of paediatric participants in randomized trials of antidepressants to the general

population of children and adolescents. That work represented an important advance in raising
this issue, in the context of an important policy question regarding antidepressants and suicidal
tendencies.

3. Using propensity scores to assess generalizability
3.1. Formal setting
We consider a setting where a randomized trial has been conducted to estimate the effect of
a programme P relative to a control condition C on a sample of participants ^ of size n. By
'programme' we mean any intervention of interest, whether preventive or a treatment for a

particular disorder or disease. The participants in may be individuals or they may be at a
higher level, such as communities or schools, as in the case of the PBIS programme. In the
trial the programme P has been randomly assigned to participants in forming a programme
group and a control group that are only randomly different from each other on all background
characteristics. Interest is in determining the effectiveness of the programme P in a target popu
lation of size N, which is represented by f1, where ^ is a subset of Â£L We refer to 'J as the 'sample'

and 0 as the 'population'. In the PBIS example, vp consists of the 37 schools in the effectiveness
trial; fi consists of all public elementary schools in the state. We assume that for all participants

in (or a representative sample of them) we observe a set of background characteristics X,
which describe both the participants themselves and their broader contexts. In the PBIS study,
X consists of characteristics such as test scores, enrolment and demographics.

For subject i we denote membership in the randomized trial sample by Si, T) indicates
membership in the treatment versus control group (which is only defined for those with 5, =

1) and F,(l) and F,(0) are the potential outcomes under treatment and control respectively
(Rubin, 1977). Following the notation in Imai et al. (2008), the treatment effect for individual i
is the difference in potential outcomes, F,(l) â F, (0), although results could be extended to other
functions of the potential outcomes, such as their ratio. The standard intent-to-treat estimates
from a randomized trial, such as a difference in means of the outcome in the treated and control
groups, yields an unbiased estimate of the sample average treatment effect SATE:

SATE = - Â£ F,(1)-F,(0).
n ie{S(=i}

However, our estimand of interest is the population average treatment effect PATE:

PATE = if; F,(1)-F,(0).
N i=l

When the treatment effect is constant PATE = SATE, but that will generally not be so. Al
though PATE is a clearly defined measure of impact in a given population, in many research
settings the target population changes over time or space. In such cases, there may be more
than one PATE that is of interest. For a simple setting with one effect modifier, Cole and Stuart

(2010) have given an equation for the bias, which depends on
(a) the proportion of the population that is not sampled,
(b) the heterogeneity in the treatment effects,

(c) the prevalence of the effect modifier in the population and
(d) the strength of the association between the effect modifier and sample selection.

3.2. Key assumptions
We make three primary assumptions. Assumption 1 is that, given X, all subjects in the popula
tion have some probability of being selected for the trial:

0< P(Si = l\Xi)<\ for all X,-.

Assumption 2 is that there are no unmeasured variables that are related to both sample

tion and the treatment effect (Â£( A$u) = 0), which we term 'unconfounded sample selecti

also Cole and Stuart (2010)). This assumption is similar to the assumption of ignorab

ment assignment in observational studies (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983a) or the 'missingn

random' assumption with respect to missing data (Rubin, 1976). Formally, assumptio

that sample selection is independent of the potential outcomes, given the observed covar

5Â±[y(0),F(l)]|X.
Assumption 3 is that treatment assignment is random (and hence independent of the potential
outcomes) and independent of sample selection, given the observed covariates:

r_L[s,r(0),r(i)]|x.
The combination of assumptions 1 and 3 also implies that each subject has a positive proba
bility of receiving the treatment, which is comparable with the assumption of'strongly ignorable

treatment assignment' in Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983a).
The validity of assumption 1 depends on the definition of the target population. In settings
where some individuals in the initial target population would never receive the treatment of
interest (e.g. a targeted intervention that is only given to at-risk students who have already
exhibited some problem behaviours), the target population should be redefined to include only
those individuals to whom the treatment may be given. Assumption 3 is met in randomized
trials where the random assignment is done after the sample selection, and where treatment
assignment depends only on observed characteristics X. It thus arguably is not an assumption
per se; we include it here for completeness. Assumption 2 is arguably the most difficult to meet
and relies on having all potential moderators of the treatment effect measured. This assumption
is discussed further below.

Given these three assumptions we discuss two diagnostics for generalizability, both based
on the propensity score: first, the average propensity score difference between the sample and

the population, and, second, the use of propensity score methods to compare observed and
predicted outcomes under control for the population.

3.3. Propensity score distance as a measure of similarity
The first diagnostic tool that we propose is the propensity score distance between the partic
ipants in the trial and the target population, as a way to summarize their similarity. Here,
the propensity scores model the probability of being in the randomized trial. The propensity
score is typically defined as the probability of receiving some programme (or 'treatment') ver
sus a comparison condition, given a set of observed baseline characteristics (Rosenbaum and
Rubin, 1983a). Propensity score matching, subclassification or weighting can help to ensure
that the programme and comparison subjects being compared in a non-randomized study are
as similar as possible. This is done by comparing groups of subjects with similar propensity

375

scores, who, by virtue of the properties of the propensity score, will also have similar dis
tributions of the observed background covariates. In this way, propensity scores attempt to
replicate a randomized experiment in the sense of comparing subjects who did and did not receive
the treatment who have no systematic differences on the observed covariates (Ho et al., 2007;
Stuart, 2010).

Here, to summarize differences between the trial sample and the target population, the
propensity score will model membership in the randomized trial sample, rather than receipt
of the treatment. In particular, we use a logistic regression model of the probability of being in
the randomized trial (S) with the covariates X as predictors:

where /?,â  = P{Si = 1|X(). We use pt to denote the estimated probability of sample selection for
subject /. In a connection to the discriminant function, these propensity scores serve as the scalar
summary of the covariates that distinguishes the most between the trial participants and the

target population (Rubin and Thomas, 1992). They thus can provide a summary measure of
the similarity (or dissimilarity) of the trial participants and the population: just as propensity
scores can be used to identify when treatment and control groups are too far apart for reliable
causal inference (Rubin, 2001), they can be used also to identify when a sample is too different
from a population of interest to yield reliable generalizations.

We define the propensity score difference between the trial sample and population (Ap) as
the difference in average propensity scores between those who are in the trial and those who are
not in the trial:

If the sample is actually a (very large) random sample from the population, then we would
expect essentially no difference in the mean propensity scores between those sampled and not

sampled. In that case, Â£"(/?,â¢ |S; = 1) = E(pi\Si = 0) and Â£(AP) = 0. As we shall see later in the
PBIS example, in finite samples, there is likely to be a small positive value for Ap, reflecting small
chance differences between the trial participants and the population. When there are systematic

differences between the trial sample and population we shall expect that these means will be
quite different. In the standard propensity score context of observational studies, simulation
studies and theoretical approximations that were originally developed in the context of match
ing within propensity score calipers (Cochran and Rubin, 1973; Rubin, 1973) have indicated
that propensity score means that differ by more than 0.25 standard deviations indicate a large
amount of extrapolation and heavy reliance on the models being used for estimation (Ho et al.,
2007; Stuart, 2010), although this is by no means a set criterion, and in fact some researchers
recommend a more stringent criterion of 0.1 (Mamdani et al., 2005).

3.4. Using propensity score methods to match the control group to the population and to
compare predicted and observed outcomes
A second way in which we can use the propensity scores to assess generalizability is by using

propensity score methods to make the control group look like the target population and to
compare the predicted outcomes under control with the outcomes that are actually observed in
the population. We discuss three methods here: IPTW, full matching and subclassification. All
three of these methods can be thought of as weighting the control group to the population; the

E. A. Stuart, S. R. Cole, C. P. Bradshaw and P. J. Leaf

methods vary in the coarseness of the weights, with subclassification the coarsest and IPTW
the finest. In fact, IPTW can be thought of as an extreme where the number of individuals and

subclasses goes to oo (Rubin, 2001).
IPTW methods give each individual their own weight, which is calculated as the inverse
propensity scores, i.e., in our setting, the inverse probability of being in the sample: vv,(X,) =

1 /pj(Xj). These are conceptually similar to the weights that are used in non-response adjust
ments in survey sampling (Kalton and Flores-Cervantes, 2003). This weighting forms a pseudo
population with characteristics that are similar to those of the target population. If no one in
the population was receiving the intervention of interest, then, if the weights are effective, the

weighted control group outcomes should be similar to the outcomes that are observed in the
target population. Mathematically, we can extend results in Horvitz and Thompson (1952) and
Lunceford and Davidian (2004), where the expectations are taken over the target population:

Y( 0)

E{l(S=l)}{l-l(r=l)|r(0),X}

E[w(X){ l-e(X)}
â r y(Â°)

Â£[w(X){l-e(X)}

P(S = 1 \X = x){ 1 - P(T = 1 \X = x)}

= Â£{7(0)}.
In this expression e(X) reflects the probability of treatment assignment, e(X) â P(T = 1|X),
which is known in a randomized experiment. The above equations show that the probability of
treatment assignment and trial participation-weighted control group mean will be an unbiased
estimate of the population potential outcome under control, given the assumptions that were
detailed above. In this way we can use the similarity of the weighted control group means to the
population means as a diagnostic for how well the generalization is likely to work.
However, a concern about IPTW methods is that the results can be somewhat unstable, espe
cially if there are extreme weights, and the method is more sensitive to the specification of the

propensity score model than are other propensity score approaches (Kang and Schafer, 2007).
We thus also consider two other methods of reweighting the control group to resemble the
population, which use coarser weights. At the other extreme, subclassification methods form a
relatively small (e.g. 5-10) number of subclasses and group individuals with similar propensity
score values (e.g. by the quintiles of the propensity score distribution). However, subclassifica
tion approaches can suffer from having too few subclasses and thus insufficient bias reduction

(Lunceford and Davidian, 2004; Stuart, 2010).
We thus also consider a third approach: full matching (Hansen, 2004; Stuart and Green, 2008),

which can be thought of as a compromise between IPTW and subclassification (Stuart, 2010).
Full matching forms a relatively large number of subclasses, where in our use each subclass will
have at least one member of the sample and at least one member of the target population, but
the ratio of sample to population members in each subclass can vary. The subclasses reflect the
fact that some areas of the propensity score space will have relatively few sample members and

many population members, whereas other areas will have relatively few population members
and many sample members. Full matching has been shown to be optimal in terms of reducing
propensity score differences within subclasses (Rosenbaum, 1991).

For both subclassification and full matching the control group members in the trial are given

weights that are proportional to the number of population members in their subclass. For
example, sample members in a subclass with two sample members and 10 population members

would receive weights proportional to 5 (10/2), whereas sample members in a subclass with
10 sample members and two population members would receive weights that are proportional to
0.2 (2/10). For details on the construction of the weights following full matching see Stuart and

Green (2008).

4. Applying methods to 'Positive behavioral interventions and supports' study
We now apply the diagnostic tools that were described above to the group-randomized trial
of the PBIS programme, which is a schoolwide prevention programme that aims to improve
school climate by creating improved systems and procedures that promote positive change in
staff and student behaviours (Sugai and Horner, 2006). It is being widely disseminated by the
US Department of Education and many state governments. By 2010, over 10000 schools across
the USA, representing approximately 10% of all US public schools, were implementing the PBIS

programme (see http: //www.pbis. org) (Technical Assistance Center on Positive Behav
ioral Interventions and Supports, 2010). Because the intervention operates at the school level,
the unit of analysis is the school.

We combine information from two data sets to illustrate the use of propensity scores for
assessing generalizability. First, the randomized effectiveness trial of the universal system of

schoolwide PBIS, which was called 'Project target' (PT), began in 2002 among a sample of 37
Maryland public elementary schools that volunteered for the study (Bradshaw et al., 2009).
Those 37 schools were randomized to treatment and control in two years (2002, 2003); for our
illustrative purposes here we pool the two years. Second, we have longitudinal data on all public
elementary schools across Maryland, from 1993 through to 2007. This provides the population
data that are necessary to estimate the probabilities of participation in the trial and to compare
the schools in the trial with schools across the state.

State level co-ordinated training is required to implement the PBIS programme. The state
of Maryland has a mechanism for training schools in the PBIS programme, which was used
to train both the PBIS schools in the trial and non-trial schools that chose to implement the
PBIS programme (Barrett et al., 2008). Because some elementary schools were implementing the
programme outside the trial, as the target population we consider the 717 elementary schools
in the state that had not implemented it by 2006 and that were not participating in the PT trial;
subsequent use of the term 'state population' refers to this subsample of the full state population.
Excluding the schools participating in the trial from the state population of interest increases
clarity and precision.
We consider variables that were measured in 2002 as pretrial covariates and examine outcomes
measured in 2003 and later. Observed characteristics of the schools (both in the trial and state
wide) include characteristics of the students (e.g. the percentage of students classified as special
education, the percentage who qualify for free or reduced price meals and average mathematics

and reading test scores), as well as of the schools themselves (e.g. enrolment). Schools in the
PBIS trial are somewhat different from the population of elementary schools across Maryland
on these observed characteristics (Table 1). In 2002, the schools that were enrolled in the trial
had somewhat lower test scores, more students eligible for title 1 (a measure of poverty) and
higher rates of suspension than other schools across the state.
To summarize these differences, a propensity score (logistic regression) model was fitted pre
dicting membership in the PT trial given the set of characteristics in Table I. Fig. 1 shows the

distribution of propensity scores among schools across the state and for the schools in the PT
trial. In general there is overlap of the propensity scores, with many of the trial schools in the
range of propensity scores with high density among the schools across the state, but also with
a number of the trial schools with relatively large propensity scores. We can also quantify this,
in that the difference in average propensity scores between the schools in the trial and those

across the state (Ap) is 0.055. The standardized difference (standardized by the standard devi
ation of the propensity score) is 0.73, which is a substantial difference, and a size indicated by
Rubin (2001) to lead to unreliability of standard regression modelling because of the resulting

extrapolation.
We can also compare these differences with what would be expected in repeated random
draws of the same size. This allows us to determine what size propensity score difference we

would expect if the schools in the trial were in fact selected randomly from the population.
Fig. 2 shows the distribution of the difference in mean propensity scores between sampled and
unsampled schools, given repeated samples of size 37 drawn from the population of Maryland
public elementary schools that had not implemented the PBIS programme by 2006. Because the
propensity score is defined relative to a particular sample, the propensity scores themselves are
recalculated within each random sample. Whereas a propensity score distance of approximately
0.02 would be expected, our observed difference of 0.055 would happen in only 24 of 1000
samples randomly drawn from the population. Similarly, whereas a standardized difference of
size 0.5 would be expected, only three of the 1000 samples that we drew had a standardized
difference as large as our observed value of 0.73.
We then used the three propensity score adjustment methods that were described above
(IPTW, full matching and subclassification) to match the control group in the PT trial to

represent the population. We used three outcomes for this illustration: the percentage of third
grade students scoring proficient or higher on the yearly statewide reading and mathematics
examinations and the percentage of students who were suspended during the school year. The

bold curve shows the average value for each outcome, averaged across all schools in the state
that were not implementing the PBIS programme and not in the trial, over the time period from

2003 to 2005. The broken curve shows the same average, but calculated by using the control
schools in the trial. The large distance between the broken curve and the bold curve illustrates the
overall difference between the schools in the trial and those in the state: on average, the schools

in the trial had lower test scores and higher rates of suspension than those across the state. The
thin curve shows the average for the control schools in the trial, but weighted by using weights
calculated from propensity score full matching. For all three outcomes, and especially the test
scores, the trial control schools' weighted average tracks the true state mean quite closely, which
is seen by the similarity of the two full curves in each panel of Fig. 3. This is particularly true for
outcomes in 2003-2004, which is expected given that the propensity scores were estimated by
using variables that had been measured in 2002 and before. Interestingly, using IPTW seemed
to track the population outcomes slightly better than full matching, whereas subclassification
tracked the population outcomes slightly less well. Future work should further compare these

approaches and their use in generalizing trial results. These results indicate that, despite the
apparently large differences on the pretreatment covariates, when weighted appropriately, the
schools in the trial may help us to learn about population effects across the state of the PBIS
programme on third-grade mathematics and reading tests and rates of suspension.
5. Discussion

Propensity scores offer a promising way to assess the similarity between a tria
population of interest. However, there is still much work remaining in this
that were presented here assume that individual level data are available for t
at least for a representative sample from that population. This type of data
readily available, through nationally representative data sets or through adm
such as Medicare claims, Veteran's Administration records files or health sys
data sources. Similarly, the No Child Left Behind Act requires states to collec
records data on academic performance and discipline for reporting purposes.

where individual (or school) level population data may not be available, Co
have presented an alternative approach that uses only summary statistics on

interest.

An important question for this work regards variable selection and model e

issues may be informed by similar work in the broader propensity score litera

et al. (2006)); however, it will be important to consider whether the implicat
this setting. For example, it will probably be especially important to include
of the outcome, and particularly moderators of the treatment effects, in th
model. Because of this, it is also important for current trials to investigate e
and which covariates are effect modifiers. A related issue is how to weight t

that are observed. By default, propensity scores effectively weight each char

calculated by using those key characteristics (Rubin and Thomas, 2000). A second possible
approach is to combine propensity scores with the prognosis score methods that have recently

been developed by Hansen (2008). Prognosis scores effectively weight each characteristic by
how predictive it is of the outcome under control, F(0).
In many settings it is likely that both individual and contextual level factors moderate the

effects of interventions. For example, the effects of school-based smoking prevention pro
grammes may be moderated by both individual characteristics such as gender and race, but
also by the characteristics of the school and community. In the current study we have dealt with
this by incorporating both individual level measures as well as characteristics of the schools. In

other cases, where individual level data are available, a more direct way of doing so would be
to use a multilevel or hierarchical framework, in which the relationship between participation
in the trial and the individual and context level characteristics are modelled at separate levels:
one for individuals and one for the context. This is discussed in the context of randomized

experiments in Brown et al. (2008) and Hong and Raudenbush (2006).
The methods that were described in this paper assume that all the effect moderators are
observed (unconfounded sample selection). This is a crucial assumption, and it is important to
assess the validity of it. In the case of the PBIS programme, there has been very little research

into the effectiveness of the intervention (Bradshaw et al., 2010), and in fact the Maryland
trial was only the second randomized trial of the PBIS programme in the country (the other is

described in Horner et al. (2009)). Therefore, relatively little is known about potential school
level moderators of the effects of the PBIS programme. The theory of this intervention, and
of school-based interventions in general, leads us to believe that we probably observe most of

the major variables that may affect the effectiveness of the PBIS programme (e.g. academic
achievement and size of school). However, some important variables, such as the schools' orga
nizational capacity to implement the programme (Bradshaw et al., 2009), the Principals' support
for it (Kam et al., 2003) or the reasons why the Principals volunteered the school to participate
in the trial, are missing from these analyses. Although some of these data are available for the

schools in the trial, unfortunately none are available state wide. A potential consequence of
these possible unobserved confounders is that the methods that are described in this paper may
be more appropriate for some outcomes than for others. For example, we repeated the analyses
for fifth-grade test scores and found that there were still substantial differences between the

weighted control schools' outcomes and the average outcomes across the state. One potential
explanation for this varied performance across grades is possible unobserved differences in
problems of discipline between the schools in the trial and those across the state. Schools that
volunteered to participate in the trial may have done so in part because of relatively high dis

ciplinary problems, which tend to manifest themselves more in the later elementary school
years (Koth et al., 2009); the Principals of the participating schools may have felt more need
to participate in the trial to have the possibility of receiving the PBIS programme. Thus, even
when weighted by using the characteristics in Table 1, the fifth-graders in the trial schools may
have been more different from those across the state, especially compared with third-graders.

This would be an example of an unmeasured characteristic that differs between the sample and
population, which in particular may impact fifth-grade scores more than third-grade scores.
This may in part also be why the results for suspensions look somewhat worse than for third
grade test scores (Fig. 3). The diagnostics that are presented here can help to determine when
the weights are sufficient for generalization, or when unobserved variables are likely to cause
a problem, as seen for the fifth-grade test scores. Future work will also investigate methods

to assess the sensitivity of effect estimates to an unobserved moderator, along the lines of
Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983b).

As increasingly more high quality effectiveness trials are carried out, the clear next research
questions will involve external validity and generalizing the results from those trials. Some recent
work has started to investigate weighting methods to generalize results to target populations,

but diagnostics are first needed to help to determine when such generalization is reasonable.
The methods that were proposed here provide a first step towards assessing the similarity of

participants in a trial to those in a population, allowing researchers to begin to examine the
extent to which the results that are seen in trials may generalize more broadly. Assuming that
these diagnostics indicate that it is safe to proceed, future work should expand these approaches
to generate effect estimates for target populations of interest.
