Identifying and Estimating
Neighborhood Effects†
Bryan S. Graham*
Residential segregation by race and income are enduring features of urban America.
Understanding the effects of residential segregation on educational attainment, labor
market outcomes, criminal activity, and other outcomes has been a leading project of the
social sciences for over half a century. This paper describes techniques for measuring
the effects of neighborhood of residence on long-run life outcomes. ( JEL C51, I24, J15,

one-half times as likely to have a black neighbor relative to a counterfactual world without residential segregation by race.
Segregation, to borrow a phrase from
Durlauf (1996b), generates associational
inequality across identifiable ­subgroups. The
typical black adolescent in America lives in a
very different type of neighborhood, attends
a very different type of school, and is embedded in a very different type of social network,
than her white counterpart. Almost a half
century after the civil rights era, these differences remain poignant: an adolescent black
male at the turn of the century was three
times as likely to have reported witnessing
a shooting than his white counterpart (see
table 4).

different is itself a type of inequality. Minority
children tend to grow up in different social
environments than their white counterparts.
This observation, while s­elf-evident, is nevertheless important and, perhaps, too infrequently made. Society may legitimately have
direct concerns about associational inequality. More often, however, concerns are indirect: worries about segregation are related to
beliefs about its effects on other outcomes.
By generating inequality in social networks
and public goods important for the acquisition of human capital, segregation, so the
argument goes, contributes to inequality in
earnings, wealth, and other outcomes. This
argument has been frequently and elegantly
made (e.g., Loury 1977, 2002). Its quantitative assessment has been a leading, and
controversial, project of the social sciences
at least since the Coleman report (Coleman
et al. 1966).
Table 1 reports early adult outcomes for
a subsample of white, black, and Hispanic
respondents in the National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) cohort.
This cohort was born between 1980 and
1984, went through adolescence in the late
1990s, and is now in their thirties. The subsample includes respondents living in forty-four metro areas of the United States;
these metro areas are broadly representative of urban America, especially as it exists
in larger ­cities.2 ­­Black–white and ­Hispanic–
white e­ arly-adult outcome gaps are substantial. Blacks fail to complete high school at
twice the rate of, complete college at only
­one-third the rate of, score almost one standard deviation lower on the Armed Forces
Qualification Test (AFQT) than, earn about
2 The NLSY97 sample consists of 8,984 respondents. Of
these, 7,263 resided in one of 126 different MSAs at baseline in 1997. The analytic ­subsample discussed in the text
includes the 4,419 respondents that, at baseline, lived in an
MSA with at least five white NLSY97 respondent households as well as at least five black and/or five Hispanic
respondent households.

74 percent less than, and are incarcerated
at almost three times the rate of their white
counterparts (columns 1 and 2 of table 1).3
­Hispanic–white gaps in these outcomes are
also substantial, albeit less pronounced.
The facts presented in table 1 are at variance with many Americans’ own beliefs
about mobility. In a 2011 survey conducted
by the Pew Charitable Trust, 47 percent of
respondents strongly agreed that economic
success mostly depends on hard work and
drive, while only 27 percent of respondents
identified race and/or class background as
severe limitations to upward mobility (Pew
Charitable Trusts 2011).4
From the vantage point of a social scientist, the gaps reported in table 1 present a
puzzle. The conjunction of large measured
differences in outcomes across subgroups,
and the relative isolation of these subgroups
from one another due to residential segregation, motivates a focus on contextual or
neighborhood effects as a possible driver of
­intergroup inequality. The hypothesis, in a
very loose sense, is that “place” matters.
In thinking about this hypothesis, it is useful to make three, p
­olicy-relevant distinctions. Place may matter because expenditure
per pupil, teacher quality, access to good hospitals, and proximity to w
­ ell-paying jobs varies across neighborhoods. In principle, these
types of neighborhood inequalities can be
ameliorated by transferring resources across
space. The wave of school finance reforms
that began with the California Supreme

the following comes closest to your own point of view: A.
Whether or not a person gets ahead economically in this
country depends on drive, hard work and obtaining the
right skills; OR B. Circumstances beyond any person’s control—a person’s race, gender, and parents as well as the
quality of education available where they happen to live
can severely limit a person’s ability to get ahead economically?” Respondents could strongly or not so strongly agree
with either A or B, or say they didn’t know or were not sure.

Notes: Each row corresponds to a least squares fit of the listed outcome onto a constant, a black dummy, and a
Hispanic dummy (with baseline NLSY97 sampling weights used). The NLSY97 sample consists of 8,984 youths,
of which a total of 7,263 resided in an MSA at baseline (1,796 Hispanic respondents, 1,943 black respondents, and
3,524 non-Hispanic, non-black respondents). The estimation sample used here includes the 4,419 respondents who
resided in a MSA with at least five white responding households as well as five black and/or five Hispanic responding households (panel A). Panel B is based on the subset of 2,292 male respondents. Standard errors, clustered at
the household level, are reported in parentheses. “AFQT score at ‘age’ 16” corresponds to the inverse normal CDF
transform of the adjusted AFQT percentile score used in Altonji, Bharadwaj, and Lange (2012). This score was normalized to the distribution of percentile scores across NLSY79 respondents aged sixteen at the time of test taking
in 1980. Across respondents from the reference population of American youth ages fifteen to twenty-three in 1980
this transform of percentile scores is mean zero with unit variance. Since the Altonji, Bharadwaj, and Lange (2012)
percentile scores are normalized to a different reference group (both in terms of age of testing and year of birth),
“AFQT score at age 16” need not be mean zero with unit variance (across all 7,002 respondents with valid AFQT
scores its mean is −0.0001 and its standard deviation is 0.9893). AFQT and earnings were only available for a subset
of the target sample. The AFQT row of panel A is based on 3,291 respondents, while the earnings row of panel B is
based on the 1,879 male respondents with nonzero earnings.

Court’s ruling in Serrano v. Priest in 1971
generated transfers of this type. President
Obama’s Promise Zones initiative also represents an effort to channel more resources
into distressed neighborhoods. Kline and
Moretti (2014) review the economics of
“­place-based” policies.
Second place may matter because
the characteristics and behaviors of our

­eighbors directly influence key life outn
comes. If employment depends, in part, on
information and referrals from friends and
neighbors, then living in a disadvantaged
neighborhood, where few people are stably
employed, makes the acquisition of a job that
much harder. If learning depends, in part, on
being surrounded by able peers, then a child
in a classroom of advantaged children will

Graham: Identifying and Estimating Neighborhood Effects
learn more quickly than an identical child
in a classroom of disadvantaged children.
These types of neighborhood effects are peer
group effects or social interaction effects.
This source of inequality can not be ameliorated by transferring financial resources
across space. Reducing peer group inequality requires people to move across space; in
the words of Durlauf (1996b), associational
redistribution.5
Third place may matter because it represents a partially isolated arena of social
interaction. If individual decisions to study
hard, use drugs, or engage in delinquent
behavior depend, in part, on those of neighbors/peers, then there may exist multiple
equilibrium distributions of actions within
a neighborhood (Brock and Durlauf 2001a,
2001b, and 2007). Across two ex ante identical neighborhoods, one may converge to a
low drug use equilibria, another to a high use
­equilibria. In the presence of multiple equilibria policies that attempt to engineer “equilibrium shifts” can change the distribution of
outcomes within a neighborhood even in the
absence of resource transfers or associational
redistribution. Of course, the effects of these
first two types of interventions may also
vary with the structure of social interaction
among neighborhood residents.
My typology mirrors that given by Manski
(1993). Place may matter because of (i) correlated, (ii) exogenous/contextual and/or
(iii) endogenous effects. In this paper, I
principally review econometric methods
for the identification and estimation of
neighborhood effects of the second type.6
5 See Piketty (2000, p. 466) for a related discussion. A
referee made the valid point that while eliminating peer
group inequality itself requires associational redistribution, other types of resource transfers could ameliorate
the effects of peer group inequality. An example of such
a transfer is Title I funding, which is provided to school
districts with large numbers of economically disadvantaged
students.
6 The study of endogenous interactions raises distinct
issues, some of which are closely related to those addressed

453

The focus is methodological and no comprehensive review of the empirical literature is attempted, although empirical work
will feature prominently in the exposition.
Although peer group effects have be studied in other settings, most notably schools
(e.g., Angrist and Lang 2004; Graham 2008;
see Epple and Romano 2011 for a recent
review), my focus will be on their operation in the context of neighborhood of residence. This focus is partly expositional and
partly substantive. Its expositional value is
that it provides a common running example
throughout what follows. The focus is substantive because sorting into neighborhoods
is mediated by the housing market, for which
we observe a price. Other types of sorting,
for example into marriage and friendship,
generally occurs outside a formal economic
market. Studying the process of matching
and network formation in these settings, as
well as its effects on outcomes, is a topic of
great interest, but beyond the scope of this
paper (see G
­ oldsmith-Pinkham and Imbens
2013 and Graham 2017 for two recent treatment of problems of this type and Graham
2011, 2015c for surveys of other research).
Nevertheless, many of the points made
below will be relevant to researchers interested in “peer effects” broadly defined.
Section 2 presents basic information on
the scale of residential segregation by race
in the contemporary United States. This section necessarily briefly reviews techniques
for measuring segregation as well. After
documenting the scale of residential segregation, I present, in section 3, a series of
correlations or stylized facts on its “effects”
using geocoded data from the 1997 cohort of

by the burgeoning literature on the econometrics of games
(see de Paula 2013 for a review). My omission of this material is not meant to suggest its irrelevance, merely that a
careful treatment is best left for a separate survey. See section 5 for some additional comments.

454

the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth
(NLSY).
I establish that (i) the social contexts in
which black, Hispanic, and white adolescents are embedded differ substantially (on
average) and (ii) these “contextual gaps” are
larger for youth who reside in segregated cities (and, conversely, smaller for those who
reside in more integrated cities).7 While
the second fact follows almost axiomatically
from the first, documenting them motivates
the search for a causal connection between
neighborhood of residence and long-run life
outcomes.
Having established the degree of residential segregation and its correlation with contextual measures, section 4 turns to a review
of the evidence on what drives segregation. I
do not discuss the array of institutions, laws,
and policies which have historically exerted
a strong influence on neighborhood- and
school-level stratification. Sharkey (2013)
­
provides a recent synopsis of this material.
Other useful references include Massey and
Denton (1993), Schill and Wachter (1995),
and Dawkins (2004). Instead, my discussion
is on explanations for segregation that conceptualize it as an equilibrium outcome; one
where overt discrimination does not play
a role (e.g., Benabou 1993, 1996; Durlauf
1996a; Epple and Platt 1998; Nesheim 2002;
Fernandez 2003). My intent is not to discount the historical or continuing relevance
of “­nonmarket” drivers of sorting (cf., Yinger
1999; Ross and Yinger 2002), but rather to
narrow the focus to a domain where economics has a disciplinary advantage.
7 A note on nomenclature: first, in what follows I use
the word “white” to denote any ­non-Hispanic, ­non-black,
individual. Thus “whites” include A
­ sian Americans as well
as Native Americans. Second, by “city” I mean a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) as defined by the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB). I use 1999 OMB definitions (with a few minor differences described in Graham
and Sharkey 2013). MSAs include central-city cores as well
as adjacent suburbs. They provide a convenient approximation to a local labor and housing market.

The focus on ­
choice-based explanations
of segregation also foreshadows my discussion of identification. In identifying the
effect of neighborhoods on outcomes, the
econometrician must confront the fact that
the information set available to individuals
(or their parents) when choosing their residence is generally larger than that available
to her when she attempts to model their
effects. Consequently, observed neighborhood characteristics may be correlated with
unobserved individual characteristics, which
themselves drive the outcome of interest
(e.g., Mayer and Jencks 1989; Manski 1993).
Fortunately, the e­mpirically oriented
economist can lean on a rich theoretical
literature on locational sorting in order to
build intuitions and guide research design.
I attempt to provide a synoptic view of this
research that foreshadows the discussion of
identification and estimation in section 5.
Section 5 provides an overview of
approaches to identifying and estimating
neighborhood effects. Throughout, I focus on
measuring the effects of neighborhood racial
composition on outcomes. Of course, residential stratification also occurs along other
dimensions, most notably by income (e.g.,
Watson 2009; Reardon and Bischoff 2011).
My focus on residential segregation by race is
pedagogically motivated. Other types of segregation may be equally important or, more
interestingly, interact with racial segregation.
I ignore these and other complications.
I divide my discussion into two parts
based on the type of data available to the
researcher. First, I consider the case where
the researcher has access to matched
individual-neighborhood data, typically
­
from a single city. A prototypical dataset
of this type is the Los Angeles Family and
Neighborhood Survey (LA FANS), which
collects household- and n
­ eighborhood-level
data from Los Angeles families. These data
can be matched with tract-level data from
the US census (Sastry and Pebley 2010).

455

Graham: Identifying and Estimating Neighborhood Effects
The data collected in conjunction with the
Project on Human Development in Chicago
Neighborhoods (PHDCN) is also of this type
(Sampson, Sharkey, and Raudenbush 2008). I
also discuss what can, and cannot, be learned
from housing mobility experiments, such as
the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) program.
Second, I consider the case where
the researcher has access to matched
­individual-city data, typically for many cities.
Cutler and Glaeser (1997) provide an early
and ­
well-known example of this research
design. Here the analysis involves correlating i­ndividual-level outcomes with c­ ity-level
measures of sorting/segregation. This literature typically argues that aggregation reduces
biases due to sorting (e.g., Card and Rothstein
2007), I make this argument precise.
Section 5 briefly touches on other
approaches to identifying neighborhood
effects, such as methods based on structural
locational sorting models. Section 6 summarizes my thoughts about what directions
future work should take. No comprehensive
review of empirical work is attempted, nor do
I review all available research designs. My goal
is narrower. Specifically, by formalizing a stylized version of what empirical neighborhood
effects researchers have often done in practice, I attempt to illuminate the strengths and
weakness of common research designs, and
suggest incremental ways to improve upon
existing work. Readers interested in a more
comprehensive survey of existing empirical
work in economics and the other social sciences are directed to Durlauf (2004, 2006),
Durlauf and Ioannides (2010), Harding et
al. (2011), Sharkey (2013), Sampson (2012a)
and Sharkey and Faber (2014).

Residential Segregation by Race in
Contemporary Urban America

Table 2 lists, among those with a year 2000
population of at least 500,000, the ten most
racially segregated metropolitan areas in

the United States. The ranking is based on
the dissimilarity index (DI), a widely used,
albeit often misinterpreted, measure of segregation in social science research (Iceland,
Weinberg, and Steinmetz 2002). In order to
provide a precise definition of the DI, it is
helpful to establish some basic notation. I
will also use this notation in the exposition of
research designs in section 5 below.
Consider the population of individuals residing in a given metropolitan area (a
“city”). Let T
​ ∈ ​{0, 1}​​denote whether a random draw from this city is minority (​T = 1)​
or not ​(T = 0)​. Let ​Z​be an ​N × 1​vector with
a ​1​in the ​i th​row and zeros elsewhere when
the random draw resides in the i​th​ neighborhood (​i ∈ ​{1, … , N}​​). Here ​N​denotes the
number of neighborhoods in the city. Let
​s(z) = Pr ​(​T = 1 |​   Z = z)​​be the proportion
of neighborhood ​Z = z​that is minority. For
example, if z​ ​has a one in its third row and
zeros elsewhere, then ​
s(z)​gives the fraction of residents in the third neighborhood
that are minority. Finally let Q
​ = Pr​(T = 1)​​
be the ­city-wide frequency of minority residents. The DI equals
s(Z) 1 − s(Z)

where, to be clear, the expectation in (1) is
over the population of residents (not neighborhoods).8 In a perfectly integrated city,
each neighborhood’s racial composition
will mirror that of the city as whole (i.e.,
​s(Z) = Q​for all neighborhoods) so that (1)
equals zero. In a perfectly segregated city,
where no minority shares a neighborhood

which, in turn, accords with the definition given by Massey

Appendix A demonstrates that the DI
equals the c­ ity-wide proportion of minority
residents who would need to move in order
to achieve perfect integration, relative to the
proportion that would need to move under a
status quo of perfect segregation (cf., Jakubs
1977). Researchers routinely omit the relative qualifier (e.g., Cutler and Glaeser 1997;
p. 837).

Massey and Denton (1993, p. 20) suggest
that a DI of less than thirty corresponds to a
relatively integrated city, one between thirty
and sixty to a moderately segregated city, and
one greater than sixty to a highly segregated
city. Another point of reference is provided

by considering the degree of ­
segregation
in urban South Africa at the end of the
Apartheid era (where residential segregation
was forcibly imposed). Christopher (1994),
computing black versus ­
non-black dissimilarity indices using 1991 South African
census data, finds values of approximately
0.9. Since South African census enumeration areas contain only ­one-fourth as many
people as US census tracts (on average),
we might except South African segregation
measures to be somewhat inflated relative to
their US counterparts for purely statistical
reasons. With these benchmarks and caveats
in mind, the 0.79 DI for the Detroit metro
area in 2000 is extraordinary and substantiates the “two societies” language famously
used by the Kerner Commission to describe
urban America almost a half century ago.

Graham: Identifying and Estimating Neighborhood Effects
The spatial distribution of minority and
white residents in the ten cities listed in
table 2 is decidedly uneven. In each of these
cities, minorities and whites largely live in
separate neighborhoods; neighborhoods
with differing access to schools, parks, and
other public goods, differing exposure to
violence, and where individuals’ potential
­
networks of peers also differ.
Table 2 also lists the “­eta-squared” (​​η​​  2​​)
and isolation index (I) measures of segregation. The former has been widely used to
characterize sorting by economists following
Kremer and Maskin (1996). It has a longer
history in other disciplines (e.g., Farley 1977)
and will also arise frequently in the econometric analysis undertaken in section 5. To
give a precise definition of ​​η​​  2​​, it is helpful to
first define the isolation index (I). This index
equals the fraction of one’s neighbors who
are minority for the average minority resident in a given city or
	​
I = E​[​s(Z) |​  X = 1]​.​
While minorities make up only 26 percent
of the population in Detroit (column 3), the
neighborhood in which a typical minority
resides in is over t­hree-quarters minority
(column 4).9
The ​​η​​  2​​index coincides with the coefficient
on ​T​in the linear regression of ​s(Z)​onto a
constant and T
​ ​.10 As such, it provides a measure of the degree to which one’s own race
­predicts the race of one’s neighbors. Using
the fact that (i) ​T​is binary, (ii) ​cov​(T − s​(Z)​,

9 We

can also define white exposure to minorities as
​E

= E​[​s(Z)|​X = 0]​.​

Exposure coincides with the fraction of neighbors who are
minority for the typical white resident.
10 Here and in what follows I use “linear regression of
​Y​on ​X​  ” to denote the mean squared error minimizing linear predictor of Y
​ ​given a constant and X
​ ​(e.g., Goldberger
1991).

The ​​η​​  2​​index therefore provides a scaled
measure of minority isolation. It measures
the excess isolation of minorities in a city
compared to perfect integration (the numerator in (2)) relative to the corresponding
excess isolation that would be observed in a
perfectly segregated city (the denominator
in (2)).
The dramatic levels of minority isolation
in the ten cities listed in table 2 do not characterize all large metro areas in the United
States. Table 3 lists, again according to the
DI, the ten most integrated metro areas
(among those with at least 500,000 residents in 2000). In the ­
Vallejo–Fairfield–
Napa metro area of Northern California
almost one third of residents are minorities. However these residents live in neighborhoods that are only slightly more than
one-third minority (compare columns 3 and
4). For some of the cities listed in table 2,
Hispanics constitute a sizable fraction of the
total minority population. Prior research
has shown that Hispanics are ­
less segregated from whites than blacks, a distinction
glossed over in the aggregate statistics report
in tables 2 and 3 (e.g., Logan and Turner
2013). Nevertheless, as I will articulate
more precisely below, the lived experiences
of minorities and whites are measurably different in the cities listed in table 2 than they
are in those listed in table 3. Whether these
differences help explain other dimensions of
racial inequality is a key question that will be
evaluated below.
Although residential segregation by race
is pronounced in the United States, it has
undergone appreciable changes in recent
decades (e.g., Cutler, Glaeser, and Vigdor

1999). Figure 1 plots exposure indices for
blacks and Hispanic metro area residents
from 1970 to 2000. The exposure of blacks
to blacks corresponds to the isolation index
defined above. The exposure of blacks to
Hispanics corresponds to the fraction of
Hispanic residents in the average black person’s neighborhood, etc. Figure 1 indicates
that black isolation has declined from over
0.65 in 1970 to just over 0.50 today. This
decline reflects a more or less equal rise
in exposure to Hispanics (from 0.05 to just
over 0.10) and whites (from 0.30 to just over
0.35). The decline in black exposure to all
minorities (i.e., to blacks and Hispanics) has
been far less pronounced: from 0.71 to 0.64
from 1970 to 2000. In 1970 the typical black
metro resident lived in a neighborhood that
was a little more than two thirds minority, in
2000 she lived in a neighborhood that was a
little less than two-thirds minority.

In contrast to that of blacks, the experience of Hispanics from 1970 to 2000 has
been one of rising residential segregation.11
While in 1970, Hispanic exposure to whites
was over 55 percent, it had fallen to almost
40 percent by 2000. Hispanic exposure to
blacks increased, albeit modestly, while own
exposure, or isolation, increased sharply
from just under 0.35 to just over 0.45.
Overall Hispanic exposure to all minorities
increased from 0.44 to 0.58 between 1970
and 2000.
Segregation trends can be sensitive to the
measure used. Figure 2 plots minority (i.e.,
black and Hispanic) versus majority (i.e.,
white and Asian) dissimilarity and ​​η​​  2​​ indices
11 There is some nuance to this claim. The Hispanic
population has increased sharply in many metro areas, and
this demographic change would increase Hispanic isolation even in a perfectly integrated society.

sensitive to the measure used, high levels of
segregation by race, even in the post–civil

urban America.

associated with commensurate inequalities
in the social context in which minorities and
whites live, work, and socialize, should come
as no surprise. Nevertheless, since differences in school quality, social services, and
exposure to violence (among other factors)
across minority and white neighborhoods
are often asserted to be the mechanism by
which “neighborhood effects” operate, it is
worth documenting and measuring these
differences more precisely.
Table 4 reports b
­ lack–white and H
­ ispanic–
white gaps in a few measures of contextual
background for the subsample of NLSY97
respondents used to construct table 1. The
values of each of these variables are respondent reported, they measure youth perceptions, which may or may not be systematically
biased.

Blacks and Hispanics are less likely to
report feeling safe at school or that their
peers have college plans (rows 1 and 2).
Black and Hispanic males are almost twice
as likely to report that significant numbers of
their peers belong to gangs (row 3). Finally,
male black youths are three times more
likely to report witnessing a shooting prior to
turning eighteen than their white counterparts; Hispanics report witnessing a shooting
at twice the rate of whites.
The choice of measures included in table 4
reflects a combination of availability and
potential relevance. The two explicit peer
measures proxy for differential exposure
by race to peers engaging in “delinquent”
activities versus “human capital building”
activities. Models of peer influence hypothesize that peer behaviors can exert strong

i­
nfluences on adolescent behavior (e.g.,
Crane 1991). Peer interactions have been
hypothesized by a number of authors as a
major neighborhood effects mechanism.
The second two contextual measures capture different levels of exposure to violence.
In choosing these measures, I was guided
by two pieces (no doubt among others) of
emerging evidence on the role of violence in
“neighborhood effects.”
The first comes from the US Department
of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) Moving to Opportunity (MTO)
demonstration. A random subset of MTO
participants were given access to a housing
voucher to support relocation away from

traditional public housing projects. Ludwig
(2012) provides a basic overview of the MTO
demonstration. While access to the housing voucher was randomly assigned, participation into the experiment was voluntary.
Almost 80 percent of MTO participants
listed a desire to “get away from gangs and
drugs” as their primary or secondary reason
for wanting to leave their current neighborhood. Violence and safety themes also
emerge in various MTO f­ollow-up studies. I
will discuss what we can, and cannot, learn
about neighborhood effects from the MTO
evidence below.
The second reason for focusing on violence exposure measures, is due to its

462

Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. LVI (June 2018)

­ ypothesized effect on various human capach
ities (see Massey 2004 for an interesting survey and commentary). For example, Sharkey
(2010) compares scores on cognitive assessments given to youth just prior, or immediately after, a homicide in their neighborhood,
finding that the performance of the latter
group is significantly lower than the former.
His sample consists of Project on Human
Development in Chicago Neighborhoods
(PHDCN) respondents. Youth exposure to
violence is also correlated with lower levels
of self-reported health in early adulthood
(e.g., ­Boynton-Jarrett et al. 2008).
Table 4 documents high levels of contextual inequality among blacks, Hispanics,
and whites. Since context is a local concept,
one might conjecture that this inequality is greater (lower) in metro areas where
these groups live apart from (with) one
another. Tables 5 and 6 present evidence
confirming such a pattern. Let ​c = 1, …, C​
index cities and i​​NLSY97 respondents
within cities. Define T
​ = Black + Hispanic​
to be a “minority” dummy and let
​s​(z)​  = Pr​(​T = 1 |​  Z = z)​​remain as defined
above (i.e., the fraction of minority residents
in neighborhood ​Z = z​). Let ​​Yc​  i​​​ be a given
contextual measure and consider the following regression model:

E​[​s(​ Z)​|​ ​Tci​  ​​  = 0]​​ are exposure gaps. In a
perfectly integrated city, these two terms
will equal zero, in a perfectly segregated
city, where whites live separately from all
minorities, they will equal one. Hence​​
­lack–white “conb​ B​​​gives the expected b
text gap” in a perfectly integrated city and
​​bB​  ​​  + ​c​ B​​​the expected gap in a perfectly segregated city. The interpretation of ​​b​ H​​​ and​​
b​ H​​  + ​c​ H​​​is analogous. These are predictive
statements and, as such, can be viewed as
“facts” (albeit with some parametric structure on the form of ​E[​ ​​Yci​  ​​|​ ​Wci​  ]​​ ​​ maintained).
Their implications will be discussed more
critically below.12
The “a” columns in tables 5 and 6 report
the coefficients associated with the least
squares fit of each of the four context variables onto M
­ SA-specific constants and the​
black​and ​Hispanic​dummy variables alone.
The estimated context gaps are similar to
those reported in table 4, which made no
allowance for ­
cross-MSA differences in
context. While the distribution of blacks,
Hispanics and whites is not uniform across
MSAs, these differences do not drive the
contextual gaps documented in table 4.
Instead, it is w
­ ithin-MSA differences that
12 As these “facts” are based on a random sample, it is
worth reminding the reader that uncertainty, due to sampling variability, remains. However this component of
uncertainty is quantifiable and captured by the standard
errors reported throughout.

also unsurprisingly, contextual inequality
is far greater in America’s most segregated

table 5). Blacks self-report exposure to peers
with college plans at about 70 percent of the
rate at which whites do. However in integrated cities there is only a small exposure
gap, while in segregated cities blacks report
exposure at just over one-half the rate whites
do (see panel B of table 5). Hispanic exposure to peers with college aspirations also
varies systematically with the degree of residential segregation.

Graham: Identifying and Estimating Neighborhood Effects
For the two violence exposure measures,
the connection with residential segregation
is both sharp and dramatic. Unconditionally,
blacks report witnessing a shooting at three
times the rate whites do. Almost half of black
youths report witnessing a shooting by age
eighteen. The ­black–white gap in violence
exposure varies substantially across cities, however. In relatively integrated cities,
blacks witness shootings at just over twice
the rate of their white counterparts. In segregated cities they do so at almost four times
the rate (table 6, panel B).14
The evidence presented in tables 4 to 6
indicates the minority youth live in meaningfully different types of neighborhoods
than their white counterparts. They live with
peers who, on average, on more likely to
belong to gangs and less likely to have college plans. They attend schools that feel less
safe and are exposed to violence at a greater
rate. These contextual gaps, unsurprisingly,
are more pronounced in segregated cities.

What Drives Segregation?

The previous section documented substantial levels of residential sorting by race
and income. It also documented how measured sorting correlates with specific measures of the social contexts in which youths
live. Blacks and whites, for example, are
exposed to different peers and levels of violence. These gaps are largest in segregated
cities, where the two groups tend to live
apart. These facts raise the question of why
blacks and whites live apart? While there are
very important historical, institutional and
policy reasons for widespread segregation
(cf., Sharkey 2013), in this section I will focus
14 The shooting exposure rates derived from the
NLSY97 are consistent with those from other surveys.
Finkelhor et al. (2009), using the National Survey of
Childrens Exposure to Violence, report that 22.2 percent
of 14  –17 year olds were exposed to a shooting.

on explanations of segregation as an equilibrium ­by-product of decentralized sorting by
households.
At least since the work of Tiebout (1956),
economists have modeled household neighborhood choice in terms of utility maximization. Tiebout (1956) concluded that
neighborhood sorting was efficient: the combination of multiple communities, majority
voting for public expenditures within communities, and heterogeneous valuations of
public goods allows households to choose a
community with a level of public good provision (and associated tax rate) that closely
aligns with their preferences. Households
vote with their feet.
Bewley (1981) provided several counterexamples which illustrated different ways in
which a sorting equilibrium could diverge
from a social planner’s assignment of households to communities. This theme was further developed, with a particular emphasis
on the effects of social spillovers, in a series
of papers published in the 1990s (e.g.,
de Bartolome 1990; Benabou 1993, 1996;
Durlauf 1996a; Becker and Murphy 2000).
Piketty (2000), Fernandez (2003), and
Durlauf (2004) survey this literature. Here, I
provide a synoptic sketch of this work.
The model is a two-period one.15
Household utility depends on first and second period consumption, U
​ ​(​c​ t​​  , ​c​ t+1)​​ ​​. There
are two types of households, ​
t ∈ ​{0, 1}​​.
Without intending to be pejorative I will call​
t = 1​and t​= 0​households, respectively,
“high” and “low” type households (representing advantaged and disadvantage households
respectively). In period one, households
choose a neighborhood of residence. All
neighborhoods are ex ante identical; ex post
they vary in the fraction of high type families
that live in them. Let ​​s​ c​​​ denote the fraction
of high type families in community ​c​.
15 See Benabou (1996) for an overlapping-generations
extension.

In period t​​, households are exogenously
endowed with income y​ ​​ t​​​. They choose their
neighborhood of residence and optimal level
of debt, ​​d​ t​​​. Since housing is homogenous,
and all neighborhoods are ex ante identical,
the price of housing in community ​c​ depends
only on the fraction of high-type households
there. The period ​
t​budget constraint is
therefore
(4)	​​c​ t​​  + p​(s)​  = ​y​ t​​  + ​dt​  ​​  , ​
with ​p(​ s)​​denoting the price of a home in a
neighborhood with composition ​s.​
In period ​t + 1​households realize income
(5)	​​y​ t+1​​  = t​m​ H​​​(s)​+ ​(1 − t)​ ​m​ L​​​(s)​.​
Period ​t + 1​income depends on the “quality” of neighborhood chosen in period ​
t​.
Equation (5) captures the possibility that
human capital acquisition may be facilitated
by exposure to high-type peers, which, in
turn, increases future wages. Assume that
both ​​m​ H(​​​ s)​​ and ​​m​ L(​​​ s)​​are increasing in ​s​,
then period t​ + 1​income, holding own type
constant, will be higher for those households who choose neighborhoods with many
high-type residents. Equation (5) provides
a reduced form representation of how peer
spillovers influence the human capital accumulation of children. This could be due to
direct peer effects or because, say, the tax
base in high-type communities supports better schools.
Households face a simple ­trade-off: purchasing a home in a higher quality neighborhood increases future income (and hence
second-period consumption), but at the cost
of reducing first period consumption. The
presence of a credit market, which allows
home purchases to be at least partially
financed, complicates the analysis; but not
essentially.
In period t​ + 1​, households also pay off
all debt (principal plus interest). Let r​ ​​H​​​

and ​​r​ L​​​denote the interest rate available to
high- and low-type borrowers. If credit markets are perfect ​​r​ H​​  = ​r​ L​​  = r​. The second
period budget constraint is

Solving (4) and (6) for ​​c​ t​​​ and ​​c​ t+1​​​ and plugging into the utility function yields

To characterize how families t­ rade-off housing prices (or equivalently, period-one consumption) and neighborhood quality we

4.1 Equilibrium
Assume there is a continuum of e­ qually

candidate equilibrium neighborhood composition density. Feasibility of this equilibrium requires that

with ​​p​ H​​​the population frequency of hightype households (cf., Graham, Imbens, and
Ridder 2010).
Consider two neighborhoods, both with
fraction ​s​high types. Imagine a reallocation
of households to neighborhoods such that​
s​ increases by ​ds​in the first neighborhood
and decreases by ​ds​in second. Call the set
of households who actually change neighborhoods as part of the reallocation movers.
Each moving high-type household trades
homes with a moving low-type household.
Moving high-type households enjoy a higher
quality neighborhood ­post-move, while moving low-type households enjoy a lower quality neighborhood ­post-move.
The net present value of the change in
neighborhoods for high-type movers is

 ​  .​
1 + ​r​ L​​
If the sum of (10) and (11) is positive, then
the net gain to movers from the reallocation
will be positive. Consequently there will be a
set of transfers between high- and low-type
households that will sustain the reallocation

467

(e.g., by selling each other their houses at
differing prices). For ​ds​, infinitesimally small
positivity of the sum of (10) and (11) is equivalent to the condition

The l­eft-hand side of (12) is a measure of
local complementarity (in net present value
terms) between own and neighbor’s type. If,
at neighborhood composition s​​, condition
(12) holds, then moving high-type households will gain more from an improvement in
neighborhood quality than moving low-type
households will lose from a deterioration in
neighborhood quality. Condition (12) implies
that there exists a set of transfers between
a high- and low-type household such that
both can be made better off by switching
neighborhoods.
Note that Condition (12) coincides with

which, if it holds for all ​s ∈ ​[0, 1]​​, is called
a single-crossing condition. Single crossing
implies that high types’ willingness to pay
for a marginal improvement in neighborhood quality exceeds that of low types for
all values of s​​. As Benabou (1996, proposition 1) and others have shown, when (13)
holds for all ​s ∈ ​[0, 1]​​the equilibrium assignment of households to neighborhoods will
be completely segregated. Conversely, if
​R​(1, s)​  − R​(0, s)​  < 0​for all s​ ∈ ​[0, 1]​​, then
perfect integration will be the unique stable equilibrium (under simple ­
best-reply
dynamics).
The characterization of equilibrium when​
R​(1, s)​  − R​(0, s)​​changes sign is more complex, however, under b
­ est-reply dynamics, at
any ​s​on the interior of the unit interval for
which ​​f ​  eq
S​  (​​ s)​​is positive, it must be the case
that ​R (​ 1, s)​  − R​(0, s)​  < 0​.

468

Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. LVI (June 2018)

Condition (12) indicates that two forces
drive sorting. First, even if the human capital
benefit of a marginal improvement in neighborhood quality is the same for high- and lowtype households (​​ i.e., ​∇​  s​​ ​m​ H(​​​ s)​= ​∇​  s​​ ​m​ L(​​​ s)​)​​,
the equilibrium assignment of households to
neighborhoods will be segregated if r​ ​​ H​​  < ​r​ L​​​.
Credit market imperfections, which allow
high-type households to finance home purchases at more favorable terms than lowtype households, help to sustain a stratified
equilibrium. Differential access to credit
by blacks and whites has been an important
driver of residential segregation by race historically (cf., Ross and Yinger 2002). Under
limited liability constraints, access to credit
on favorable terms varies with socioeconomic status almost by construction.
Second, sorting may arise due to “technological” complementarity between own and
neighbor’s type. That is, even in the absence
of capital market imperfections, households
will sort into homogenous neighborhoods
if ​​∇​  s​​ ​m​ H(​​​ s)​> ​∇​  s​​ ​m​ L(​​​ s)​​(i.e., if the marginal
benefit, in terms of second period income, of
an improvement in neighborhood quality is
higher for high type households).
4.2 Efficiency
When two households “trade neighborhoods” in a decentralized housing market,
the desirability of the trade is evaluated
solely in terms of the costs and benefits of
the trade to the directly involved parties.
However, when a high-type household leaves
a neighborhood, it imposes costs on the
households left behind and provides benefits
to households located in its new neighborhood. These spillover effects are not internalized by a decentralized housing market.
The presence of these spillovers means that
the laissez faire assignment of households to
neighborhoods may be inefficient (even in
the absence of credit market imperfections).
The net benefits associated with a neighborhood trade depend on its implications both

for the directly involved movers, which are
fully internalized by the housing market, as
well as the implications for stayers, which
are not.
Since the social planner necessarily
discounts the future income of low- and
­high-type households equally, we may assess
the social efficiency of any candidate neighborhood assignment by studying its implications for the distribution of second period
income. Let
	​
m​(s)​  = s ​m​ H​​​(s)​+ ​(1 − s)​ ​m​ L​​​(s)​
equal the average second-period income
in a neighborhood of composition ​s​. If, as
before, we take two neighborhoods with ex
ante composition ​s​and move ​ds​high types
from one neighborhood to the other (and d
​ s​
low types in the opposite direction) the net
change in average income will be
m​(s + ds)​  + m​(s − ds)​  − 2m​(s)​
   
  
 ​  .​
	​​ __________________________

For ​ds​, infinitesimally small this change will
be positive if

The first term in (14) measures the “technological” complementarity between own
and neighbor’s type. The second term is
what Benabou (1996) calls curvature. If the
marginal benefit of an additional high type
is declining in the fraction of high types
already present in the neighborhood, then
reallocations that increase segregation may

469

be ­inefficient (even if own and neighbor’s
type are complementary).
Consider the following functional forms
for ​​m​ H(​​​ s)​​ and ​​m​ L(​​​ s)​​:

motivation for associational redistribution
(cf., Piketty 2000).

	​​m​ L​​​(s)​ =  ​α​  L​​  + βs − γ ​s​​  2​,

In the simple locational sorting model
outlined above, the only source of agent heterogeneity is their type, high versus low. In
practice there is w
­ ithin-type heterogeneity,
generally unobserved by the econometrician. To get some sense of how heterogeneity affects sorting, consider the following
simple (expositional) example. Assume that
the outcome, Y
​ ​, given residence in a neighborhood with composition S
​ = s​ is

	​
m​ H​​​(s)​ =  ​α​  H​​  + ​(β + ϵ)​s − γ ​s​​  2​  ,​
with ​β​, ​γ,​ and ϵ​ ​all positive. Under this technology, the marginal benefit of an incremental
increase in neighborhood quality is declining
for both low and ­high types. Concavity of this
type means that transfers of high types from
low ​s​to high ​s​neighborhoods will tend to
harm stayers on net. However the incentives
for sorting will be driven by complementarity between own and peer type, in this case
given by
	​
η​(s)​ = ϵ,​

so that for any ϵ​ > 0​, a high-type household
will always outbid a low-type household
for any marginal improvement in neighborhood quality: equilibrium will be stratified.16 However, for 0​ < ϵ < γ​, the overall
mapping of neighborhood composition into
average income is (globally) concave since​​
: stratification is
∇​  ss​​  m​(s)​ = 2​(ϵ − γ)​ < 0​
inefficient.
This example provides a rather dramatic
demonstration of a general theme that
emerges from the literature on locational
sorting in the presence of social spillovers:
when the private incentives to sort are misaligned with the social costs and benefits
from doing so, the laissez faire assignment
of families to neighborhoods need not be
efficient and, in some cases, may be grossly
16 To

keep things simple, the discussion abstracts
from credit market imperfections (i.e., I assume that
​​r​ H​​  = ​r​ L​​  = r​).

​Y(​ s)​= ​ ​

This model presumes that the outcome
increases linearly in s​​for both high and
low types, but at a rate which may be
­individual specific (due to variation in ​​A​ 1​​​).
Further, allow agent utility to differ from
the outcome of interest to the researcher.
Specifically the utility associated with residence in a neighborhood with composition​

There are two sources of unobserved heterogeneity in this model. Agents vary in the
sensitivity of their outcome to neighborhood
composition (variation in ​​A​ 1​​​) and may also
vary in their taste for s​​for reasons other
than its effect on ​Y​(variation in ​​A​ 2​​​). Assume

Agents with a high marginal utility of neighborhood composition will outbid those with
lower marginal utilities for spots in high s​​
neighborhoods.17
There are two neighborhoods of size one.
For simplicity, I also assume that there are
equal numbers of high and low types. Let
​​FH
​  (​​​ · )​​ and ​​FL​  (​​​ · )​​denote the distribution
function of expected marginal utility for high
and low types, respectively. Let ​​c​​  ∗​​ be the
expected marginal utility level that satisfies
(15)	​​F​ H​​​(​c​​  ∗​)​  + ​FL​  ​​​(​c​​  ∗​)​  = 1.​

17 To keep things simple, I assume that utility is directly
transferable across agents who trade locations.

Note that exactly half the population (highs
and lows together) has a marginal utility of
neighborhood composition greater than c​​ ​​ ∗​​
and half one less than or equal to ​​c​​  ∗​​. The
value of c​​ ​​ ∗​​that partitions the population into
two halves determines the nature of sorting
in this economy.
Assume that ​​β​  H​​  > ​β​  L​​​, ​​γ​  H​​  < ​γ​  L​​​  , and ​ρ ≤ 0​
such that, on average, high types value an
incremental increase in ​
s​more than low
types. Under these conditions, the high-type
neighborhood will have fraction ​​

​FH
​  (​​​ ​c​​  ∗)​ ​​high types while the low-type neighborhood with have fraction ​s = ​FH
​  (​​​ ​c​​  ∗)​ ​.​
Now say the econometrician attempts to
infer the marginal returns to an increase in​
s​for high types by comparing outcomes for
this group across the two neighborhoods:

sorting bias

High types in the two neighborhoods have
different observed outcomes, on average, for
two reasons. First, those individuals located
in the high ​S = ​s′ ​​neighborhood benefit from
greater exposure to high-type neighbors.
Second, the distribution of A​ 
​​ 1​​​ differs across
the two neighborhoods. High types in the
high ​
S = ​s′ ​​neighborhood tend to benefit
more from their high-type neighbors than
their counterparts in the low S
​ = s​ neighborhood would. This is sorting bias: the distribution of unobserved agent ability varies
with observed neighborhood composition.
Note that if ​ρ = 0​, so that knowledge of A​ 
​​ 2​​​
provides no information about the value of​​
A​ 1​​​, then the sorting-bias term will be zero.
Assessing households’ information sets is
often an important step in justifying particular identification conditions (cf., Graham,
Imbens, and Ridder 2010).

Graham: Identifying and Estimating Neighborhood Effects
Developing research designs that ameliorate the effects of sorting bias has been a
preoccupation, perhaps the central preoccupation, of neighborhood effects researchers
for at least three decades (e.g., Mayer and
Jencks 1989). The logic of simple sorting
models, particularly when augmented with
unobserved a­gent-level heterogeneity, can
be useful for developing intuitions about the
plausibility of different research designs in
particular settings.
5.

Research Designs for Identifying
Neighborhood Effects

Consider a cohort of individuals who reside
in a common metropolitan area during their
formative years, for example, individuals
born in the early 1960s who lived in the Bay
Area of California as teenagers. Diversity in
this population is characterized by the pair​​
(​A′ ​, T)​​. Here, ​A​is a vector of unobserved
individual attributes measured prior to, or
at the onset of, adolescence. The elements
of ​A​capture, among (many) other attributes,
innate cognitive ability, health endowments,
and family and ethnic background. An
agent’s observed type is given, as earlier, by
the binary indicator ​T​. In practice ​T​ might
be a race dummy or an indicator for whether
a child’s parents graduated from college or
not.
Let Y
​ ​be an outcome of interest. This
outcome is measured p
­ostadolescence;
examples include adult earnings, eventual
educational attainment, and incarceration
status by age twenty-eight. All exogenous
agent characteristics measurable at the onset
of adolescence and relevant for the determination of Y
​ ​are captured by (​​ ​A′ ​, T)​​. Since​
A​is unmeasured, and may be of arbitrarily
high dimension, this is without loss of generality. For convenience I will call A
​ ​ “background.” It should be recognized that this
reification is simply a shorthand for what is
typically a large bundle of both acquired and

471

innate ­attributes that help to determine Y
​ ​.
Continuing to keep the exposition concrete, I
will also refer to ​T = 1​households as minorities and ​
T = 0​households as whites. Of
course, other running examples are possible.
Individuals reside in one of ​i ∈ ​{1, …, N}​​
neighborhoods. Let ​
Z​be an ​
N × 1​ vector of neighborhood dummies. Let s​​(z)​
= Pr​(​T = 1|​  Z = z)​​be the fraction minority
in neighborhood Z
​ = z​, ​​m​ A(​​​ z)​= E​[​A|​  Z = z]​​
the mean background of residents living in
neighborhood Z
​ = z​, and U
​ ​additional unobserved ­
neighborhood-level characteristics.
Throughout what follows, I will take the joint
distribution of ​(A′, T)′​as given and invariant
across policies. In practice this means that
the elements of ​(A′, T)′​ are ­non-manipulable,
at least over the time frame in which the outcome is being measured. We conceptualize
(​A′, T′)′​as a bundle of fixed characteristics
that a household brings with them as they
move from neighborhood to neighborhood.
Behaviors, for example parenting style,
which may change with neighborhood of residence, are not elements of ​A​.
We will also view ​U​as a vector of exogenous location-specific characteristics (e.g.,
­microclimate, proximity to the ­city center
and so on). Its marginal distribution is invariant across policies. Other ­
location-specific
characteristics, for example the mill rate
on assessed property values, may vary with
the mix of residents living in a location (e.g.,
via the mechanism of majority voting). The
influence of these c­ omposition-induced policy changes on the outcome of interest are
“peer effects,” broadly defined.
A prototypical analysis of the effects of
residential segregation by race on ​Y​ begins
with the linear regression model

neighborhood effects, or more precisely,
spillovers, if the outcome varies with
changes in the neighborhood distribution
of household types and/or backgrounds
(i.e., ​​γ​  0​​  ≠ 0​ and/or ​​δ​  0​​  ≠ 0​). There are place
effects if any of γ​ 
​​ 0​​​, ​​δ​  0​​,​ and ​​κ​  0​​​ differ from
zero.
The predictive value of own type and background, ​T​and ​A,​ on the outcome is indexed
by ​​β​  0​​​ and ​​λ​  0​​​. The parameter ​​γ​  0​​​ measures
how the expected outcome changes with
the fraction minority in one’s neighborhood,
while ​​δ​  0​​​does so for changes in mean neighbor “background.” Finally κ​ 
​​ 0​​​ measures the
influence of U
​ ​, neighborhood “amenities,”
on the outcome.
I assume this equation is structural in the
sense of Goldberger (1991); specifically that
it is invariant across associational redistributing policies. Since we are free to define ​A​ and​
U​broadly, the assumption that (16) describes
a causal relationship, the linear conditional
mean assumption aside, is not especially
restrictive (cf., Wooldridge 2005). Recall that
the joint distribution of (​A′, T)′​, and the marginal distribution of ​U​is assumed invariant.
Therefore, equation (16) is structural in that
it provides accurate predictions for an individual’s outcome given an exogenous change
in her neighborhood environment. Put differently, the policies of interest are reallocations or, in the words of Durlauf (1996b),
associational redistributions. Equation (16)
is helpful for understanding how “who lives
with whom” influences the distribution
of Y
​ ​.
Let (16) be the long regression of
interest. The econometrician can compute the sample analog of the short
regression of the outcome onto a constant, own minority status and the

f­raction minority in one’s neighborhood of
residence:
(17) ​
E​[​Y|​  T, s​(Z)​]​ = ​a​ 0​​  + ​b0​  ​​  T + ​c​ 0​​  s​(Z)​.​
Prior reviewers of the empirical literature
on neighborhood effects have outlined a
variety of reasons for why c​ ​​ 0​​​ need not coincide with ​​γ​  0​​​and, more generally, why knowledge of relationship (17) may not be useful
for understanding the effects of reallocations
on the distribution of outcomes.
5.1 Sorting and Matching
Two concerns commonly raised by
reviewers of the neighborhood effects literature are biases due to sorting and matching. Graham, Imbens, and Ridder (2010)
formally define sorting and matching on
unobservables in the context of a ­nonlinear,
­non-separable, version of regression (16).
The linear form of (16) allows for a more
compact development of the key ideas,
but this is not without a loss of generality.
I begin with the mean regression representation of A
​ ​,
(18) ​
A = ​π​  0​​  + ​ϕ​  0​​  T + B,

E​[​B|​  T]​  = 0.​

Here, ​B​is the component of “background”
that does not vary, on average, with race.
It is convenient to partition unobserved
agent-level heterogeneity into a compo­
nent that varies with type and one that is
(mean) independent of it. Equation (18)
is nothing more than a decomposition.
Graham, Imbens, and Ridder (2010) work
with a variant of (18) appropriate for models where ​
A​enters ­
non-separably; they
provide additional discussion and motivation. Note that the “background gap”
between minorities and whites is given by
​​ϕ​  0​​  = E​[​A|​  T = 1]​  − E​[​A|​  T = 0]​.​
There is no sorting unobservables if an
individual’s neighborhood of residence, ​
Z​,
is not predictive of the B
​ ​component of her

473

Graham: Identifying and Estimating Neighborhood Effects
background conditional on her observed
type, ​T​:
(19)	​
E​[​B|​  T, Z]​  = E​[​B|​  T]​  = 0.​
The second equality in (19) follows by construction. Condition (19) implies that the
distribution of “background” (specifically
its mean) among, say, minorities is similar
across neighborhoods. If this is not the case,
then we say there is sorting on unobservables. For example, it may be that minority
families living in predominately white neighborhoods differ systematically in terms of A
​ ​,
from their counterparts in predominately
minority neighborhoods (e.g., their adult
members may have graduated from more
elite colleges). This captures the intuition
that observed neighborhood characteristics may be correlated with the unobserved
characteristics of its residents; a commonly
articulated concern in empirical analyses of
neighborhood effects (e.g., B
­rooks-Gunn
et al. 1993; Duncan and Raudenbush 2001;
Sampson, Morenoff, and G
­ annon-Rowley
2002; Kling, Liebman, and Katz 2007).
The previous section presented an example of how this could occur in a sorting
equilibrium.
Matching is a related but distinct process.
There is matching when the unobserved
exogenous attributes of one’s neighborhood
(e.g., proximity to the c­ity-center) can be
predicted by own type. There is no matching
on ​U​if
(20)	​
E[​ ​U|​  T]​  = E​[U]​.​
If, for example, minorities are less likely to
live in neighborhoods adjacent to employment districts, then we say there is matching
on U
​ ​.
5.2 Anatomy of the Short Regression
A large empirical literature fits models of the form given in (17), typically with

a­dditional individual- and ­
location-level
characteristics (see below for more on the
role of controls). How do these analyses
relate to the structural model (16)? After
tedious manipulation, it is possible to show
that the two slope coefficients in (17) equal18

minority, ​​η​​  2​​the ­eta-squared index of segregation defined earlier, and ​cov​(X, Y)​​ denotes

sorting on unobservables condition (19) we

Because the distribution of (​​​A′ ​, T)​′​ is

is a continuum of neighborhoods. Calculation details are

assumed invariant across reallocations, ​​
b​ 0​​​,
is a structural, albeit composite, parameter
when there is no sorting on unobservables.19
When condition (19) fails to hold, b​ 
​​ 0​​​ is not
structural, in the sense that its value is not
policy invariant. As is clear from inspection,
the third component of (21) varies with the
joint distribution of (​​ A′, T, Z′  )​′​, whose manipulation is precisely the goal of a reallocation
policy. If neighborhood of residence predicts unobserved background conditional on
observables (i.e., condition (19) fails), then
then ​​b0​  ​​​will not be useful for predicting the
effects of reallocative policies.
A similar set of observations apply to c​ ​​ 0​​​,
the coefficient on fraction minority, in (17).
It is this coefficient that purports to provide
a measure of peer group or neighborhood
effects. The third term in (22) depends on
the covariance between fraction minority in
a neighborhood and mean neighbors’ background. Although ​B​is mean independent
of T
​ ​, its neighborhood average need not be.
Consider a city where low ​
B​ households,
irrespectively of race, sort into predominately minority neighborhoods and high ​B​
households into predominately white neighborhoods. Under this type of sorting pattern,​
cov​(s​(Z)​, E​[​B|​  Z]​)​  = E​[​E​[​B|​  Z]​|​  T = 1]​  −
E​[​E[​ ​B|​  Z]​|​  T = 0]​​will be negative. This will, in
turn, bias c​ ​​ 0​​​ downward relative to ​​γ​  0​​  + ​ϕ​  ′0 ​ ​​  δ​  0​​​,
making exposure to minority neighbors
appear more detrimental for Y
​ ​than it would
be in the absence of sorting.
When there is no sorting on unobservables
the coefficient on fraction minority simplifies
to

19 When the distribution of (
​​ ​A′ ​, ​T′ ​)​′​is invariant across
the policies of interest maintaining an “inclusive definition
of type” is without loss of generality (cf., Graham, Imbens,
and Ridder 2010).

The first two terms in (24) are invariant
across reallocations, while the last is not.20
However, if we additionally impose the no
matching condition (20) the third term drops
out, leaving
(25)	​​c​ 0​​  = ​γ​  0​​  + ​ϕ​  ′0 ​ ​​  δ​  0​​  , ​
which does measure the causal effect of
exogenous changes in fraction minority on
outcomes.
I conclude that regression (17) is informative about neighborhood effects when conditions (19) and (20) hold. Specifically ​​b0​  ​​​ and ​​c​ 0​​​
are useful for predicting the effects of “doubly randomized” reallocations of households
across neighborhoods (Graham 2008, 2011;
Graham, Imbens, and Ridder 2010). First,
the social planner selects a feasible distribution of minority fraction across neighborhoods. If the status quo assignment is heavily
segregated, the planner may choose a more
integrated distribution. Second, she fills
minority and white “spots” in each neighborhood by taking independent random draws
from the populations of minorities or whites
as appropriate. Third, neighborhoods, so
formed, are assigned at random to locations.
Steps two and three of this procedure ensure
that the new neighborhood assignment obeys
the no sorting and matching restrictions. No
sorting and no matching require that individuals, conditional on their type, are “as if”
randomly assigned to groups and, further,
that groups so formed are “as if” randomly
assigned to locations.
Expressions (21) and (22) also provide
a framework for understanding conventional neighborhood effects analyses based
on observational data, where conditions
20 In practice we could replace the no sorting on unobservables condition with the weaker requirement that
cov​​(s​(Z)​, E​[​B|​  Z]​)​  = 0​
. However, the stronger condition
more naturally generalizes to semiparametric models
and is maintained here (cf., Graham, Imbens, and Ridder
2010).

Graham: Identifying and Estimating Neighborhood Effects
(19) and (20) are unlikely to hold. Consider
the effect of sorting on unobservables on
the coefficient on minority status. If high
“background” households, irrespective
of type, tend to be concentrated in predominately white neighborhoods, then
. Sorting by back​cov​(s​(Z)​, E​[​B|​  Z]​)​  < 0​
ground biases the coefficient on minority
upward, relative to the no sorting benchmark
case (cf., equation (23)). When the minority
population share is small (​p​small), and/or
segregation by race large (​​η​​  2​​big), the bias
will be even larger.
Now consider the coefficient on fraction
minority in (17). Terms three and four in
(22) are bias terms. The third term is proportional to the sorting bias term in (21). If
sorting follows the form sketched in the previous paragraph this term will be negative.
The fourth term is due to ­minority–white
gaps in l­ocation-specific amenities. If predominately minority neighborhoods have
characteristics that otherwise tend to lower
outcomes, then this term will be negative as
well. Collectively sorting and matching will
exaggerate any negative, or attenuate any
positive, impact of minority exposure on the
outcome.
These conclusions are specific to the
assumptions made about sorting on unobservables and matching; other assumptions
could lead to opposite results. The point of
walking through a specific example is to show
how the structure of the prototypical neighborhood effects regression analysis may be
utilized to be more precise about (i) assumptions needed for causal inferences to be valid
and (ii) how to think about likely biases when
causal inference is not warranted.
While conditions (19) and (20) are strong,
there are examples of real world datasets
where they are plausible. For example in the
Project Student / Teacher Achievement Ratio
class size reduction experiment, students
were first randomly grouped into classes (no
sorting), with classes then assigned randomly

475

to teachers (no matching) (see Graham
2008 for additional details and caveats). The
value of such experiments for enhancing our
understanding of peer group and neighborhood effects is considerable. It is illuminating
to consider a hypothetical housing mobility
experiment satisfying double randomization.
Consider a public housing authority that has
constructed new housing units in multiple
locations of a city. Among all households allocated to a new unit, the authority could (i)
randomly group sets of households together
(no sorting) and then (ii) randomly assign
these groups to different newly constructed
locations (no matching). This is not a completely implausible scenario, but it is also far
from the structure of any type of experiment
implemented to date.
5.3 Conditioning on Observed Householdand N
­ eighborhood-Level Attributes
In the context of observational neighborhood effect analyses, researchers’ reactions
to the biases caused by sorting and matching has typically been to improve measurement. Specifically, to add proxies for ​A​ and​
U​to equation (17). This approach has led
to innovative data collection strategies (e.g.,
the “ecometrics” espoused by Sampson and
Raudenbush 1999). Datasets like the Los
Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey
(L.A. FANS) include a rich array of theoretically motivated and carefully measured
family- and n
­ eighborhood-level proxies for​
A​and U
​ ​.
To understand how this approach work
in practice, let ​W​be a vector of predetermined h
­ ousehold-level attributes (e.g., parents’ schooling) and ​X​a vector of exogenous
neighborhood-level attributes (e.g., dis­
tance to closest major employment center).
Redefine a household’s unobserved “background,” B
​ ​, as
A = ​​π​  0​​​(W, X) + ​​ϕ​  0​​​(W, X)T + B,
E[B | T, W] = 0.

476

Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. LVI (June 2018)

There is no sorting on unobservables, conditional on W
​ ​and ​X​ if
(26)	 ​E​[​B|​  T, W, X, Z]​  = E​[​B|​  T, W, X]​  = 0​.
Condition (26) implies that among, say,
minority households (i) living in neighborhoods with the same observable amenities (​X​) and (ii) having identical measured
backgrounds (​
W​
), one’s neighborhood of
residence, ​Z​, is not predictive of the unobserved ­household-level determinants of ​Y​.
More concretely, it implies, for example, that among minority households with
­college-educated heads living in neighborhoods near a major employment center, the
average unobserved component of background, ​B​, is similar across neighborhoods.
There is no matching on unobservables,
conditional on ​W​and ​X​ if
(27)	​
E[​ ​U|​  T, W, X]​  = E​[​U|​  W, X]​  = 0, ​
or if, among households homogenous in W
​ ​
and X
​ ​, minority status is not predictive of
unobserved neighborhood amenities. Again,
concretely, it implies that c­ollege-educated
households living near major employment
centers, enjoy similar unobserved neighborhood amenities irrespective of their minority
status.
Let ​​E​​  ∗​​[​Y|​  X; Z]​​denote the best linear
predictor of Y
​ ​given ​
X​conditional on ​
Z​.
Wooldridge (1997, section 4) summarizes
the basic properties of conditional linear
predictors (CLPs). Under (26) and (27) the
conditional linear predictor of Y
​ ​given T
​ ​ and​
​ ​and ​X​, is given by
s​(Z)​​, conditional on W
(28) ​
E​[​Y |​  T, s​(Z)​; W, X]​
 	   = ​α​  0​​  + ​π​  0​​ ​(W, X)​′(​ ​β​  0​​  + ​γ​  0​​)​

In practice, researchers generally impose
the additional restrictions that ϕ​ 
​​0​​​(W, X)​
​ ​and X
​ ​) and
= ​ϕ​  0​​​(i.e., is constant in W
​​π​  0(​​​ W, X)​ = ​Π​  W​​  W + ​Π​  X​​  W​(i.e., is linear in W
​ ​and X
​​
). With these two extra
functional-formal assumptions, conditions
­
(26) and (27), provide a formal justification for
least squares “­kitchen-sink” ­neighborhoodeffects regression analyses (e.g., Datcher
1982; ­Brooks-Gunn et al. 1993; Leventhal
and B
­ rooks-Gunn 2000).
An interesting example of identification via
conditioning is provided by Bayer, Ross, and
Topa (2008). In that paper a neighborhood
corresponds to a census block, while ​X​ corresponds to a vector of census tract indicators.
Recall that census tracts contain multiple census blocks. In their setup, condition (26) rules
out ­
within-track sorting on unobservables;
an assumption they motivate by appealing to
frictions in the housing market (i.e., households may be able to choose their tract of residence, but probably not their exact block).
Condition (27) requires, effectively, that the
minority and white census blocks, within a
given tract, have similar neighborhood amenities. Hoxby (2000) and Ammermueller
and Pischke (2009) employ an analogous
research design to study peer effects at the
classroom level. With the increasing availability, albeit generally by special agreement,
of rich geocoded datasets, this approach to
identification may be useful to empirical
researchers.
My own view is that approaches based
on covariate adjustment, as in other areas
of causal analysis, have a meaningful role
to play in neighborhood-effects research.
Such approaches can motivate the collection
of better data, which often has other auxiliary benefits. Of course, as in other areas of
causal analysis, approaches based on covariate adjustment are not always compelling
(cf., Durlauf 2006). This observation has led
researchers to develop other research designs
for neighborhood-effects analysis.

Other Instrumental Variables Methods

the panel data structure of conventional
neighborhood-effects analysis. Under (16)

the ­between-neighborhood outcome equation equals

A large body of quantitative observational
studies on neighborhood effects is now
available. Early studies typically matched
household-level data from, for exam­
ple, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID), with n
­
eighborhood-level variables constructed from the census (e.g.,
­track-level poverty rate). An early example,
within economics, is provided by Datcher
(1982). More recent studies often utilize ­
special-purpose datasets, such as the
L.A. FANS.
Prior reviewers have generally been dismissive of this work. For example, Durlauf
(2006) argues that “with very few exceptions … empirical studies of neighborhood
effects based on observational data have
failed to deal seriously with the possible
statistical biases induced by ­self-selection
into neighborhoods” (p. 159). This assessment continues to be true today, but it
does not, in my view, imply that such work
is without value. The establishment of
robust conditional correlations provides
the library of “stylized facts” that theoretical, as well as more sophisticated empirical
work, should seek to explain. For example, it is a fact that the ­black–white gap
in many outcomes is greater in more segregated cities. Explaining this pattern is a
legitimate project for the social sciences.
At the same time it is correct that basic
observational studies are arguably of
only limited value in justifying, for example, policies of school and/residential
desegregation.
It is in this context that projects such as
the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) demonstration have arisen. The MTO program provided randomly assigned opportunities for
some households to leave public housing and
move to a low poverty neighborhood with
the help of rent subsidies. Ludwig (2012)

details.

478

Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. LVI (June 2018)

provides an useful overview of the MTO
research program, and Kling, Liebman, and
Katz (2007) and Ludwig et. al. (2008, 2012)
summaries of its main findings. In what follows, since my purpose is primarily pedagogical, I abstract from many nuances of the
experiment’s design instead taking a more
synoptic approach.
Let ​
W ∈ ​{0, 1}​​now be an indicator for
whether a household has access to a rent
subsidy. To keep the exposition more p
­ olicy
relevant, and in line with the MTO example, let ​T​now indicate whether a household
falls below (some multiple of) the poverty
line or not. Assume that ​W​is independent
of ​
B​
. This allows for random assignment
of vouchers to households, but with differing assignment probabilities across poor
and ­
non-poor households (including an
assignment probability of zero for ­non-poor
households).
Let ​​Ξ​  S​​  = (E[s​(Z)​| W = 1] − E[s​(Z)​| W = 0])​
be the average difference in neighborhood
poverty across voucher and ­
non-voucher
households. Similarly define
​​Ξ​  B​  _​​​  = ​(E​[​E​[​B|​  Z]​|​  W = 1]​  − E​[​E[​ ​B|​  Z]​|​  W = 0]​)​,
​Ξ​  U​​  = E​[​U|​  W = 1]​  − E​[​U|​  W = 0]​​

as the average difference in neighbors’
backgrounds and neighborhood amenities, respectively, across voucher and
­non-voucher households. All these contrasts
are ­post-assignment, and hence ­post-move
(if applicable). Let ​​p​ W​​  = E​[W]​​ equal the
marginal frequency of voucher receipt.
Consider the linear instrumental variables
fit of ​Y​onto a constant, ​T​and ​s​(Z)​​, using ​W​
as an excluded instrument for ​
s​(Z)​​. Note
that, since W
​ ​is randomly assigned conditional on T
​ ​, this would seem to be a promising and valid application of the method of
instrumental variables. The coefficient on

​s(​ Z)​​in this fit has a probability limit of (see
appendix B)

Although ​
W​is conditionally randomly
assigned given T
​ ​and the underlying outcome model is linear, the instrumental variables fit in this setting does not recover an
interpretable causal parameter. The reason
is that ​T​is not exogenous. Under sorting
and matching, a household’s type will covary
with unobserved neighbors’ attributes ​​m​ A(​​​ Z)​​

U​. Equation
(31) suggests that the application of instrumental variables methods to neighborhood
effects regression analysis may involve some
subtlety.

is not a measure of n
­ eighborhood-level spillovers. Furthermore, as a composite parameter, it may be close to zero even if many of
its components are n
­ onzero due to offsetting
effects.
Whether (32) is an interesting parameter
or not depends upon the question of interest.
It is not a parameter that can be used to predict the effects of (doubly randomized) associational redistributions. The intent to treat
(ITT) effects of voucher receipt reported by
MTO researchers are likely good estimates
of the benefits of a marginal increase in
voucher availability among the population of
MTO participants.
The instrumental variables coefficient on​
s​(Z)​​, (32), varies with the effect of voucher
receipt on the change in (i) neighborhood
fraction poor (​​
Ξ​  S​​​) and (ii) unobserved
neighbors’ background (​​
Ξ​  B​  _​​​​) and unobserved neighborhood amenities (​​Ξ​  U​​​). While
voucher receipt appears to have had rather
durable effects on households’ exposure
to concentrated poverty, other aspects of
neighborhood changed much less for MTO
voucher recipients (cf., Sampson 2012b).
For example, various (measurable) dimensions of school quality appeared to have been
little affected by voucher receipt.
While a rejection of the null that c​​ ​ MTO​​  = 0​
requires that at least one of γ​ 
​​ 0​​​, ​​δ​  0​​,​ or ​​κ​  0​​​ differ from zero and hence that “place matters.”
The interpretation of such a rejection cannot
be equated with the presence of neighborhood spillovers (i.e., γ​ 
​​0​​​ and/or ​​δ​  0​​​ different from zero), since such a rejection may
arise from a pure amenity effect (​​κ​  0​​  ≠ 0​).
Furthermore a failure to reject the null could
easily reflect the operation of various offsetting effects. An M
­ TO-type-induced move
may improve some dimensions of neighborhood quality, while worsening others (cf.,
Durlauf and Ioannides 2010; as an example,
lower poverty neighborhoods with available
rental units could be located in neighborhoods far from employment centers, with

479

less transit options, etc.). Furthermore the
relative importance of these different dimensions may vary with the outcome under
study. Expression (32) may be helpful for
understanding patterns of c­ ross-site heterogeneity found by MTO researchers as well as
the findings of researchers exploiting closely
related designs (e.g., Oreopoulos 2003).
­5.6 Cross-City Research Designs
Several researchers have proposed estimation methods involving aggregation of (16)
to the c­ ity-level as a remedy for sorting bias
(e.g., Evans, Oates, and Schwab 1992; Cutler
and Glaeser 1997; Card and Rothstein 2007;
Ananat 2011). This approach requires observations from a ­cross-section of cities, typically operationalized by a metropolitan
statistical area (MSA), and restrictions on
how the joint distribution of (​​A′, T)​′​ varies
across cities. A formalization and illustration
of this approach is provided here.
The researcher has access to a nationally representative sample of (​​T, Y)​​ pairs.
Assume further that this sample is geocoded,
such that each observation can be assigned
to a specific MSA. As a concrete example,
the NLSY79 and NLSY97 ­
restricted-use
geocode files, available from the Bureau
of Labor Statistics (BLS) by special agreement, may be used to assign each respondent to an MSA of residence (at the time of
adolescence). Index MSAs by c​ = 1, …, N​
and sampled respondents within a city by​
i = 1, …, ​Mc​  ​​​. Assume that various measures
of residential segregation by race, corresponding to the period coinciding with the
respondent’s adolescence, are available for
each city (e.g., computed using information in the Neighborhood Change Database
(NCDB)).22
22
In what follows, I assume that these segregation
measures are known precisely (i.e., not up to some sampling error). If these segregation measures are themselves
estimated, then this fact will need to be incorporated into

480

Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. LVI (June 2018)

We begin by modifying (16) to incorporate
a ­city-specific effect (i.e., intercept):
(33) ​
E[​ ​​Yci​  ​​|​ ​Tci​  ​​  , s​(​Zci​  ​​)​, ​m​ A​​​(​Zci​  ​​)​, ​Uci​  ​​, ​Aci​  ​​]​

The presence of ​​α​  c​​​allows the mean outcome
to vary across cities for reasons unrelated to
segregation.
Let ​​E​​  ∗​​[​Y|​  X; c]​​denote the best linear predictor of Y
​ ​given ​X​conditional on residence
in city ​c​. Let ​var​(​Y|​  c)​ and ​C​(​X, Y|​  c)​​ denote
city-specific variances and covariances.

where ​​η​  2c​  ​​is the eta squared segregation measure for city c​ ​ and ​​p​ c​​  = Pr​
(​T = 1|​  c)​ is the
­city-wide fraction minority. In highly segregated cities (​​η​  2c​  ​  → 1​) own race is very predictive of neighbors’ race. In integrated cities
(​​η​  2c​  ​  → 0​) the ­city-wide fraction minority has
more predictive value.23
Define

to be the ­minority–white gap within city ​c​ in
(i) “background” (​​ϕ​  c​​​), (ii) neighbors’ background (​​υ​  c​​​), and (iii) neighborhood amenities (​​τ​  c​​​) respectively. The first of these terms
is a vector of average differences between
minorities and whites. The latter two terms
are vectors of average differences in features of their neighborhoods. Specifically in
the unobserved attributes of their neighbors
and the unobserved n
­ on-composition-based
characteristics of their neighborhoods. Both
of these are measures of average differences
in neighborhood quality between minorities
and whites. To the extent that these components of neighborhood quality directly influence the outcome of interest (i.e., δ​ ​​0​​  ≠ 0​
), they both are drivers of
and/or ​​κ​  0​​  ≠ 0​
neighborhood effects, broadly defined.
Using (33), (34) and the notation defined
above we get a c­ ity-specific short regression,
deviated from ­city-specific means, of

Here ​​Vc​  ​​​varies with a city’s ­minority–white

interaction of o­wn background with measured segregation. If
​E​[​Vc​  ​​ ​η​  2c​  ​]​  = 0​

(37)

then, by equations (35) and (36), a least
squares fit of the ­city-specific measure of
the ­
minority–white outcome gap, ​
GA​Pc​  ​​​,
onto a constant and ​​η​  2c​  ​​will provide a consistent estimate of ​​γ​  0​​  + ​ϕ​  ′0 ​ ​​  δ​  0​​​. Observe that
this coincides with the coefficient on fraction
minority in the prototypical neighborhoodeffects regression (17) under no sorting and
matching (i.e., when conditions (19) and (20)
hold).
Restriction (37) is sometimes referred
to as a no “differential sorting” across cities assumption (e.g., Card and Rothstein
2007). To understand this language, consider the common case where δ​ ​​ 0​​​ and ​​κ​  0​​​ are
a priori ­presumed equal to zero. In that case
condition (37) requires that, across cities,
variation in the “background gap” is uncorrelated with variation in racial segregation
). Sorting across cit(i.e., ​cov​(​ϕ​  c​​, ​η​  2c​  ​)​  = 0​
ies is allowed, in the sense that differences
in average “background” across cities do
not threaten identification. However the
background gap across cities, if it varies,
­
must do so independently of measured
segregation.
Note that, again in the special case where​​
δ​  0​​  = ​κ​  0​​  = 0​, aggregation does eliminate
biases due to sorting on unobservables.
In that case the coefficient on ​s(​ Z)​​ in the
­within-city neighborhood effects regression
(17) is (see (22) above)

In contrast, the coefficient on η​ ​​2c​  ​​ in the
­cross-city regression of the ­minority–white
outcome gap onto a constant and η​ ​​ 2c​  ​​ is equal
to ​​γ​  0​​​alone. Under these conditions, aggregation does eliminate biases due to sorting,
as is often asserted in empirical work.
However, when ​​δ​  0​​​ and ​​κ​  0​​​ possibly differ
from zero, condition (37) requires maintaining additional (strong) assumptions. First, for​​
δ​  0​​  ≠ 0​, we require zero covariance between
measured racial segregation and ​​(​υ​  c​​  − ​υ​  0​​)​′ ​δ​  0​​​,
the first element of V​ 
​​ c​​​. This implies that
the m
­ inority–white gap in neighbors’ background is uncorrelated with the degree
of ­
metropolitan-area segregation. Very
loosely speaking, this assumption does not
rule out ­
within-city sorting on unobservables, but it does constrain such sorting to
be similar across cities. When δ​ ​​0​​  ≠ 0​ we
also require strengthening the zero covariance condition ​cov​(​ϕ​  c​​, ​η​  2c​  )​ ​  = 0​. For example if ϕ​ 
​​ c​​​ is ­mean-independent of ​​η​  2c​  ​​, then
, the last term in
​​ (​ ​ϕ​  c​​  − ​ϕ​  0)​​ ​′ ​δ​  0​​ ​η​  2c​  ​}​ ​η​  2c​  ​​
{
2
​​Vc​  ​​ ​η​  c​  ​ ,​will be mean zero (along with the
third term). In practice, if the researcher
2
is willing to assume that ​
cov​
(​ϕ​  c​​, ​η​  c​  ​)​  = 0​,
then they ought to be willing to assume that
​E​[​​ϕ​  c​​|​ ​η​  2c​  ]​ ​  = ​ϕ​  0​​​. It is difficult to imagine plausible sorting processes that imply the weaker
(former) condition, but not the stronger (latter) condition.
Second, for κ
​​ ​  0​​  ≠ 0​, we require zero covariance between η​ ​​ 2c​  ​​ and ​​(​τ​  c​​  − ​τ​  0)​​ ​′ ​κ​  0​​​, the second
element of V​ 
​​ c​​​. This implies that the degree
to which race predicts exogenous neighborhood characteristics is uncorrelated with the
level of racial segregation.
In practice, it seems likely that own race
will be a better predictor of unobserved
neighborhood attributes in highly segregated cities, for no other reason than in such
­cities minorities and whites live apart. These

482

c­onsiderations suggest that recovering a
consistent estimate of ​​γ​  0​​​ from the ­cross-city
correlation of G
​ A​P​  c​​​ and ​​η​  2c​  ​​is difficult. At the
same time, one may be able to learn about
the “effects of place” broadly defined from
such an analysis.
To understand this claim, considering maintaining the assumption that
​E​[​​ϕ​  c​​|​ ​η​  2c​  ]​ ​  = 0​(i.e., that the c­ity-specific
minority–white ­
­
background gap is mean
independent of measured segregation). This
is a strong assumption, but one that can be
indirectly assessed (see figure 4 for some
mixed support in the present case). For
example, one could correlate gaps in measured components of family background
with segregation. Under this assumption, the
least squares fit of ​​G​ c​​​onto a constant and ​​η​  2c​  ​​
is consistent for

Here the coefficient on ​​η​  2c​  ​​is not structural.
In particular, it is not consistent for ​​
γ​  0​​​
(or ​​γ​  0​​  + ​ϕ​  ′0 ​ ​​  δ​  0​​​) and hence informative about
the effects of reallocations on outcomes.
The coefficient is, however, a measure of the
effects of “place” on outcomes. It captures
the collective effects of differences in the
racial composition of ones’ neighborhoods,
their average background, and neighborhood
amenities on the m
­ inority–white outcome
gap. Importantly, it is not affected by sorting. I conclude that while a structural interpretation of ­cross-city correlations between

outcome gaps and segregation requires
strong assumptions, a looser interpretation
as a measure of the “effects of place” may be
compelling in some circumstances (similar to
the interpretation of the I­ V–MTO estimand
(32) above). Of course, the p
­ olicy relevance
of this measure, unlike that of the composite parameter ​​γ​  0​​  + ​ϕ​  ′0 ​ ​​  δ​  0​​​, which can be used
to predict the effects of doubly randomized
reallocations, is not immediately clear.
Figure 3 depicts the relationship between
minority (black or Hispanic)–white gaps in
AFQT scores and residential segregation
across forty-four large MSAs (see the notes to
the figure for details on the estimation sample). The ­minority–white gap in test scores is
substantial and significantly larger in highly
segregated cities. Under condition (37) the
variance-weighted least squares (OLS) fit
­
of the estimated AFQT gap onto a constant

tion (37), the fit suggests that a student, if
contrary to fact, was instead raised in a neighborhood with a fraction minority 10 percent
lower, her AFQT score would, in expectation, be about 0.1 standard deviations higher.

24 Since I am weighting, I technically need the mean
independence analog of (37). Unweighted results are not
appreciably different.

Notes: The NLSY97 sample consists of 8,985 youths, of which a total of 7,263 resided in an MSA at baseline
(1,796 Hispanic respondents, 1,943 black respondents, and 3,524 non-Hispanic, non-black respondents). The
estimation sample used here includes the 4,419 respondents who resided in a city with at least five white
responding households as well as five black and/or Hispanic responding households. “AFQT score at age
sixteen” corresponds to the inverse normal CDF transform of the adjusted AFQT percentile score used in
Altonji, Bharadwaj, and Lange (2012). This score was normalized to the distribution of percentile scores
across NLSY79 respondents aged sixteen at the time of test-taking in 1980. Across respondents from the
reference population of American Youth aged fifteen to twenty-three in 1980 this transform of percentile
scores is mean zero with unit variance. Since the Altonji, Bharadwaj, and Lange (2012) percentile scores are
normalized to a different reference group (both in terms of age of testing and year of birth), “AFQT score at
age sixteen” need not be mean zero with unit variance (across all 7,002 respondents with valid AFQT scores its
mean is −0.0001 and its standard deviation is 0.9893). AFQT scores were only available for a subset of the target sample of 7,263 MSA residents. The y-value of each point in the figure corresponds to the coefficient on a
dummy variable for minority (i.e., black or Hispanic) in the least squares fit of standardized AFQT score onto
a constant and minority using observations from a single MSA. The x-value corresponds to the eta-squared
measure of minority segregation in 2000. The size of the scatter points are increasing in the estimated precision of the corresponding minority–white AFQT gap. A total of forty-four MSAs are represented in the figure.

As a pure peer effect, a value of
​​γ​  0​​  + ​ϕ​  ′0 ​ ​​  δ​  0​​​ equal to −1 seems implausibly
large. If we instead interpret the coefficient
on the e­ ta-square measure in terms of regression (38), our view changes. In that case,
the measured relationship is not presumed
to be a pure peer effect. Rather the effect
measures the cumulative impact of a bundle

of ­human-capital producing amenities that
differ, on average, across minority and white
neighborhoods. These could include, among
of things, systematic differences in school
and teacher quality, differences in environmental quality (e.g., indoor air quality,
noise, etc.), differences in exposure to violence and other risks, as well as a pure peer

effect. Each of these items has been shown
to independently influence academic performance. When many drivers of human capital accumulation vary across neighborhoods,
the estimated effect of place can be plausibly
large.
While the interpretation of the pattern
shown in figure 3 is not straightforward,
what is without dispute is that the AFQT
gap varies significantly with measured segregation. Minority adolescents fare worse
relative to their white counterparts, in terms
of AFQT scores, in cities where they live
in separate neighborhoods. Again, whether
this is due to neighborhood effects (i.e.,
​​γ​  0​​  + ​ϕ​  ′0 ​ ​​  δ​  0​​  < 0​), or has some other cause, is
open to debate.
5.7 Additional Identification Challenges
and Opportunities
5.7.1 Policies Other than Associational

the researchers’ interest lies in understanding the likely effects of an associational
redistribution. Associational redistributions
are resource neutral and, as such, leave the

5.7.2 Endogenous Effects and Social
Multipliers
In model (16) all social spillovers, using
the typology of Manski (1993), are of the
exogenous type. The presence of endogenous interactions, whereby the propensity
of an individual to engage in some activity
covaries with the frequency of participation
among her peers, can raise new issues.
One feature of (16) is that all individuals within a group, in our case, a neighborhood, are equally influenced by one another.
Furthermore, there are no cross-group linkages. This simple model can be viewed as
the reduced form of a model also admitting
endogenous effects. This point is developed
carefully in Manski (1993) and Brock and
Durlauf (2001b). If the policies of interest
are associational redistributions, then knowledge of the reduced form will be sufficient.
Once one departs from the benchmark
“­
linear-in-means” model, however, the
endogenous versus exogenous spillovers
distinction has content. One direction of
departure involves maintaining linearity,
but assuming that agents are embedded in
a ­nontrivial network (cf., C
­ alvo-Armengol,
Patacchini, and Zenou 2009; Bramoullé,
Djebbari, and Fortin 2009; Blume et al.
2015). Each individual is connected to only
a finite subset of all other individuals. In
such a setting, the presence of an endogenous effect, implies that an intervention acting upon a ­single individual can have social
multiplier effects that percolate across the
entire network (cf., Graham 2015b). By
picking certain, more “central,” individuals
within a network to intervene upon, indirect spillover effects can be maximized (see
Kim et al. 2015 for an interesting empirical
study related to technology adoption). In
contrast, if only exogenous effects are present, then the effects of interventions stay
local; with spillover effects being confined to
direct friends alone. The n
­ ontrivial network

486

Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. LVI (June 2018)

s­tructure also generates new avenues for
identification (cf., Bramoullé, Djebbari, and
Fortin 2009; Blume et al. 2015).
Another direction of departure involves
introducing nonlinearity, while maintaining
the simple group interaction structure. Brock
and Durlauf (2001a, 2001b) provide an early,
and seminal, analysis of such models. In
nonlinear models, endogenous effects may
result in multiple equilibrium action configurations. Multiple equilibria introduce the
possibility of engineering improvements in
the distribution of outcomes without having
to (i) engage in associational redistribution
or (ii) change the conditional distribution of​
T​given ​A​.
In addition to their potential policy implications, nonlinear models of strategic interaction raise a number of challenging, albeit
also interesting, identification and estimation
issues. De Paula (2013) provides a useful survey of the relevant literature, mostly inspired
by empirical settings common in industrial
organization. Brock and Durlauf (2007)
present some interesting identification
results specific to the neighborhood effects
setting.
My own view is that while it is now possible to point to a modest collection of studies that provide relatively strong evidence
for the existence of social spillovers (e.g.,
Graham 2008; Bayer, Hjalmarsson, and
Pozen 2009), there are few studies that characterize the relative importance of endogenous and exogenous effects. A priori we
might expect endogenous interactions to
be relatively important for explaining some
types of behaviors, such as the initiation of
sexual activity, or drug use, among adolescents (cf., Card and Giuliano 2013). For
other outcomes, such as measured academic
achievement (i.e., grades or test scores), the
a priori case for endogenous effects is, in my
view, weaker.
Given the rather profound policy implications of endogenous interactions, as well as

the interesting identification challenges and
opportunities their presence creates, empirical work in this area would be an interesting undertaking. Boucher et al. (2014) and
Liu, Patacchini, and Zenou (2014) are two
recent, and careful, attempts to study endogenous social effects. Unfortunately, many
existing discussions of endogenous versus
exogenous effects in the empirical literature
are often either n
­ on-credible, confused, or
both.
5.7.3 Nonlinear Exogenous Effects
Even without endogenous effects, nonlinearity raises complex identification,
estimation, and policy issues. Henderson,
Mieszkowski, and Sauvageau (1978) provide
an early example of an empirical study that
takes such nonlinearities seriously (both in
terms of empirical, as well as policy, analysis). Graham, Imbens, and Ridder (2010)
provide a discussion of identification, estimation, and social-planning issues in nonparametric (i.e., nonlinear) models with
exogenous social spillovers. The presentation
of the more basic linear model in this survey,
as well as the development of the no sorting and matching condition, was designed to
make the more general results in Graham,
Imbens, and Ridder (2010) accessible to
readers of this survey. Graham (2011, section
5) provides additional material.
5.7.4 Structural Models of Locational
Sorting
The analysis thus far has viewed sorting
and matching biases as nuisances best dealt
with by an appropriate choice of research
design. An alternative approach utilizes
structural features of a locational sorting
equilibrium to facilitate identification. Of
course, taking a stand on the sorting process
does make inference fragile to violations
of the additional maintained assumptions.
However, explicitly modeling the sorting
process can help to (i) increase efficiency,

Graham: Identifying and Estimating Neighborhood Effects
(ii) generate testable restrictions and
(iii) facilitate the i­mplementation of counterfactual policy analysis. Nesheim (2002)
provides a nice illustration of this approach
(cf., Bayer, Ferreira, and McMillan 2007;
Calabrese et al. 2006). Holmes and Sieg
(2015) survey the literature on structural
estimation of models of locational equilibrium, albeit not with a specific focus
on models with s­pillover-induced sorting
(which do raise special issues). Ioannides
(2011) provides a survey with an explicit
neighborhood-effects focus.
My view is that structural models have an
important role to play in the literature on
neighborhood effects and, further, that there
remains considerable scope for additional
empirical work in this area. In justifying
this view, it is perhaps helpful to step back
and take a bird’s eye view of the identification problem. The key empirical challenge
faced by neighborhood-effects researchers
in economics is to identify the average mapping from own and neighborhood attributes
into outcomes. Call this mapping the production function. The mean regression of
the outcome onto own and neighborhood
attributes, regression (17) above, typically
does not identify the production function
due to sorting and matching. A model of
locational equilibrium allows the researcher
to explicitly characterize sorting and matching bias under maintained assumptions.
Furthermore such models can, again under
certain assumptions, be used to correct for
sorting and matching bias. Conceptually, the
idea is analogous to modeling input demand
in order to identify a firm’s production function (Griliches and Mairesse 1998; Olley and
Pakes 1996). When one further considers
that the process of locational sorting is itself
of intrinsic scientific and policy interest, the
dividends to modeling sorting become even
greater. Altonji and Mansfield (forthcoming)
provide a recent and interesting take on this
line of reasoning.

487

At the same time, I also wish to emphasize that fully nonparametric identification of
the production function is always preferable.
In a fully nonparametric/­nonlinear model,
nonparametric identification requires exogenous variation in neighborhood quality of
the type generated by, for example, (conditionally) double random assignment as
described in Graham (2008); Graham,
Imbens, and Ridder (2010); and Graham
(2011). An ideal empirical approach would
therefore combine experimental estimation
of the production technology with a model
of locational sorting fitted to observational
data. Here the e­ xperimentally identified production function could be used to validate
the sorting model, while the sorting model
could be used to simulate the effects of various c­ ounterfactual policies. This last point
is especially important when we consider
that most realistic policies, by changing the
incentives to sort, only indirectly implement
associational redistributions (cf., Durlauf
2006).
5.7.5 Neighborhood Effects over the Life
Course
Most empirical models of neighborhood
effects are static. An individual’s neighborhood environment during, for example,
childhood is modeled as fixed. In practice,
individuals’ neighborhood contexts generally
evolve throughout childhood, whether due
to the explicit movement of households from
neighborhood to neighborhood, or due to
secular changes in one’s environment due to,
for example, gentrification.
In practice, therefore, it is likely better to
conceptualize individuals’ as experiencing
a sequence of neighborhood environments
during childhood. Furthermore, it seems
sensible to allow for feedback from current
neighborhood quality and (intermediate)
outcomes into future neighborhood quality.
For example, parents who feel as though
their children are poorly served by their

488

Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. LVI (June 2018)

­eighborhood school may seek out new
n
schooling options for their children. In such
a setting, current test scores may be influenced by past neighborhood environment,
while at the same time also drive changes
in future neighborhood environment. A
dynamic perspective also allows researchers
to ask when neighborhood context is most
salient (e.g., early childhood versus adolescence). One can also discriminate between
episodic and persistent exposure to various
types of neighborhood environments.
Relatively few researchers have taken a
dynamic approach to neighborhood-effects
analysis (e.g., Wodtke, Harding, and Elwert
2011; Sharkey and Elwert 2011; Wodtke
2013). This work utilizes methods of covariate adjustment under settings of sequential
exogeneity developed by Jamie Robins in
a series of papers (e.g., Robins 1986, 1997,
1999, and 2000). These methods are neither conceptually, nor in terms of implementation, straightforward. Nevertheless,
they arguably have considerable merit in the
context of observational studies of neighborhood effects. Graham (2015a) provides
a “textbook” introduction to these methods. The scope of their application, given
the increasing availability of large administrative databases with a longitudinal structure is considerable. For example, Chetty,
Hendren, and Katz (2016) observe features
of an individual’s neighborhood environment
through the school-age years, the intermediate outcomes of test scores, as well as the
final outcome of adult earnings.

What Next?

Prior reviewers of the empirical literature
on social spillovers have been remarkably
(and consistently) pessimistic. For example,
Durlauf (2006), an otherwise enthusiastic
proponent of the (potential) role of social
interactions in various social and economic
domains, argues that extant empirical work

“suffers from sufficiently serious problems
of interpretation that it should not strongly
influence one’s prior beliefs…” (p. 163).
Thankfully, the situation has improved
somewhat in the intervening decade. It is
now possible to point to a handful of empirical studies which, at least in my view, are
of sufficiently high quality that one should
use them to update their prior beliefs (e.g.,
Graham 2008; Carrell, Fullerton, and West
2009; Gould, Lavy, and Paserman 2004,
2009, and 2011).
There is also a growing collection of
high-quality studies that report null effects
for many outcomes (e.g., Oreopoulos 2003;
Angrist and Lang 2004; Ludwig et al. 2012).
Many of these are housing mobility studies with strong, highly persuasive research
designs. Some researchers have interpreted
this body of evidence as supportive of the
null that neighborhoods and/or peers are
relatively unimportant for a wide range of
life outcomes (e.g., Angrist 2014, p. 106). I
have not attempted to survey this literature
exhaustively, but my selective reading of it
leads me to a rather different conclusion.
Consider Oreopoulos (2003), who measures the long-run effects of growing up
in “high-density” public housing versus
“low-density” public housing in Toronto.
Oreopoulos (2003) reports that the percent of households below the poverty line
in neighborhoods with high-density public housing was about 18 to 36 percentage
points higher than in neighborhoods with
low-density housing (depending on the
­
definition of neighborhood used; table 2,
row 3). Oreopoulos (2003) then estimates
that male youths growing up in the smaller,
low-density, housing projects had average
­
earnings 5 percent higher than their counterparts in high-density projects, with a
95 percent confidence interval of (roughy)
−5 percent to 15 percent (table 6, row 2,
columns 5 and 6). A 15 percent increase in
earnings, for an 18 to 36 percentage point

Graham: Identifying and Estimating Neighborhood Effects
reduction in childhood exposure to neighborhood poverty, strikes me as a rather large,
perhaps implausibly large “place effect.” Put
differently, Oreopoulos’s (2003) 95 percent
confidence interval more or less spans the
magnitude of effects that I would place positive probability density on a priori. While
the Oreopoulos (2003) study is superbly
designed and executed, its effect on my posterior views of the ­long-run earnings effects
of exposure to impoverished neighborhoods
has been limited.
My read of Angrist and Lang (2004), who
study the effects of classroom exposure to
inner city youth on the academic achievement of suburban youth, is similar. When an
inner city youth enters a suburban classroom,
she affects average measured achievement in
the two ways. The first effect is purely compositional; the second effect arises from any
spillovers onto other students. The ratio of
the ­total-to-compositional effect is the social
multiplier, a unitless summary measure of
spillover strength (e.g., Glaeser, Scheinkman,
and Sacerdote 2003; Graham, Imbens, and
Ridder 2010). Using the coefficient estimates
reported in column 5 of panel A of tables 5
and 6 of Angrist and Lang (2004), I compute
social multiplier point estimates for reading,
mathematics, and language achievement of
1.16, 1.26, and 1.59. While, as Angrist and
Lang (2004) correctly note, many observational studies report even larger effects, these
point estimates are nevertheless meaningfully
large. The tables lack sufficient information
to calculate confidence intervals for these
social multipliers, but the available information suggests they would be quite large.
Oreopoulos (2003) and Angrist and Lang’s
(2004) papers are not the only high-quality
studies to report null findings of neighborhood and/or peer effects, although they are
two of the more widely cited of such studies.
Indeed, they are both excellent studies. They
also present results completely consistent
with sizable neighborhood/peer effects (as

489

well as results consistent with the absence of
such effects). Unless one places substantial
a priori probability on the event that neighborhood effects are extraordinarily large, the
Oreopoulos (2003) and Angrist and Lang
(2004) should cause only a modest update in
your beliefs.
It is important to contextualize these
observations. Several observational peer and
neighborhood-effects studies in the 1990s
reported what were, at least in retrospect,
implausibly large effects (e.g., Crane 1991).
In addition to ­well-understood problems of
unmeasured “confounders” emphasized in
the discussion above, many of these studies
suffered from much deeper methodological problems (e.g., they attempted to fit
what we would now call incomplete models;
cf., Manski 1993; Angrist 2014). The discipline’s reaction to these weaknesses was to
undertake studies with stronger research
designs. Unfortunately many of these studies
have been underpowered; failing to reject
zero effects, but also sometimes quite large
effects. Relatedly, these studies have generally focused on very disadvantaged populations where few interventions of any kind
have been shown to improve outcomes.
Nevertheless the corrective has been useful;
recent evidence suggest, for example, that
the return to less exposure to concentrated
poverty is probably not as high as, for example, earning a college degree.
I have learned a different set of lessons
from the MTO demonstration project. It is
undeniable that many scholars have found the
apparent failure of MTO to find any effects
of improved neighborhood quality on the
economic outcomes of adult movers deeply
disappointing (cf., Rothwell 2015). This finding seems to cast doubt on, for example, the
belief that spatial mismatch is an important
driver of poor minority employment outcomes. However, Ludwig et al. (2012, table
1) report that only about 6 percent of MTO
participants listed employment goals as a
­

490

Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. LVI (June 2018)

primary or secondary reason for wanting to
move at baseline. Perhaps a lack of large
economic effects among the population
targeted by MTO should not have been so
surprising. In contrast, participants did list
violence avoidance, housing quality, and
better schools for children as main motivations for wanting to move. MTO was largely
successful at meeting the first two of these
­self-reported goals.
Chetty, Hendren, and Katz (2016), undertaking the longest term f­ollow-up to date,
with arguably the best data as well, find that
MTO youth who moved early in life experience better labor market outcomes in early
adulthood than their ­
nonmoving counterparts. This finding is consistent with there
being a human capital penalty associated
with sustained exposure to concentrated
poverty. It will be interesting to track this
cohort in the future.
Where does this leave us? Perhaps disappointingly, there remains substantial
scope to conduct studies whose primary
aim is simply to test for the presence, and
measure the magnitude of, neighborhood
effects. There is not yet even a loose disciplinary consensus on the rough importance

of neighborhoods on life outcomes. We are
even further away from answering the deep
question motivating many neighborhoodeffects researchers: what are the social costs
and benefits of residential segregation? It is
possible to motivate associational redistribution policies solely by appeals to equity (i.e.,
by placing intrinsic social value on diverse,
integrated, neighborhoods); however, given
the controversy often associated with such
policies, it is also important to understanding their efficiency implications, as well
(cf., Piketty 2000). The optimal assignment
of individuals to groups in the presence of
social spillovers, in addition to depending on
the form of preferences, typically hinges on
quite subtle features of the mapping from
group composition into outcomes. This
was emphasized in the context of a stylized
model by Benabou (1996) and is an important theme of Graham, Imbens, and Ridder
(2010). Hopefully, the next wave of work on
neighborhood effects will combine the considerable progress that has been made on
understanding the strengths and weakness
of various research designs with a sharper
focus on questions raised by the theory on
sorting and segregation.
