1. INTRODUCTION
A commonconcernof evaluationstudiesis to learnthe distributionof outcomeswhen a
specified treatment policy, or assignment rule, determines the treatment received by each

memberof a specifiedpopulation.Recent studies have emphasizedevaluationof social
programmesprovidingthe sametreatmentto all membersof the population.In particular,
experimentswith randomizedtreatmentshave this objective.The classicalexperimental
protocolcallsfor randomsamplesof the populationto be drawnandformedinto treatment
groups,all of whose membersare assignedthe sametreatment.The empiricaldistribution
of outcomes realizedby a treatmentgroup is then ostensiblythe same (up to random
samplingerror) as would be observedif the treatmentin question were applied to the
entirepopulation.For example,see Manskiand Garfinkel(1992), some of whose chapters
describerecentexperimentalevaluationsof welfareand trainingprogrammes.
Programmesmandatinghomogeneoustreatmentof the populationare of interest,but
so are ones with treatmentvariation.Treatmentvariationoccurswhensocietymandatesa
treatmentbut is unable to compel complianceby persons not wanting to be treated.
Personswishingto avoid a mandatedtreatmentoften find ways to do so. For example,
some childrendo not comply with compulsoryschoolingrequirementsand some adults
do not pay their taxes.
Treatmentvariationoccurswhen resourceconstraintspreventuniversalimplementation of treatmentsthat people do desire.For example,health insurancemay be wanted
by everyonein the UnitedStatesbut thereis presentlyno programmeof universalcoverage.
Treatmentvariation also occurs when programmesexplicitly permit persons to select
among a set of treatments.Physiciansmay offer severaltreatmentoptions to ill patients.
Studentsmay choose among a rangeof educationalalternatives.

Considerthe followinginferentialquestions:
Whatdo observationsof outcomeswhentreatmentsvaryacrossthe populationreveal
about the outcomesthat would occur if treatmentwere homogeneous?
What do observationsof outcomeswhen treatmentis homogeneousrevealabout the
outcomesthat would occur if treatmentwere to vary acrossthe population?
The first question,usuallycalled the selectionproblem,has drawnconsiderableattention
and muchhas beenlearned;see Maddala(1983), Heckmanand Robb (1985), and Manski
(1994). The secondquestion,whichhas remainedunexploredand unnamed,is the subject
of this paper.Formally,the questionasks what inferencesabout mixturesof two random
variablescan be made given knowledgeof their marginaldistributions.Hence I referto
it as the mixing problem.
The mixing problem

To formalizethe inferentialquestion,let each memberof the populationbe describedby
valuesfor [(Yi, Yo),Zm,x]. Here x is a vector of covariates.Thereare two feasibletreatments, labelled 1 and 0. In practicethere are often multiplefeasibletreatments,but this
paper restrictsattentionto the two-treatmentcase assumedin most of the literature.In
the literatureon experimentation,it is common to call one of these the treatment or
intervention, and the other the control.
The letterm denotes the treatmentpolicy of interest.A treatmentpolicy determines
denotesthe treatmentthat
whichtreatmenteach personreceives.The indicatorvariableZmn
a given person receives under policy m; Zm= 1 if the person receives treatment 1 and z,n=
0 otherwise.Associatedwith the treatmentsare outcomes (yi, yo), a pair of elementsof
some outcome space Y. The outcome a person realizesunder policy m is a probability
mixtureof Yi and yo, namely
Ym-YZm +Yo(l ZM).

(1)

The distributionof outcomesrealizedby those personssharingthe same value of x is
P(ymI x) = P(y1 Ix, Zm= l)P(Zm = 11x) + P(yOIx, Zn= O)P(z, =l0j x).

(2)

For example,a welfarerecipientmight be treatedby job-specifictrainingor by basic
education.The relevantoutcomemightbe earnedincomefollowingtreatment.One treatmentpolicymightmandatejob trainingfor all welfarerecipientsand enforcethe mandate.
A second policy might attempt to mandatebasic educationbut not be able to enforce
compliance.A third policy might permita person'scase workerto select the treatment
expectedto yield the largernet benefit,measuredas earnedincomeminustreatmentcosts.
The problemof interestis to learnabout the distributionP(y,,, Ix) of outcomesthat
would be realizedby personswith covariatesx if a specifiedtreatmentpolicy m were in
effect. Inferenceis straightforwardif one can enact policy m and observethe outcomes.

The mixing problemarises when the availabledata are realizationsunder policies

THE MIXING PROBLEM

539

The mixing problem should not be confused with the converse problem: What does
knowledge of P(ym Ix) imply about [P(y1 Ix), P(yo Ix)]? This converse is referred to as
the mixture problem in the statistical literature and as the problem of switching without
sample separation in the econometric literature on switching regressions. The mixing problem should also not be confused with the selection problem (i.e. switching with sample
separation). In this case the question is: What does knowledge of
[P(y, Ix, Z,,e=1), P(yol X, Zm=), P(ZmIx)]
imply about P(y, Ix) and P(yo Ix)?
Organization of the paper
Section 2 uses empirical evidence from a famous social experiment, the Perry Pre-school
Project, to illustrate the mixing problem and the main findings of this paper. Fifteen
years after their participation in this early-childhood educational intervention, 67% of a
treatment group were high school graduates. At the same time, only 49% of a control
group were graduates. Our interest is to determine what the experimental evidence and
various assumptions imply about the rate of high school graduation that would prevail
under treatment policies applying the intervention to some children but not to others.
Sections 3 through 6 present the analysis yielding the empirical results reported in
Section 2. In my earlier study of the selection problem (Manski (1989, 1994)), I found it
productive to begin by determining what can be learned when the sampling process provides the only information available to the researcher. I then examined the identifying
power of various assumptions that might plausibly be invoked in empirical studies. The
present analysis uses the same approach.
Section 3 investigates the mixing problem when knowledge of the two marginal distributions P(y, Ix) and P(yo Ix) is the only information available. The basic finding is Proposition 1, which shows that knowledge of the marginals implies bounds on conditional
probabilities of the form P(ym eB Ix), B c( Y. The bounds are sharp; that is, nothing further
can be learned about P(ymc B Ix) unless other information is available. When outcomes
are real-valued, Proposition 1 implies sharp bounds on the quantiles of P(y,, Ix), presented
here as a Corollary. A more demanding technical challenge, not addressed here, is to
determine the identifiability of the conditional mean E(y,, Ix).
The bounds of Section 3 may be tightened if the researcher possesses suitable prior
information. Prior information restricting the marginal distributions P(y, Ix) and P(yo Ix)
has no identifying power as these distributions are identified by the empirical evidence.'
Prior information restricting the joint outcome distribution P(y, , yo Ix) does have identifying power. So does information about the nature of treatment policy m.
Section 4 examines the identifying power of various assumptions that might, in some
applied contexts, plausibly be, imposed on P(y I, YoIx). In Section 4.1, we assume that y,
and yo are statistically independent conditional on x. In Section 4.2, we assume that the
outcomes are shifted versions of one another, with yI = yo + S for some constant S. In
Section 4.3, we assume that outcomes are ordered, with y, ?yo for all persons with
covariates x.
Section 5 examines restrictions on the treatment policy. In Section 5.1 we assume that
the treatment Zm received by each person is statistically independent of that person's
1. Priorinformationabout P(y, Ix) and P(y( Ix) may improvethe precisionof sampleestimatesof these
quantities,but this usageis distinctfromthe identificationconcernsof the presentpaper.

outcomes (yI , yo), conditional on x. In Section 5.2 we consider two symmetric cases in

which the treatmentthat a person receivesis functionallydependenton his outcomes.
Either ym= max (yl , yo), as in the Roy model of occupational choice, or y = min (y, , y ),
as in the competingrisks model. In Section 5.3, we assume that the size P(zm= 1 Ix) of
the sub-populationreceivingtreatment 1 is known, but the composition of this subpopulationis not known.
Taken one at a time, each of the assumptionsimposedin Section4 and 5 impliesa
distinctivebound on P(ymIx). None of the assumptions,however,is strong enough to
identifyP(ymIx). In Section6, we show that combiningcertainpairsof assumptionsdoes
sufficeto identifyP(ymIx).
Taken as a whole, this paperprovidesa menu of options for addressingthe mixing
problem.The paperdoes not advocatethe adoptionof any "best"option. The appealof
the various options necessarilyvaries with the applicationof interestand, in particular,
with the assumptionsthat one is willingto entertainas plausiblein that application.

Identification and sample inference

The mixingproblem,like the selectionproblem,is a failureof identificationratherthan
a difficultyin sample inference.To keep attention focused on identification,Sections 3
through6 maintainthe assumptionthat the marginaldistributionsP(y1 Ix) and P(yo Ix)
are knownalmost everywhereon the covariatespace.The identificationfindingsreported
in these sectionscan be translatedinto consistentsampleestimatesof identifiedquantities
by replacingP(y, Ix) and P(yo Ix) with consistentnon-parametricestimates,as is done
in Section2. Moreover,samplingconfidenceintervalscan be placedaroundtheseestimates,
much as they were by Manski et al. (1992) in an empiricalstudy concernedwith the
selectionproblem.
For the sake of simplicity,I shallhenceforthnot explicitlyconditionon the covariates
x. Thus, P(y, Ix) and P(yo Ix) will be denotedP(y, ) and P(yo) from now on. The reader
should keep in mind that the analysisof this paperholds for any specificationof x.

Caveats on classical experimentation

Where it discusses experimentationwith randomizedtreatments,this paper maintains
the classicalassumptionthat experimentalregimesoperateexactly as would mandatory
treatmentpolicies.I have elsewherediscussedsome of the many reasonswhy this central
tenet of experimentalanalysis may fail to hold when applied to welfare and training
programmes(see the introductionto Manskiand Garfinkel(1992)). Some subjectsmay
not comply with their randomlyassigned treatments.Macro feedback effects such as
marketequilibrationmay makethe full-scaleimplementationof a socialprogrammeinherentlydifferentfromthe small-scaleimplementationof an experiment.Strictureson forcing
human subjectsinto experimentsmay make it impossible to form random treatment
groups.
The presentanalysisassumesaway all of these very real concernsin order to focus
cleanlyon the mixingproblem.In practice,researchersundoubtedlyoften haveto confront
the mixingproblemin combinationwith other problemsin the analysisof experimental
data.

2. AN ILLUSTRATION:THE PERRY PRE-SCHOOLPROJECT
Beginningin 1962,the PerryPre-schoolProjectprovidedintensiveeducationaland social
servicesto a randomsampleof blackchildrenin Ypsilanti,Michigan.Theprojectinvestigators also drew a second random sample of such children,but providedthem with no
specialservices.Subsequently,a varietyof outcomeswere ascertainedfor most members
of the treatmentand control groups. Among other things, it was found that 67%of the
treatmentgroupand 49%of the controlgroupwerehigh-schoolgraduatesby age 19 (see
Berrueta-Clement et al. (1984)).2 This and similar findings for other outcomes have been

widelycited as evidencethat intensiveearlychildhoodeducationalinterventionsimprove
the outcomesof childrenat risk (see Holden (1990)).
For purposes of this illustration,let us accept the Perry Pre-school Project as a
classicalexperimentwith randomizedtreatments.Let treatment1 be the educationaland
social servicesprovidedto childrenparticipatingin the project and let treatment0 be
whateverservicesas were availableto childrenin the control group. Let y be a binary
variableindicatinghigh-schoolgraduationby age 19.
Ignoring attrition and samplingerror, the experimentaldata reveal that the high
school graduationprobabilitywould be 0 67 if all black childrenin Ypsilanti were to
receivethe servicesprovidedby the PerryPre-schoolProjectand would be 0-49 if none
of them were to receive these services.Thus P(y, = 1) =0 67 and P(yo= 1)=0 49. The
questionis this: What do the experimentaldata revealabout the probabilityP(y,, = 1) of
high school graduationundera treatmentpolicy in whichsome childrenreceivethe Perry
Pre-schoolservicesand the rest do not?
Table 1 summarizesthe inferencesthat can be made given the experimentalevidence
and varyingassumptionsabout the outcomedistributionand the treatmentpolicy.In each
case, the table cites a propositionor equationimplyingthe estimateshown. These results
will be developedformallyin Sections3 through6 and are discussedinformallybelow.
2.1. Inference using only the experimental evidence

It mightbe conjecturedthat, if some childrenwereto receivethe PerryPre-schoolservices
and the restnot, the high-schoolgraduationprobabilitywould lie betweenthose observed

the investigators obtained graduation data.

that P(ymn
To understandthis result, observethat each memberof the populationhas one of
these four valuesfor (yi, yo):
(yi =O, yo=0), (Yi = 1, yo= 1), (Y' = 1, yo=0), (yi =Q, yo

1).

Treatmentpolicy has no impact on membersof the first two groups but determinesthe
outcomesof membersof the lattertwo groups.The highestachievablegraduationrate is
obtainedby a treatmentpolicy that assignseach memberof the thirdgroupto treatment
I and each memberof the fourth group to treatment0. Then the graduationrate is
1- P(y, = 0, yo= 0). Symmetrically,the lowest achievablegraduationrate is obtainedby
a treatmentpolicy that assignseach memberof the third group to treatment0 and each
memberof the fourthgroupto treatment1. Then the graduationrate is P(yI = 1, yo= 1).
The Perry Pre-school experimentcannot reveal the joint probabilitiesP(y =0,
yo= 0) and P(yI = 1, yo= 1). By definition,treatments0 and I are mutuallyexclusive.So
we never observe both yo and yi for the same subject.The experimentdoes reveal the
marginal probabilities P(yI = 1) = 0 67 and P(yo = 1) = 0 49. Among all joint distributions
P(yl, yo) that are consistent with these marginals,there is one that minimizesboth
P(yi = 0, yo=0) and P(y1 = 1, yo= 1). This is
P(y,

0,yo=0) =0

P(y, = 1, yo=0)=0

51

P(yi =0, yo= 1) =0 33
P(yi = 1, yo= 1)=0 16.

Hence, the highestgraduationrate consistentwith the experimentalevidenceis 1 and the
lowest is 0 16.

2.2. Inference using other information

The interval[0*16, 1] is a "worst-case"bound on P(y,, = 1). A researcherwho is willing
to impose assumptionson the joint distributionP(yl, yo) or on the form of treatment
policy m may be able to tightenthis bound.

Restrictions on the outcome distribution

Supposefirst that one has no informationabout treatmentpolicy m but has information
about P(y I, yo) that, when combined with the known marginals, reveals P(yI = 0, Yo= 0)
and P(y1=1, yo=1). Then one can tighten the bound on P(y,..=l) from [0-16, 1] to
l-P(y1=0,yo=0)].
[P(yi=l,yo=l),

In particular,one might think that receivingthe pre-schoolinterventioncan never
harma child'shigh-schoolgraduationprospects;that is, outcomesare orderedwithy1=
O0=Yo=0.This assumptionimpliesthat
P(y1 = 1, yo = 1) = P(yo

1) = 0.49

P(y, =0, yo=0) = P(y1 =0) =033.
Hence, P(ym= 1) must lie in the interval [0 49, 0 67].

A moreneutralassumptionmightbe that yi andyo are statisticallyindependent.This
assumptionimpliesthat

P(yi 0=,yo=0)=P(y

=

l)P(yo= 1)=0 33

=0)P(yo0)

=0 17.

Hence, P(ym= 1) must lie in the interval[0-33, 0-83].

Restrictions on the treatmentpolicy

Now supposethat one has no informationabout the outcomedistributionbut does have
informationabout the treatmentpolicy.
Perhaps one optimisticallybelieves that treatmentdecisions would be made by
omniscientparentswho choose for each child the treatmentyieldingthe betteroutcome.
Then, as shown above, the graduationrate would be 1- P(yI = 0, yo=0). We already
know that zero is the smallestvalue of P(y, = 0, yo= 0) that is consistentwith the known
marginals. The largest feasible value of P(y, = 0, yo = 0) is min [P(y1 = 0), P(yo = 0)]=
0 33. Hence, P(ym= 1) must lie in the interval[0 67, 1].
Or perhapsone believesthat treatmentassignmentswouldbe statisticallyindependent
of outcomes,as they would if an explicitrandomassignmentrulewereused. In this case,
it is obvious that the graduationrate must lie betweenthe 0 49 and 0-67 observedin the
control and treatmentgroups.
Finally,imaginethat resourceconstraintslimit implementationof the interventionto
part of the population.Supposeone knows the fractionof the populationreceivingthe
intervention,but does not know the compositionof the treatedand untreatedsubpopulations. As Table 1 shows, knowingthat 1/10 or 5/10 or 9/10 of the populationreceives
the interventionimpliesthat the graduationrate must lie in the interval[0 39, 0 59] or
[0-17, 0 99] or [0-57, 0 77] respectively.These resultswill be provedin Section 5.3.3

Identification of the graduation rate

The scenariosconsideredthus far bring to bear assumptionsthat tighten the worst-case
bound on the high-schoolgraduationratebut do not identifyit. The high-schoolgraduation rate may be identifiedif strongerassumptionsare imposed.
Supposeone knows that the outcomes(y' , yo) are statisticallyindependentand that
each child receivesthe treatmentyieldingthe betteroutcome.Then one can concludethat
P(Ym= 1)= 1 -P(y1 =0, yo=0)=

I -P(y1 =0)P(yo=0)=0-83.

Alternatively,supposeone knows that undertreatmentpolicy m, 5/10 of the population
would receivetreatment1 and treatmentassignmentswould be statisticallyindependent
of outcomes.Then the impliedgraduationrate is 0 58, midwaybetweenthe control and
treatmentgroupgraduationrates.
3. Observethat the firstand thirdintervalsare relativelynarrowbut the secondis ratherwide,almostas
wide as the bound in the absenceof priorinformation.This patternof resultsreflectsthe fact that the power
of treatmentpolicyto determinewho receiveswhichtreatmentis muchmoreconstrainedwhenP(-,,, I) is fixed
at a value near zero or one than it is when P(z... = 1) is fixed at 5/10.

REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES

544
Summary

Considered by itself, the experimental evidence from the Perry Pre-school Project permits
only weak conclusions to be drawn about the probability of high-school graduation under
a treatment policy in which some children receive the Perry Pre-school services and the
rest do not. The experimental evidence combined with prior information implies stronger
conclusions. The nature of these stronger conclusions depends critically on the assumptions
imposed.
This lesson is analogous to that learned over the past twenty years about inference
on mandatory programmes from observations of outcomes when treatments vary. Mixing
and selection are distinct identification problems, but they raise similar issues in evaluation
studies.

3. IDENTIFICATION OF MIXTURES USING ONLY KNOWLEDGE
OF THE MARGINALS
The remainder of this paper analyses the mixing problem more formally. Abstracting from
our substantive concern with programme evaluation, we ask what restrictions on the
mixture distribution P(ym) are implied by knowledge of the marginals P(y,) and P(yo).
We begin with the worst-case situation in which no other information is available.

3.1. Sharp bounds on probabilities of events
The basic finding concerns the probability P(ym eB) that Ymfalls in any specified set B.
Given that Y,nalways equals either yo or y,, it might be thought that P(ym eB) must lie
between P(yoeB) and P(y1eB). This is not so. Proposition 1 gives the sharp bound on
P(ymeB).

Proposition 1. Let P(yI) and P(yo) be known. Let C_P(yieB)+P(yoeB).
max (0, C-1) < P(ymeB) < min (C, 1).

Then
(3)

Proof. The largest.possible value of P(ymeB) is P(y, eB uyoeB). This is achieved
by a treatment policy that always chooses a treatment whose outcome lies in B, when
such a treatment exists. The smallest possible value of P(y,t-B) is P(y eB r yoe B). This
is achieved by a treatment policy that always chooses a treatment whose outcome lies in
the complement of B, when such a treatment exists. Thus P(y,tcB) must lie in the interval
P(y1 eB ri yoB) <P(ymeB) <P(yI eB u yoeB).

(4)

If P(y1, yo) were known, (4) would be the sharp bound on P(y,,,e B). We are concerned, however, with the situation in which only P(y1) and P(yo) are known. In this
situation, the sharp lower bound on P(ym eB) is the smallest value of P(y1e Br-yoe B)
that is consistent with the known P(y1) and P(yo). The sharp upper bound is the largest
feasible value of P(y 1eB u yoeB).

THE MIXING PROBLEM

Frechet (1951) proved this sharp bound on P(yIeBryoeB),

545
given knowledgeof

and P(yo):4

P(yi)

max (0, C- l)<P(yjeBrnyoEB)

<min [P(yIeB), P(yoeB)].

(5)

Hence, max (0, C-1) is the sharplower bound on P(ym,EB).
To obtain the sharpupperbound on P(ymEB),observethat
P(y1 eB U yOEB) = C-P(y1 eB r yoeB).

(6)

Applyingthe Frechetbound on P(y1eB n yoeB) shows that
max [P(yieB), P(yoeB)]<P(yIeBuyoeB)<min

(C, 1).

II

(7)

Observethat the bound on P(ymeB) is informativefrom the left or the rightbut not
fromboth sidessimultaneously.The widthof the boundnarrowstoward0 as C approaches
0 or 2 but widens toward 1 as C approaches1. Thus, knowledgeof the marginalsmay
reveala lot or a little about the magnitudeof P(ymeB), dependingon the empiricalvalue
of C. In the PerryPre-schoolillustration,B= { 1}, P(yoeB) = 0 49, P(y IeB) = 0 67, and
C=1*16.
3.2. Sharp bounds on quantiles

Supposethat outcomesare real-valued.Let ueR' and B= (-oo, u]. By Proposition1,
max [0, P(yI < u) + P(yo < u) -1 ] < P(ym < u)
<min [P(yI < u) + P(yo _ u), 1].

(8)

Let a e (0, 1) and let qm(a) denote the a-quantileof Yin.Corollary1.1 invertsthe bound
(8) to obtain a sharp bound on qn2(a).
Corollary 1.1. Let P(yi ) and P(yo) be known. Let Y be the real line. Let
r1(a) =infu s.t. P(y <?u)+ P(yo<u) ? a
si (a) =_infus.t. P(yj < u) + P(yo < u) - I ? a.
Then
r I(a)

_ q,,(a)

_ s I(a).

(9)

Proof By the upperbound on P(ym< u) in (8),
u<r1(a)=>P(y

<?u)+P(yo<u) < a

=tP(ym _ u) < a
==q.(a)

> u.

4. See Ord(1972)for an expositionof the Frechetboundand Ruschendorf(1981) for a thoroughanalysis.
It is elementaryto show that P(yj eBr yoeB) must lie withinthe bound.The upperbound holds becausethe
event (y IeBryoeB) implieseach of its componentevents(y, eB) and (y(e B). The lowerboundholdsbecause
P(yj eB uyoeB)=

C-P(yieB

ry(eB) < 1.

The more subtle aspect of the Frechetbound is that it is sharp.That is, thereexists a distributionP(y , y,)
with marginalsP(y1) and P(y0) for which P(y1 eBrny(eB) equals the lower bound in (5), and there exists
anotherdistributionwith these marginalsfor whichP(y1e Br) y(0eB) equalsthe upperbound in (5).

Hence ri (a) < qj(a). By the lower bound on P(ym_ u) in (8),
u?s1(a)=.P(y,

?u) +IP(yo<u) -1 > a

=>P(ym?uu) > a
=>qm(a) < u.

Hence qm(a)<s1ta).

These bounds on qn,(a) are sharp because the bounds in (8) are

sharp. 11
It is interestingthat the bounds on quantilesof P(yrn) are informativeboth above
and below. This is so even though the bound on P(ym<u) used to deriveCorollary1.1
is only informativeabove or below, the informativedirectiondependingon the value
of u.
4. RESTRICTIONSON THE OUTCOME DISTRIBUTION
The proof to Proposition 1 showed that if P(yjeBriyoeB) and P(yjeBuyoeB) are
known but the treatmentpolicy is not known, inequality(4) providesthe sharp bound
on P(yme5B). Threecases are presentedhere.
4.1. Independentoutcomes

Supposeit is known that the outcomesy, and yo are statisticallyindependent.Then
P(yi eB r-yoeB)

(10)

=P(y1 eB)P(yoeB).

Our second propositionfollows immediately:
Proposition 2. Let P(yl) and P(yo) be known. Let it be known that y' and yo are
statistically independent.Then
P(yi eB)P(yoeB)?P(ymeB)

< C-P(yi eB)P(yo-B).

(11)

Observethat, whereasthe bound obtainedin Proposition1 was informativeonly in one
direction,the presentbound is generallyinformativeboth above and below.
Supposethat outcomesare real-valued.By Proposition2,
P(yI < U)P(yO < U) ? P(ym _ U)

< P(yl < U) + P(yo <u)-P(yI

_u)P(yO <u),

(12)

for all ueR'. Corollary2.1 inverts(12) to obtain sharp bounds on quantilesof P(y,,,).
The proofusesthe sameargumentas was appliedto proveCorollary1.1,and so is omitted.
Corollary 2.1. Let P(y1) and P(yo) be known. Let it be known that y, and yo are
statistically independent.Let Y be the real line. Let

Then
r2(a) _qj(a) <S2(a).

(13)

4.2. Shifted outcomes
Evaluation studies often assume that Yi and yo are not only statistically dependent but
functionally dependent. It is especially common to assume that real-valued outcomes are
shifted versions of one another; that is,5
Yli=Yo6+

(14)

for some constant 6. Shifted outcomes is widely thought of as a relatively innocuous
assumption, but recent analyses of the selection problem make clear that it is a quite
restrictive condition with strong identifying power. See Heckman and Robb (1985),
Bjorklund and Moffitt (1987), Robinson (1989), and Manski (1994).
Suppose that (14) holds. Knowledge of P(y1) and P(yo) implies knowledge of 6. So
P(y1, yo) is known and the bound (4) is computable. Thus we have
Proposition 3. Let P(y, ) and P(yo) be known. Let Y be the real line. Let it be known
that YI= yo + 6, for some 6 E R'. Then 6 is identifiedand
P[(yo + 6) eB n yoeB] _ P(y,eB)
<P[(yo+6)

eB]+P(yocB)-P[(yo+6)

eBr-)yoeB].

(15)

When B= (-oo, u], this bound takes a simple form. Assume, without loss of generality, that 6?0. Then (15) becomes
P(yI < u) < P(Y" _ u)? P(yo

u).

(16)

Corollary 3.1 inverts (16) to obtain sharp bounds on quantiles of P(y,,,).
Corollary 3.1. Let P(y1 ) and P(yo) be known. Let Y be the real line. Let it be known
that yI = yo + 6, for some 6 > 0. Let
r3(a)

infus.t. P(yo ? u) > a

s3(a)

infus.t. P(y < u) > a.

Then
r3(a) _q,(a)

s3(a).

(17)

4.3. Orderedoutcomes
Outcomes Yi and yo are said to be ordered with respect to a given set B if 6
yi eB=-y0eB.

(18)

5. Knowledge of P(y,) and P(yo) makes the shifted-outcome assumption a testable hypothesis. If (14)
holds, then P(y1) and P(yo) must be the same up to a translation of location. In contrast, the statistical
independence assumption of Section 4.1 is not testable, as it implies no restrictions on P(y, ) and P(v,(,).
6. Knowledge of P(yy) and P(yo) makes the ordered-outcomes assumption a testable hypothesis. If ( 18)
holds, then P(y(eB) > P(y, eB).

REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES

For example, let the outcomes be binary and suppose that YI= 0=>yo=0. Then the outcomes are ordered with respect to the set B= {O}. This assumption was discussed earlier
in the context of the Perry Pre-school illustration. One may believe that receiving the
intervention cannot diminish a child's prospects for graduation. Then any child who
receives the intervention and does not graduate would not graduate in the absence of the
intervention.
As another example, suppose that the outcomes are real-valued and that
Yi_Yo-

(19)

Then y and yo are ordered with respect to all sets of the form B= (-oo, u], because
Yi <?u=yOu.
If Yi and yo are ordered with respect to B, then
P(y, eB nryoeB) = P(y eB),

(20)

so the bound (4) is computable. Thus we have
Proposition 4.
Then

Let P(yl) and P(yo) be known. Let it be known that yi eB=:y0eB.
P(yi eB) <P(ymeB) <P(yoeB).

(21)

An interesting result emerges when (21) is applied to real-valued outcomes satisfying
(19). Letting B = (- oo, u], we find that (21) coincides with the bound (16) that holds when
outcomes are known to be shifted. Thus it turns out that, in the context of the mixing
problem, assumptions (14) and (19) have the same power to identify P(ym <u). Manski
(1994) showed that these assumptions have different implications in the context of the
selection problem.
5. RESTRICTIONS ON THE TREATMENT POLICY
This section examines the restrictions on P(ym) implied by prior information about the
treatment policy, in the absence of information about the outcome distribution. In Section
5.1 we assume that treatment is statistically independent of outcomes, as in randomized
experiments. In Section 5.2 we assume that treatment is functionally dependent on outcomes. Section 5.3 examines the problem of inference when the fraction of the population
receiving each treatment is known, but nothing is known about the composition of the
sub-populations receiving each treatment.
5.1. Treatment independentof outcomes
Suppose it is known that the treatment Zmreceived by each person is statistically independent of the person's outcomes (Yl, yo). That is,
P(yI, YoIZ.) = P(yI,yo).

(22)

Then
P(Ym) = P(y, )P(zni=1) + P(yO)P(za,= 0).

(23)

In the absence of other information, the only restriction on the treatment distribution is
that P(z, = 1) and P(z, = 0) must lie in the unit interval and add up to one. Hence
Proposition 5 follows immediately:

THE MIXING PROBLEM

549

Proposition 5. Let P(y1 ) and P(yo) be known. Let it be known that zrn is statistically
independentof (yi, yo). Then
min [P(y, eB), P(yoeB)] ?P(ymEB) <max [P(yi eB), P(yoeB)].

(24)

The bound of Proposition 5 is contained within each of the bounds reportedin
Propositions2 through 4, where we left the treatmentpolicy unspecifiedand imposed
restrictionson the outcomedistribution.This fact has a simpleexplanation.Equation(23)
shows that, if

Zm is

statistically independent of (y I, Yo), then P(ym) depends on P(y I, yo)

only throughthe marginaldistributionsP(y1) and P(yo). Hence,if one knows that zmis
independent of (y', yo), then restrictions on P(y1, yo) have no identifying power.

Let outcomesbe real-valuedand let B= (- oo, u]. Invertingthe bound in Proposition
5 producesthe followingbound on quantilesof P(ym):
Corollary 5.1. Let P(y, ) and P(yo) be known. Let it be known that zmis statistically
independentof (Yi, yo). Let Y be the real line. Let
r5(a) inf; s.t. max [P(y1 ?u), P(yo 4u)]>a,
s5(a)-inf

s.t. min [P(yI <u), P(yo?u)] ? a.

Then
r5(a) ?qm(a) ?s5(a).

(25)

5.2. Optimizationpolicies

To prove Proposition 1, we examinedtwo extremetreatmentpolicies, one minimizing
P(ymcB) and the other maximizingit. Suppose that one of these policies is actually
implemented.What can be learnedabout P(ymEB) in the absenceof prior information
about the outcomedistribution?
The policy minimizing P(yrneB) makes P(ym eB) = P(y1 eB n yoeB). The one maximizing P(ymEB) makes P(ymeB) = P(y1 eB uyoeB). Applying the Frechet bounds (5) and

(7) yields Proposition6:
Proposition 6. Let P(yi ) and P(yo) be known.
(a) Let it be known that P(ymeB) = P(yI eB n yoeB). Then
max (0, C- 1) P(ymeB)

min [P(yi eB), P(yoeIB)].

(26)

(b) Let it be known that P(ymeB) =P(yI eB u yoeB). Then
max [P(y1 eB), P(yo0B)] _ P(ym,eB) < min (C, 1).

(27)

It is interestingto comparetheseboundswith those underotherassumptions.In Part
(a), the lower bound coincideswith the lower bound in the absenceof prior information
(see Proposition 1), while the upper bound coincides with the lower bound under the
assumptionthat treatmentis independentof the outcomes (see Proposition5). In Part
(b), the lowerboundcoincideswith the upperboundunderthe assumptionthat treatment
is independentof the outcomes(see Proposition5), while the upperbound coincideswith
the upperbound in the absenceof prior information(see Proposition1). Thus the three
treatmentpoliciesexaminedin Propositions5 and 6 implythat P(y,,,eB) lies in mutually

exclusiveintervals,and these three intervalspartitionthe range of values that is feasible
in the absenceof priorinformation.
Selection of the treatment with the larger or smaller outcome

Proposition6 has importantapplicationsin economicsand in survivalanalysis.Economic
analysesof voluntarytreatmentpolicies often assumethat outcomesare real-valuedand
that the treatmentyieldingthe largeroutcomeis selected,so
yM=max(yj,y0).

(28)

In the labour-economicsliteratureon occupationchoice,this is oftencalledthe Roy model
(see Heckman and Honore (1990)). For any ueRl, a treatmentpolicy satisfying (28)
makes P(ym ? u) = P(y1 < u n yo ! u). So Proposition 6(a) shows that
max [0, P(y1 ?u) + P(yo < u) -1] _ P(ym < u)
<min [P(yI < u), P(yo < u)].

(29)

The competingrisksmodel of survivalanalysis(see Kalbfleischand Prentice(1980))
assumesthat outcomesare real-valuedand that the treatmentyieldingthe smalleroutcome
is selected,so
(30)

ym=min(Yi,yo).

ThistreatmentpolicymakesP(ym? u) = P(y1 ? u u yo< u). So Proposition6(b) showsthat
max[P(yi<u),P(yo?u)]?P(ym_u)<min

[P(yi<u)+P(yo<u),

(31)

P(ym).

5.3. Known treatment distribution

The restrictionson treatmentpolicyexaminedin Sections5.1 and 5.2 specifythe ruleused
to maketreatmentassignments,but do not a prioriconstrainthe fractionof the population
receivingeach treatment.It is also of interestto considerthe reversesituation,whereone
knows the fraction receivingeach treatmentbut does not know the rule used to make
treatmentassignments.For example,we noted earlierthat resourceconstraintscould limit
implementationof the PerryPre-schoolinterventionto part of the eligible population.
would sufficeto deterKnowledgeof the budgetconstraintand the cost of pre-schoMling
mine the fractionof the populationreceivingthe treatment.It may be more difficultto
learnhow school officials,socialworkers,and parentsinteractto determinewhichchildren

Thus assume that, under policy m, a known fractionp of the population receive
treatmentyo and the remainingfraction 1-p receivetreatmentyi. So
P(Zm= 0) =P,

(34)

where p is known. No informationis available on the rule used to make treatment
assignmentsthat satisfy (34).
Given (34), P(ym) may be written
P(ym)

The marginaldistributionsP(y1) and P(yo) may be written
P(Yi )=P(yil

Zm=1)(1 P) + P(Yl Zm=O)P

(36a)

and
P(yo)=P(yoI Zm=1)( -p) +P(yoj Zm=O)P.

(36b)

Knowledge of P(y1 ) and p restricts P(y1I Zm= 1) and P(y I Zm= 0) to pairs of distributions
that satisfy (36a); similarly, knowledge of P(yo) and p restricts P(yo Izm= 1) and

P(yo zm=0) to pairs of distributionsthat satisfy (36b).
Let W denotes the set of all distributionson Y. Examinationof (36) shows that
P(y1 IZm=1) and P(yo Zm= 0) lie in the following sets of distributions:
P(yj I zm=l)e-TII (p)_=T r [{P(yj)-pV1}/(1

-p): VceW]

(37a)

and
P(yolzm=O)?Woo(p)=-Tnr[{P(yo)-(1-p)i}/p:

yV'P].

(37b)

It follows that P(ym) is a (1 -p, p) mixtureof a distributionin TP1(p) and one in TPoo(p).
That is,
P(ym)e[(l -p)VII +p'oo: (yVii, V,oo) TP11

itz and Manski(1995) have analysedthe sets TP11(p) and T00(p) in a recentstudy of the

here. Their Corollary 1.2 proves the following sharp bounds on P(y1 eBI z,,= 1) and
P(yoeB l Zm= 0):7

more work to show that these bounds are sharp.

Evidence on one treatment

Throughoutthis paper, I have assumed that empiricalevidence is available for both
treatments.Suppose now that such evidence is available for only one treatment,say
treatment1; so P(yi) is known and P(yo) is unrestricted.In the absenceof information
on the fractionof the populationreceivingeach treatment,nothingcan be learnedabout
P(Ym). After all, P(zm= 0) =1 might hold, in which case P(ym) = P(yo). On the other
hand, some inference on P(ym) is possible if P(zm) is known. Proposition 8 and Corollary

8.1 providethe results.
Proposition 8.

Let P(yj ) be known. Let P(z,, = 0) =p, for known p. Then

6. IDENTIFYING COMBINATIONSOF ASSUMPTIONS
Takenone at a time, the assumptionsexaminedin Sections4 and 5 tightenthe worst-case
bound of Section 3, but are not strongenough to identifyP(y,,). Variouscombinations
of these assumptionsdo identifyP(ym). Here are two examples.
Supposeone knows that treatmentis independentof outcomesand one also knows
the fractionp of the populationwho receivetreatment0. These two assumptionsimply
that
P(ym) =P(y I)(I -p) +P(yo)p.

(44)

So P(ym) is identified.

Alternatively,supposeone knows that y' and yo are statisticallyindependentof one
another and one also knows that ym=max (y, , yo). Then
P(ym?u) =P(y ?u r yo<u) =P(y? <u)P(yo<u).

(45)

So P(ym ? u) is identified for all values of u. Hence P(y,,) is identified.
