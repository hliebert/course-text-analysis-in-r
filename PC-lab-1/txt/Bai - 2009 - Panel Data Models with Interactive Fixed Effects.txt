PANEL DATA MODELS WITH INTERACTIVE FIXED EFFECTS

By Jushan Bai1
This paper considers large N and large T panel data models with unobservable multiple interactive effects, which are correlated with the regressors. In earnings studies,
for example, workers' motivation, persistence, and diligence combined to influence the
earnings in addition to the usual argument of innate ability. In macroeconomics, interactive effects represent unobservable common shocks and their heterogeneous impacts
on cross sections. We consider identification, consistency, and the limiting distribution
of the interactive-effects estimator. Under both large N and large T, the estimator is
shown to be \fNT consistent, which is valid in the presence of correlations and heteroskedasticities of unknown form in both dimensions. We also derive the constrained

estimator and its limiting distribution, imposing additivity coupled with interactive effects. The problem of testing additive versus interactive effects is also studied. In addition, we consider identification and estimation of models in the presence of a grand
mean, time-invariant regressors, and common regressors. Given identification, the rate
of convergence and limiting results continue to hold.

Keywords: Additive effects, interactive effects, factor error structure, bias-corrected estimator, Hausman tests, time-invariant regressors, common regressors.

Because additive effects are special cases of interactive effects, the interactive-effects estimator is consistent when the effects are, in fact, additive, but
the estimator is less efficient than the one with additivity imposed. In this paper, we derive the constrained estimator together with its limiting distribution
when additive and interactive effects are jointly present. We also consider the
problem of testing additive effects versus interactive effects.

In Section 2, we explain why incorporating interactive effects can be a useful
modelling paradigm. Section 3 outlines the estimation method and Section 4
discusses the underlying assumptions that lead to consistent estimator. Section 5 derives the asymptotic representation and the asymptotic distribution of
the estimator. Section 6 provides an interpretation of the estimator as a generalized within-group estimator. Section 7 derives the bias-corrected estimators.
Section 8 considers estimators with additivity restrictions and their limiting distributions. Section 9 studies Hausman tests for additive effects versus interac-

tive effects. Section 10 is devoted to time-invariant regressors and regressors

that are common to each cross-sectional unit. Monte Carlo simulations are

given in Section 11. All proofs are provided either in the Appendix or in the

Supplemental Material (Bai (2009)).

Feldstein-Horioka (1980) puzzle, one of the six puzzles in intern
economics (Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000)). The puzzle refers to t
high correlation between domestic savings and domestic inves

economies. In their model, Yit is the investment and Xit is the sav

try i, Ft is the common shock that affects both investment an
sions. Giannone and Lenza found that the high correlation is
of the strong assumption that shocks have homogeneous effec
tries (additive effects); it disappears when shocks are allowed
geneous impacts (interactive effects).
Microeconometrics

In earnings studies, Yit represents the wage rate for individual i with age (or
age cohort) t and Xit is a vector of observable characteristics, such as education, experience, gender, and race. Here A,- represents a vector of unobservable
characteristics or unmeasured skills, such as innate ability, perseverance, motivation, and industriousness, and Ft is a vector of prices for the unmeasured
skills. The model assumes that the price vector for the unmeasured skills is
time-varying. If Ft = f for all t, the standard fixed-effects model is obtained
by letting at = AJ/. In this example, t is not necessarily the calendar time, but
age or age cohort. Applications in this area were given by Cawley, Connelly,
Heckman, and Vytlacil (1997) and Carneiro, Hansen, and Heckman (2003). As
explained in a previous version, the model of Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis
(1999) can be extended to disentangle the worker and the firm effects, while
incorporating interactive effects. Ahn, Lee, and Schmidt (2001) provided a theoretical motivation for a single factor model based on the work of Altug and
Miller (1990) and Townsend (1994).
In the setup of Holtz-Eakin, Newey, and Rosen (1988), the slope coefficient
j8 is also time-varying. Their model can be considered as a projection of Yit
on [Xit, A,}; see Chamberlain (1984). Pesaran (2006) allowed j8 to be heterogeneous over i such that /3, = /3 + vt with v,- being i.i.d.. In this regard, the
constant slope coefficient is restrictive. To partially alleviate the restriction, it

would be useful to allow additional individual and time effects as

(4) Yit = X'itfi + at + 8t + a;.F, + eit.
Model (4) will be considered in Section 8.

Finance

Here Yit is the excess return of asset i in period t; Xit is a vector of observable

factors such as dividend yields, dividend payout ratio, and consumption gap as
in Lettau and Ludvigson (2001) or book and size factors as in Fama and French
(1993); Ft is a vector of unobservable factor returns; A, is the factor loading; eit

is the idiosyncratic return. The arbitrage pricing theory of Ross (1976) is built
upon a factor model for asset returns. Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay (1997)
provided many applications of factor models in finance.
Cross-Section Correlation

Interactive-effects models provide a tractable way to model cross-section
correlations. In the error term uit = M.Ft + eit9 each cross section shares the
same F,, causing cross-correlation. If A, = 1 for all /, and sit are i.i.d. over
i and t, an equal correlation model is obtained. In a recent paper, Andrews
(2005) showed that cross-section correlation induced by common shocks can
be problematic for inference. Andrews' analysis is confined within the framework of a single cross-section unit. In the panel data context, as shown here,
consistency and proper inference can be obtained.
3. ESTIMATION

3.1. Issues of Identification

Even in the absence of regressors Xit, the lack of identification for factor
models is well known; see Anderson and Rubin (1956) and Lawley and Maxell (1971). The current setting differs from classical factor identification in two

aspects. First, both factor loadings and factors are treated as parameters, as
opposed to factor loadings only. Second, the number of individuals N is assumed to grow without bound instead of being fixed, and it can be much larger

than the number of observations T.

yields r(r + l)/2 restrictions. This is a commonly used normalization; see
example, Connor and Korajzcyk (1986), Stock and Watson (2002), and Bai
Ng (2002). Additional r(r - l)/2 restrictions can be obtained by requiring

(7) A' A = diagonal.
These two sets of restrictions uniquely determine A and F, given the product

FA'.4 The least squares estimators for F and A derived below satisfy these

restrictions.

With either fixed N or fixed T, factor analysis would require additional restrictions. For example, the covariance matrix of et is diagonal or the covariance matrix depends on a small number of parameters via parameterization.
Under large N and large T, the cross-sectional covariance matrix of sit or the
time series covariance matrix can be of an unknown form. In particular, none
of the elements is required to be zero. However, the correlation - either cross
sectional or serial - must be weak, which we assume to hold. This is known as

the approximate factor model of Chamberlain and Rothschild (1983).
Sufficient variation in Xit is also needed. The usual identification condi-

tion for j3 is that the matrix ^ Y!L\ X[MFXi is of full rank, where MF =
IT - F(F'F)~lF'. Because F is not observable and is estimated, a stronger condition is required. See Section 4 for details.
3.2. Estimation

The least squares objective function is defined as
N

(8) SSR(j8, F, A) = Y^(Yt - Xtp - F MM - Xt{i - FA,-)
3The normalization still leaves rotation indeterminacy. For example, let G be an r x r orthog-

onal matrix, and let F* = FG and A* = AG. Then FA' = F*A*f and F*'F*/T = FF/T = I. To
remove this indeterminacy, we fix G to make A*' A* = G'A'AG a diagonal matrix. This is the
reason for restriction (7).

4Uniqueness is up to a columnwise sign change. For example, -F and -A also satisfy the

restrictions.

the maximum likelihood method allows Q to be heteroskedastic and to have

nonzero off-diagonal elements. The off-diagonal elements (due to serial correlation) must be parametrized to avoid too many free parameters. Serial correlation can also be removed by adding lagged dependent variables as regressors, leaving a diagonal /3. In contrast, the principal components method is
designed for large N and large T. In this setting, there is no need to assume a
parametric form for serial correlations. The principal components method is a
quick and effective approach to extracting common factors. Note that lagged
dependent variables lead to bias, just as serial correlation does; see Section
7. Small T models can also be estimated by the quasi-differencing approach
(Section 3.3). This latter approach also parametrizes serial correlations by including lagged dependent variables as regressors so that eit has no serial correlation. The reason to parametrize serial correlation under quasi-differencing
is that, with unrestricted serial correlation, lagged dependent variables will not

be valid instruments.

Remark 3: The estimation procedure can be modified to handle unbalanced data. The procedure is elaborated in the Supplemental material; the

details are omitted here.

3.3. Alternative Estimation Methods

While the analysis is focused on the method of least squares, we discuss several alternative estimation strategies.

Method 1: The quasi-differencing method in Holtz-Eakin, Newey, and
Rosen (1988) can be adapted for multiple factors. Consider the case of two

factors:

y it = xitfi + \nfn + \i2ft2 + eit.

Multiplying the equation yUt_i by </>, = ft\/ft-i,i and then subtracting it from
the equation yit9 we obtain

yu = 4>tyut-\ + x'itP - x'i,t-\^t + *n8t + 4,
where 8t = ft2 - ft-ia^t and s*t = sit - <£,£/,f-i- The resulting model has a single factor. If we apply the quasi-differencing method one more times to the

We use (j8°, F°) to denote the true parameters, and we still use A, without the

superscript 0 as it is not directly estimated and thus not necessary. Here F° denotes the true data generating process for F that satisfies Assumption B. This
F° in general has economic interpretations (e.g., supply shocks and demand

shocks). The estimator F below estimates a rotation of F0.6 Define SNT(P, F)

where 0,(1) is uniform. This implies the consistency of /3 for /3°. However,
we cannot claim the consistency of F for F° (or a rotation of F°) owing to its
growing dimension. Part (ii) claims that the spaces spanned by F and F° are asymptotically the same. Alternative consistency concepts, including componentwise consistency or average norm consistency, are provided in the Appendix,
as these consistency concepts are also needed.
Given consistency, we can further establish the rate of convergence.

Theorem 1 - Rate of Convergence: Assume Assumptions A-D hold. For
comparable N and T such that T/N -+ p > 0, theny/NT(fi - j3°) = 0,(1).

The theorem allows cross-section and serial correlations, as well as heteroskedasticities in both dimensions. This is important for applications in
macroeconomics, say cross-country studies, or in finance, where the factors
may not fully capture the cross-section correlations, and therefore the approximate factor model of Chamberlain and Rothschild (1983) is relevant. For microeconomic data, cross-section heteroskedasticity is likely to be present.
Although the estimator is y/NT consistent, the underlying limiting distribution will not be centered at zero; asymptotic biases exist. The next two theorems provide the limiting behavior of the estimator. The first theorem deals

Then in the absence of serial correlation and heteroskedasticity in one of

based on the argument of Hahn and Kuersteiner (2002).

Part (i) of Theorem 1 still permits cross-section correlation and het-

eroskedasticity, and part (ii) still permits serial correlation and heteroskedas-

ticity. The theorem also requires an appropriate rate for N and T. If T/N
converges to a constant, there will be a bias term due to correlation and heteroskedasticity. The next theorem is concerned with this bias. We shall deal
with the more general case in which correlation and heteroskedasticity exist in
both dimensions.

E(skék).
There will be no biases in the absence of correlations and heteroskedas-

ticities. In particular, bias Bo = 0 when cross-sectional correlation and heteroskedasticity are absent, and similarly Co = 0 when serial correlation and
heteroskedasticity are absent. To see this, consider C in (19). The absence of
serial correlation and heteroskedasticity implies Ok = v\It\ thus, MFo(lF° =

(£* ofrMpF* = 0. It follows that C = 0 and hence Co = 0. The parametric

form of serial correlations is usually removed by adding lagged dependent variables. However, lagged dependent variables lead to bias with fixed-effect estimators; see Hahn and Kuersteiner (2002) in a different context. The bias will
take a different form and is not studied here. The argument for B = 0 is not so
obvious and is provided in the proof of Theorem 2(ii). When eit are i.i.d. over
t and over i, then both Bo and Co become zero, and the result specializes to
Corollary 1. These results assume no lagged dependent variables, whose presence will lead to additional bias, which is not studied in this paper.

Remark 4: Suppose that k factors are allowed in the estimation, with k
fixed but k > r. Then /3 remains y/NT consistent, albeit less efficient than
k = r. Consistency relies on controlling the space spanned by A and that of F,

which is achieved when k > r.

Remark 5: Due to VNT consistency for /3, estimation of /3 does not affect
the rates of convergence and the limiting distributions of Ft and A,-. That is,
they are the same as that of the pure factor model of Bai (2003). This follows

6. INTERPRETATIONS OF THE ESTIMATOR

The Meaning ofD(F) and the Within-Group Interpretation

Like the least squares dummy-variable (LSDV) estimator, the interactiveeffects estimator j8 is a result of least squares with the effects being estimated.
In this sense, it is a within estimator. It is more instructive, however, to compare

the mathematical expressions of the two estimators. Write the additive-effects
model (2) in matrix form:

(20) Y = fcX1 + p2X2 + • • • + ppXp + not + Çi'N + s,
where Y and Xk (k = 1, 2, ...,/?) are matrices of T x N, with Xk being
the regressor matrix associated with parameter {5k (a scalar); iT is a T x 1
vector with all elements being 1 and similarly for iN; af = (au . . . , aN) and

£ = (f !,..., fr)'. Define

MT = IT- iTi'Tl T, MN = IN- lni!n/N.
Multiplying equation (20) by MT from the left and by M N from the right yields

MTYMN = £x(MTXlMN) + . . ■ + pp(MTXpMN) + MreMN.
The least squares dummy-variable estimator is simply the least squares applied

to the above transformed variables. The interactive-effects estimator has a sim-

ilar interpretation. Rewrite the interactive-effects model (5) as

Y = p1X1 + ... + ppXp + FA' + e.
Then left multiply MF and right multiply MA to obtain

MFYMA = fix(MFXlMA) + • • • + PP(MFXpMA) + MFeMA.
Let j3Asy be the least squares estimator obtained from the above transformed
variables, treating F and A as known. That is,

+ (^J C + o,(l),
where B and C are given by (18) and (19), respectively, and they give rise to the
biases. Their presence arises from correlations and heteroskedasticities in eit.
We show that B and C can be consistently estimated so that a bias-corrected
estimator can be constructed, as in the framework of Hahn and Kuersteiner

(2002) and Hahn and Newey (2004). Attention is paid to heteroskedasticities
in both dimensions, assuming no correlation in either dimension to simplify
the presentation. We do point out how to estimate the biases consistently and
outline the idea of the proof when correlation exists in either dimension.

9. TESTING ADDITIVE VERSUS INTERACTIVE EFFECTS

There exist two methods to evaluate which specification - fixed effects or
interactive effects - gives a better description of the data. The first method is
that of the Hausman test statistic (Hausman (1978)) and the second is based
on the number of factors. We detail the Hausman test method, delegating the
number-of-factors method to the Supplemental Material. Throughout this section, for simplicity, we assume eit are i.i.d. over i and f, and that E(s]t) - a2.
The null hypothesis is an additive-effects model

(31) Yit = Xitp + ai + & + ii + sit
with restrictions J^Li ai = 0 and JZLi €t = 0 due to the grand mean parameter fi. The alternative hypothesis - more precisely, the encompassing general

model - is

(32) Y^XitP + k'fi + e».

The null model is nested in the general model with ÀJ = (az, 1) and Ft =
(!,& + /*)'.

The interactive-effects estimator for /3 is consistent under both models (31)
and (32), but is less efficient than the least squares dummy-variable estimator
for model (31), as the latter imposes restrictions on factors and factor loadings.
But the fixed-effects estimator is inconsistent under model (32). The principle
of the Hausman test is applicable here.

The within-group estimator of /3 in (31) is

where Xt = Xt - iTXim - X + iTX... Rewrite the fixed-effects e
compactly as

v/iVT(j8FE-i8) = C-1i/r,

where C = (^ Ylti Xfii) and <A = -jTf E*Li ^'e'- The interact
timator can be written as (see Proposition A.3)

VNT(plE - j8) = D(Foyl(V - f ) + op(l),
where

(33) n^E*^,, f = ^yè[^E^
The variances of the two estimators are

var(VjVr(j3FE - j3)) = ^C"1, var(VÂ/T(j3IE - j3)) = c^DCF0)"1.
In the accompanying document, we show, under the null hypothesis of additivity,

(34) E[(V-Ç)il,'] = o-2D(F0).
This implies var(j8m - ]8fe) = var(j§iE) - var(j8FE)- Thus the Hausman test

takes the form

/ = NT(T2(pm - j8FE)/[D(F0)-1 - C-1]"1^ - j8FE) -1* X\.
Replacing D(F°) and a2 by their consistent estimators, the above is still
true. Proposition 2 shows that D(F°) is consistently estimated by Do. Let

à2 = i Ew ELi ê?p where L = NT-(N + T)r- p. Then Ô-2 -^ cr2.
Remark 9: The Hausman test is also applicable when there are no time
effects but only individual effects (i.e., & = 0). Then it is testing whether the
individual effects are time-varying. Similarly, the Hausman test is applicable
when at = 0 in (31) but Çt ^ 0. Then it is testing whether the common shocks
have heterogeneous effects on individuals. Details are given in the Supplemental Materials.

10. TIME-INVARIANT AND COMMON REGRESSORS

In earnings studies, time-invariant regressors include education, gender,
race, and so forth; common variables are those that represent trends or policies. In consumption studies, common regressors include price variables, which
are the same for each individual. Those variables are removed by the withingroup transformation. As a result, identification and estimation must rely on
other means such as the instrumental variable approach of Hausman and Taylor (1981). This section considers similar problems under interactive effects.
Under some reasonable and intuitive conditions, the parameters of the timeinvariant and common regressors are shown to be identifiable and can be consistently estimated. In effect, those regressors act as their own instruments;
additional instruments, either within or outside the system, are not necessary.
Ahn, Lee, and Schmidt (2001) allowed for time-invariant regressors, although
they did not consider the joint presence of common regressors. Their identification condition relies on nonzero correlation between factor loadings and
regressors.

A general model can be written as

(35) Yit = X'Hq> + x\y + w't8 + \'tFt + eit,
where (X'it, x'i9 w't) is a vector of observable regressors, xt is time invariant, and

wt is cross-sectionally invariant (common). The dimensions of regressors are
such that Xit is p x 1, xt is q x 1, wt is £ x 1, and Ft is r x 1. Introduce

Then the model can be rewritten as

Y, = Xlp + F\, + ei.
Let (j8°, F°, A) denote the true parameters (superscript 0 is not used for A).
To identify j8°, it was assumed in Section 4 that the matrix

That is, the matrix D(F) is positive definite when evaluated

It remains to argue that D(F°) > 0 (or equivalently, the
above) implies consistent estimation. We state this result as

Proposition 3: Assume Assumptions B-D hold. IfD(F°) >

The proof of this proposition is nontrivial and is provided i
tal Material. The proposition implies that D(F°) > 0 is a suff

Given consistency, the rest of the argument for rate of conve

is valid for regressors with variations in both dimensions. Sim

Discussion

When additive effects are also present, (35) becomes
Yit = X'it<p + li + ai + & + xfiy + u/t8 + \fiFt + eit9

where /x is the grand mean (explicitly written out), and at and £, are, respectively, the individual and the time effects. The parameters y and 8 are no
longer directly estimable. Under the restrictions of (27) and (29), the withingroup transformation implies Yit = Xit<j) + \ftFt + èit. The parameters <f> and

12. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper, we have examined issues related to identification and inference for panel data models with interactive effects. In earnings studies, the
interactive effects are a result of changing prices for a vector of unmeasured
skills. The model can also be motivated from an optimal choice of consumption
and labor supply for heterogeneous agents under a competitive economy with
complete markets. In macroeconomics, interactive effects represent common
shocks and heterogeneous impacts on the cross-units. In finance, the common
factors represent marketwide risks and the loadings reflect assets' exposure to
the risks. A factor model is also a useful approach to controlling cross-section

correlations. This paper focuses on some of the underlying eco
We showed that the convergence rate for the interactive-effec

y/NT, and this rate holds in spite of correlations and heteroskedas
dimensions. We also derived bias-corrected estimator and estimators under

additivity restrictions and their limiting distributions. We further studied the
problem of testing additive effects against interactive effects. The interactiveeffects estimator is easy to compute, and both the factor process Ft and the
factor loadings A,- can also be consistently estimated up to a rotation. Under
interactive effects, we showed that the grand mean, the coefficients of timeinvariant regressors, and the coefficients of common regressors are identifiable

and can be consistently estimated.
A useful extension is the large N and large T dynamic panel data model with
multiple interactive effects. The argument for consistency and rate of convergence remains the same, but the asymptotic bias will take a different form. An-

other broad extension is nonstationary panel data analysis, particularly panel
data cointegration, a subject that recently attracted considerable attention. In
this setup, Xit is a vector of an integrated variable and Ft can be either integrated or stationary. When Ft is integrated, then Yit9 Xit, and Ft are cointegrated. Neglecting Ft is equivalent to spurious regression and the estimation
of j8 will not be consistent. However, the interactive-effect approach can be
applied by jointly estimating the unobserved common stochastic trends Ft and
the model coefficients, leading to consistent estimation. Finally, the models
introduced in Section 10 (see Discussion) warrant further investigation.

consistency will be examined.

To prove part (ii), note that the centered objective func

Sot(j3°, F°) = 0 and, by definition, SNT(P, F) < 0. Therefore, in

0 > SNT(P, F) = SNT(P, F) + op(l).
Combined with SNT(P, F) > 0, it must be true that

SNT(P,F) = op(l).
From j8 -^> j8° = 0 and (38), it follows that the above implies

trL - ^ - ÂrJ=°-(1)-

Because A'A/N > 0 and (F°'MpF0)/ T>0, the above implies the la
is0p(l), that is,

F°'MpF° F°'F° F°'FFF°

(40) -^r- = -f - r^r= Op(1)By Assumption B, F°'F0/ T is invertible, so it follows that F°'F/ T is invertible.
Next,

\\PP - pFo\\2 = tr[(PP - PFo)2] = 2tr(/r - F'PpF/T).
But (40) implies F'PpoF/ T -A Ir, which is equivalent to \\PP - PFo || -A 0.

Note that for any positive definite matrices, A and B, the eigenvalues of AB
are the same as those of BA, A1/2BAl/29 and so forth; therefore, all eigenvalues
