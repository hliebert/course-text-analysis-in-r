ABSTRACT
Heterogeneous Employment Effects of
Job Search Programmes:
A Machine Learning Approach*
We systematically investigate the effect heterogeneity of job search programmes for
unemployed workers. To investigate possibly heterogeneous employment effects, we
combine non-experimental causal empirical models with Lasso-type estimators. The
empirical analyses are based on rich administrative data from Swiss social security records.
We find considerable heterogeneities only during the first six months after the start of
training. Consistent with previous results of the literature, unemployed persons with
fewer employment opportunities profit more from participating in these programmes.
Furthermore, we also document heterogeneous employment effects by residence status.
Finally, we show the potential of easy-to-implement programme participation rules for
improving average employment effects of these active labour market programmes.

Introduction

In this study, we employ machine learning methods for a systematic investigation of effect
heterogeneity of job search programmes (‘JSPs’ from now on) in Switzerland. Programme evaluation studies widely acknowledge the possibility of effect heterogeneity for different groups.
Stratifying the data in mutually exclusive groups or including interactions in a regression
framework are two baseline approaches to investigate effect heterogeneity (see, e.g., Athey and
Imbens, 2017a, for a review). However, these approaches may overlook important
heterogeneities because they usually do not include a systematic search based on clear, spelledout statistical rules. Furthermore, for large-scale investigations of effect heterogeneity, standard
p-values of classical (single) hypothesis tests are no longer valid because of the multiple-hypothesis testing problem (see, e.g., Lan et al., 2016, List, Shaikh, and Xu, 2016). For example,
for fifty single hypotheses tests, the probability that at least one test falsely rejects the null
hypotheses at the 5% significance level could be up to 92%.1 This could lead to so-called ex
post selection and the reporting of spurious heterogeneity that, in fact, resulted from so-called
false positives.
The disadvantages of ex post selection of significant effects have been widely
recognized in the programme-evaluation literature. For example, in randomized experiments
researchers may be required to define their analysis plan for heterogeneity prior to the
experiment to avoid only reporting (and searching for) significant effects (e.g., Casey,
Glennerster, and Miguel, 2012, Olken, 2015). However, these pre-analysis plans are inflexible
and usually not demanded (by funding bodies or editors of economic journals) in the common
case of observational studies. An alternative approach that partly alleviates the ex post selection
problem is to report effect heterogeneity for all possible groups. For large-scale investigations,
an approach that takes account of all possible differences might lead to very small groups and

thus imprecise estimates. Further, the large number of different results makes it difficult to
report the results in an intuitive way.
A developing part of the literature proposes to use machine learning algorithms (adapted
for causal analysis) to systematically search for groups with heterogeneous effects (see, e.g.,
the review of Athey and Imbens, 2017b). Potentially, machine learning approaches are
attractive because they could provide a principled approach to heterogeneity detection, which
make it less likely to leave out important heterogeneities and can reduce concerns about the
multiple testing problem. In addition, they enable flexible modelling and remain
computationally feasible, even when the covariate space becomes high-dimensional and
possibly exceeds the sample size.
In this study, we contribute to this newly developing literature in at least two ways. First,
we systematically investigate effect heterogeneity of JSPs and report them in an interpretable
way. We base the search algorithm for heterogeneity on many attributes of the unemployed
persons as well as their caseworkers. For example, we consider the employment and welfare
history of unemployed persons, socio-demographic characteristics, caseworkers’ subjective
employability ratings of their clients, and measures for the cooperativeness of caseworkers. The
latter could uncover effect heterogeneity by different monitoring intensities, which we consider
an important mechanism of JSPs (Behncke, Frölich, and Lechner, 2010a). Overall, we consider
1,268 different variables, including interactions and polynomials. Second, based on the detected
heterogeneities, we document the potential of different assignment rules to improve JSPs’
effects and cost-benefit efficiency.
Furthermore, we investigate the consistency of our findings across a variety of different
machine learning algorithms. The (still young) causal machine learning literature is lacking
large-scale sensitivity checks with regard to methodological choices in credible applications.

2

Obviously, the robustness of the results to possible misspecifications of the empirical model is
essential for drawing coherent policy conclusions.
With respect to the active labour market programme (ALMP) evaluation literature that is
based on informative data sets from administrative registers, it has become common practise to
pursue a selection-on-observables strategy to identify the programme’s effects (see, e.g.,
Imbens and Wooldridge, 2009, for standard econometric approaches and their properties, and
e.g. Card, Kluve, and Weber, 2015, for an overview and a meta analysis of evaluation studies
of active labour market programmes). We use exceptionally rich linked unemployedcaseworker data obtained from Swiss social security records.
For the investigation of effect heterogeneity, we combine Inverse Probability Weighting
(IPW) with the so-called Modified Covariate Method (MCM) (Tian et al., 2014, Chen et al.,
2017). The selection of relevant heterogeneity is carried out with Tibshirani’s (1996) Least
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). For the quantification of the effects and
their inference, we follow the sample splitting approach (see recent discussion in Rinaldo et al.
2016). We use half of the sample to select variables that are relevant to predict the size of the
heterogeneous treatment effect, i.e. that are responsible for deviations from the average effects.
We use the other half of the sample for inference on the (possibly low-dimensional) selected
variables and the heterogeneous effects.
Our results suggest substantial effect heterogeneity of Swiss JSPs during the first six
months after the start of participation. During this so-called ‘lock-in’ period, we observe negative effects for most participants. However, the size of the heterogeneity is strongly related to
the characteristics of the unemployed. Consistent with the previous literature, participants with
disadvantaged labour market characteristics benefit more from JSPs (e.g., Card, Kluve, and
Weber, 2015). A major reason is that they face generally lower lock-in effects and, thus, these
indirect programme costs are lower. Additionally, this study appears to be the first to uncover
3

substantial effect heterogeneity by residence status. We show that JSPs are more effective for
foreigners, who have less access to informal job search networks compared to locals. For
caseworker characteristics, however, there is only little heterogeneity. There is also no substantial effect heterogeneity beyond six months after the start of training. Finally, the paper presents
easy-to-implement assignment rules which would improve the current assignment mechanism
in a (almost) cost neutral way. An extensive sensitivity analysis shows that the main conclusions
remain robust across a variety of different estimation methods.
In the next section, we provide information about the institutional background of the
Swiss ALMP. In Section 3, we document the sample selection and show basic descriptive
statistics. In Section 4, we discuss the econometric approach for a principled investigation of
effect heterogeneity. In Section 5, we report the empirical findings and robustness checks.
Section 6 explains our conclusions. Additional descriptive statistics, detailed information on
the estimation of the selection procedures, and results for additional outcome variables, as well
as extensive sensitivity analyses are reported in Online Appendices A-F.

Background

2.1 Swiss institutions

Switzerland is a federal country with 26 cantons and three major language regions (French,
German, and Italian). It is a relatively wealthy country with approximately 78,000 CHF
(approx. 77,000 US-Dollar) GDP per capita and a low unemployment rate of 3 to 4% (SECO,
2017, Federal Statistical Office, 2017). Unemployed persons have to register at the regional
employment agency closest to their home.2 The employment agency pays income maintenance.
Benefits amount to 70 to 80% of the former salary depending on age, children, and past salary

2

At the beginning of the unemployment spell, newly registered unemployed persons are often sent to a one-day workshop
providing information about the unemployment law, obligations and rights, job search requirements, etc.
4

(see Behncke, Frölich, and Lechner, 2010b). The maximum benefit entitlement period is 24
months.
The yearly expenditures for Swiss ALMPs exceed 500 million CHF (Morlok et al., 2014).
Unemployed persons can participate in a variety of different ALMPs. Gerfin and Lechner
(2002) classify these ALMPs as (a) training courses, (b) employment programmes, and (c)
temporary employment schemes. Training courses include job search, personality, language,
computer, and vocational programmes. We focus on JSPs in this study, which is the most
common ALMP in Switzerland (more than 50% of the assigned ALMPs are JSPs, see Huber,
Lechner, and Mellace, 2017). JSPs provide training in effective job search and application
strategies (e.g., training in résumé writing). Furthermore, actual applications are screened and
monitored. JSPs are relatively short, with an average duration of about three weeks. Training
takes place in class rooms. The employment agency covers the costs of training and travel.
Participants are obliged to continue to search for jobs during the course.
In Switzerland, regional employment agencies have a large degree of autonomy, which
is partly related to the country’s federal organisation. Caseworkers make the decision to assign
unemployed persons to a training course based on information about the unemployed person
(e.g. employment history, subjective employability rating, etc.). Additionally, employment
agency policies and federal eligibility rules are relevant for the assignment decision. The federal
eligibility rules are rather vague. They imply, for example, that the training has to be necessary
and adequate to improve the individual’s employment chances. Caseworkers can essentially
force the unemployed into such courses by threatening to impose sanctions. Unemployed
persons have the option to apply to participate in such courses, but the final decision is always
made by the caseworkers.

2.2 Related literature on job search programmes (JSPs)

An assignment to a JSP may affect the matching process and quality alignment between the
participant and his or her potential new job (see, e.g., Blasco and Rosholm, 2011, Cottier et al.,
2017). Push effects could occur if participants accept jobs with low matching quality because
of actual or perceived sanctions or perceived future ALMP assignments. Push effects decrease
the duration of unemployment, but may reduce employment stability. On the other hand, JSP
participation could improve the visibility of suitable job vacancies and the efficiency of the
application process, which may improve employment stability. Furthermore, many studies are
concerned with the crowding-out of non-participants (see, e.g., Blundell et al., 2004, Crépon et
al., 2013, Gautier et al., 2017).
Empirical evidence about the effectiveness of JSPs is mixed. The review studies of
Card, Kluve, and Weber (2010, 2015) as well as Crépon and van den Berg (2016) document a
weak tendency towards positive effects of JSPs, especially in the short-term.3 However, for
Swiss JSPs, the literature finds negative employment effects, which taper off one year after the
start of participation (see Gerfin and Lechner, 2002, Lalive, van Ours, and Zweimüller, 2008).
One reason for the ambiguous effectiveness of JSPs might be the different relative intensities
of job search training and monitoring. Van den Berg and van der Klaauw (2006) are concerned
that intensive monitoring reduces an informal job search, which might be a more efficient
strategy than a formal job search for some unemployed persons. They suggest a formal job
search is more effective for individuals with fewer labour market opportunities. Consistent with
their arguments, Card, Kluve, and Weber (2015) document that JSPs are relatively more
effective for disadvantaged participants. Vikström, Rosholm, and Svarer (2013) find slightly

3

Meyer (1995) reports negative effects on unemployment benefit payments and positive earnings effects of JSPs in the US.
Graversen and van Ours (2008) and Rosholm (2008) report positive effects of JSPs on the unemployment exit rate in
Denmark. Wunsch and Lechner (2008) find JSPs have negative effects during the first two years after a programme begins,
which fade out afterwards in Germany. They also show that training sequences are responsible for long lasting negative
lock-in effects.

more positive effects of JSPs for women and younger participants. Dolton and O’Neill (2002)
report negative employment effects of JSPs for men and insignificant effects for women five
years after the programme begins. Surprisingly, the programme evaluation literature is lacking
large-scale evidence about the effect heterogeneity of JSPs.

Data

3.1 General

The data we use includes all individuals who are registered as unemployed at a Swiss regional
employment agency in the year 2003. The data contains rich information from different unemployment insurance databases (AVAM/ASAL) and social security records (AHV). This is
the standard data used for many Swiss ALMP evaluations (e.g. Gerfin and Lechner, 2002,
Lalive, van Ours, and Zweimüller, 2008, Lechner and Smith, 2007). We observe (among others)
residence status, qualification, education, language skills, employment history, profession, job
position, industry of last job, and desired occupation and industry. The administrative data is
linked with regional labour market characteristics, such as the population size of municipalities
and the cantonal unemployment rate. The availability of extensive caseworker information and
their subjective assessment of the employability of their clients is what distinguish our data.
Swiss caseworkers employed in the period of 2003 to 2004 were surveyed through a written
questionnaire in December 2004 (see Behncke, Frölich, and Lechner, 2010a, 2010b). The
questionnaire asked about the caseworker’s aims and strategies and information about the
regional employment agency.

7

3.2 Sample definition

In total, 238,902 persons registered as being unemployed in 2003. We only consider the first
unemployment registration per individual in 2003. Each registered unemployed person is assigned to a caseworker. In most cases, the same caseworker is responsible for the entire
unemployment duration of his or her client. If this is not the case, we focus on the first
caseworker to avoid concerns about (rare) endogenous caseworker changes (see Behncke,
Frölich, and Lechner, 2010b). We only consider unemployed persons aged between 24 and 55
years who receive unemployment insurance benefits. We omitted unemployed persons who
apply for disability insurance benefits, persons whose responsible caseworker is not clearly
defined, or persons whose caseworker did not answer the questionnaire (the response rate is
84%). We omitted unemployed foreigners with a residence permit that is valid for less than a
year. Finally, we omitted unemployed persons from five regional employment agencies that are
not comparable to the other regional employment agencies. This sample is identical to the data
used in Huber, Lechner, and Mellace (2017). It contains 100,120 unemployed persons.
One concern regarding the treatment definition is the timing with respect to the elapsed
unemployment duration prior to participation. Caseworkers may assign unemployed persons to
job training programmes at essentially anytime during their unemployment spell. The dynamic
or sequential programme assignment has received considerable attention in evaluation literature
(see the discussions in Abbring and van den Berg, 2003, 2004, Fredriksson and Johansson,
2008, Heckman and Navarro, 2007, Lechner, 2009, Robins, 1986, Sianesi, 2004, among others).
We consider a classical static evaluation model and define treatment as the first participation in
a JSP during the first six months of unemployment (83% of JSP are assigned within the first
six months of unemployment). We exclude individuals who participate in other ALMPs within
the first six months of unemployment from the sample, such that our control group represents
non-participants of all programmes (8,787 other ALMP participants are dropped). Potentially,
this approach could lead to a higher share of individuals with better labour market
8

characteristics among the control group than among the training participants, because
individuals in the control group may have possibly found another job prior to their potential
treatment times. This would negatively bias the results. To overcome this concern, we randomly
assign (pseudo) participation starts to each individual in the control group. Thereby, we recover
the distribution of the elapsed unemployment duration at the time of training participation from
the treatment group (similar to, e.g., Lechner, 1999, Lechner and Smith, 2007). To ensure
comparability of the treatment deﬁnitions of the participants and non-participants, we only
consider individuals who are unemployed at their (pseudo) treatment dates. This makes the
groups of participants and non-participants comparable with respect to the duration of unemployment and ensures that the treated and control groups are eligible for programme
participation at their respective assigned start dates.
The final sample contains 85,198 unemployed persons (Table A.1 in Online Appendix A
provides the details of the sample selections steps). From this sample, 12,998 unemployed
persons participate in a JSP and 72,200 are members of the control group. These 85,198
unemployed persons are assigned to 1,282 different caseworkers.

3.3 Descriptive statistics

Table 1 reports the means and standard deviations by JSP participation for some selected
variables. During the first 6 months after training begins, JSP participants are fewer months
employed than non-participants. The standardised difference is above 20.4 During the first 12
and 31 months after training begins, JSP participants also have a shorter employment duration

4

The standardised difference of variable 𝑋𝑋 between samples 𝐴𝐴 and 𝐵𝐵 is defined as
𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 =

|𝑋𝑋�𝐴𝐴 − 𝑋𝑋�𝐵𝐵 |

�1⁄2 �𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉(𝑋𝑋�𝐴𝐴 ) + 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉(𝑋𝑋�𝐵𝐵 )�

∙ 100,

where 𝑋𝑋�𝐴𝐴 denotes the mean of sample 𝐴𝐴 and 𝑋𝑋�𝐵𝐵 denotes the mean of sample 𝐵𝐵. Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) consider a
standardised difference of more than 20 as being ‘large’.

than non-participants, but the standardised differences decline. During months 25 to 31 after
training begins, the difference in the employment duration is minor.

Furthermore, Table 1 documents descriptive statistics of the characteristics of the

conditions. We report the descriptive statistics for additional control variables in Table B.1 of
Online Appendix B. JSP participants have spent more months employed and received a higher
income than non-participants in the last two years prior to the programme’s start. We document
minimal difference between the caseworkers of participants and non-participants.5 JSP
participants are more often registered at German-speaking regional employment agencies and
live in cantons with better economic conditions (in terms of local GDP and unemployment rate)
than non-participants.

Econometric approach

4.1 Parameters of interest

We describe the parameters of interest using Rubin’s (1974) potential outcome framework.
Following the conventional notation, we indicate random variables by capital letters and the
realizations of these random variables by lowercase letters. The binary treatment dummy 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖

indicates JSP participation. Let 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖1 denote the potential outcome (e.g., employment) when
individual 𝑖𝑖 (𝑖𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑁𝑁) participates in a JSP (𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 = 1). Conversely, 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖0 denotes the potential

outcome when individual 𝑖𝑖 is not participating in a JSP (𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 = 0). Obviously, each individual

can either participate in a JSP or not, but both participation states cannot occur simultaneously.
This implies only one potential outcome is observable. The observed outcome equals
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 = 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖1 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 + 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖0 (1 − 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 ).

The causal effect of 𝐷𝐷 on 𝑌𝑌 for individual 𝑖𝑖 is

𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 = 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖1 − 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖0 .

5

In Table B.1 of Online Appendix B we also show caseworker characteristics interacted with the language of the regional
employment agency. For some interacted variables, we find strong differences between participants and non-participants.
11

However, we cannot identify the parameter 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 without assumptions that are implausible in many

applications (e.g., effect homogeneity). Nevertheless, group averages of 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 may be identifiable
under plausible assumptions. For example, the identification of the average treatment effect

(ATE), 𝛾𝛾 = 𝐸𝐸[𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 ], the average treatment effect on the treated (ATET), 𝜃𝜃 = 𝐸𝐸[𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 |𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 = 1], and

the average treatment effect on the non-treated (ATENT), 𝜌𝜌 = 𝐸𝐸[𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 |𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 = 0], are standard

econometric problems (see, e.g., Imbens and Wooldridge, 2009). Furthermore, conditional

average treatment effects (CATEs) can potentially uncover effect heterogeneity based on
exogenous pre-treatment variables 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 chosen by the researcher based on the policy interest,
𝛾𝛾(𝑧𝑧) = 𝐸𝐸[𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 |𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧] = 𝐸𝐸[𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖1 − 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖0 |𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧].

Knowledge about CATEs could help, e.g., to improve the assignment mechanism to JSPs.6

4.2 Econometric background and intuition

Machine learning methods are powerful tools for out-of-sample predictions of observable variables. However, the fundamental problem of causal analyses is the inability to observe
individual causal effects because at least one potential outcome is unobservable. Recently,
several methods have been proposed that apply machine learning methods in ways that
overcome this fundamental problem (see, e.g., the reviews by Belloni, Chernozhukov, and
Hansen, 2014, Horowitz, 2015, and Varian, 2014).
Concerning effect heterogeneity, Imai and Ratkovic (2013) suggest a LASSO-type
algorithm while Athey and Imbens (2016) propose a regression tree method. Foster, Taylor,
and Ruberg (2011) apply random forest algorithms to estimate effect heterogeneity. These
algorithms are flexible and are effective at capturing multi-dimensional and non-linear

6

Additional parameters are CATEs for JSP participants 𝜃𝜃(𝑧𝑧) = 𝐸𝐸[𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 |𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 = 1, 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧] and CATEs for non-participants 𝜌𝜌(𝑧𝑧) =

𝐸𝐸[𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 |𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 = 0, 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧]. The parameters 𝛾𝛾(𝑧𝑧), 𝜃𝜃(𝑧𝑧), and 𝜌𝜌(𝑧𝑧) can differ from each other when 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 differs from 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 (which is

the case in our application). However, we are interested in the heterogeneities for a random unemployed person with specific
characteristics because this mirrors the decision problem of the caseworker. Thus, we focus on 𝛾𝛾(𝑧𝑧).
12

interactions among covariates. Imai and Strauss (2011), Green and Kern (2012), and Taddy et
al. (2015) propose alternative Bayesian machine learning methods to estimate effect heterogeneity. Grimmer, Messing, and Westwood (2016) do not attempt to use the best method
available. Instead, they suggest combining many different machine-learning tools to estimate
the conditional treatment responses. Athey and Wager (2017), Qian and Murphy (2011), Xu et
al. (2015), and Zhao et al. (2012) focus on the estimation of individualized treatment rules,
which primarily focus on decision rules instead of effect heterogeneity.7
All of these studies consider heterogeneity in randomized experiments. In many fields
of economics, randomized experiments are expensive and minimally socially acceptable.
Therefore, we consider a selection-on-observables identification strategy (e.g. Imbens,
Wooldridge, 2009). A promising approach to estimate group specific causal effects in nonexperimental approaches is the Modified Covariate Method (MCM).8
To gain some intuition about the MCM, we first consider that participation in a
programme is randomly assigned to 50% of the unemployed persons. Accordingly, in this
introductory example there is no need to adjust for selection into training participation.
Throughout the analyses the first element in 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 is a constant term (𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖0 = 1) and the remaining

elements of 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 contain additional 𝑝𝑝 ≥ 1 pre-treatment variables that are potentially related to
the effect heterogeneity in which the researcher is interested. A standard approach to estimate
effect heterogeneity is to use the interaction model,
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 = 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠 + 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 𝛿𝛿 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 .

Closely related is the study of Ciarleglio et al. (2015), who propose a method to select the optimal treatment conditional on
observed individual characteristics. Zhao et al. (2015) investigate the optimal dynamic order of sequential treatments.

Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2012) develop alternative non-experimental approaches for a principled effected heterogeneity
search, which is an adaptation of the Modified Outcome Method (MOM) (Signorovitch, 2007). We describe the MOM in
Online Appendix F.1. For one of the robustness checks, we replicate our results using the MOM. Furthermore, the tree and
forest methods of Athey and Imbens (2016) and Wager and Athey (2017) are applicable in non-experimental settings. All
robustness checks are provided in Section 5.7 and Online Appendix F. The main findings are not altered.

The first term on the right side of equation (1) provides a linear approximation of the conditional
expectation of the potential outcome under non-participation, 𝐸𝐸[𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖0 |𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧] = 𝑧𝑧𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠 . We call this

the main effects in the following. The second term on the right-hand side of equation (1) provides a linear approximation of the CATE:
𝛾𝛾(𝑧𝑧) = 𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧 = 𝐸𝐸[𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖1 − 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖0 |𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧].

Vansteelandt et al. (2008) point at possible sensitivities of the empirical model in equation (1)
when the main effects are miss-specified. Tian et al. (2014) propose to transform the treatment
dummy 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 = 2𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 − 1 and rearrange the interaction model in equation (1) to:
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 = 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡 +

𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖
𝛿𝛿 + 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 .
2

(2)

The treatment indicator shifts from 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 ∈ {0,1} to 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 ⁄2 ∈ {−0.5,0.5}. The modification does not

alter the coefficient vector 𝛿𝛿. However, this transformation alters the main effects. In equation

(2), 𝐸𝐸[𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 |𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧] = 𝑧𝑧𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡 is the linear approximation of the conditional expectation of the ob-

served outcome. Notice that 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 )𝐸𝐸[𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 ] = 0 for 𝑗𝑗, 𝑘𝑘 ∈ {1, … , 𝑝𝑝}.
The first equality holds under random assignment of training participation and the second

equality holds because 𝐸𝐸[𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 ] = 0.9 Accordingly, the right hand terms of equation (2) are

independent of each other and we can estimate the coefficients 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡 and 𝛿𝛿 in two separate
regressions. For example, we can estimate CATEs with the model
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 =

𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖
𝛿𝛿 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖 ,
2

which is the baseline model of the MCM. The MCM is suitable when only the interaction effects
and not the main effects are of interest. Parsimony and robustness to misspecification of the
main effects are two advantages of the MCM compared to the specification in equation (1). We
can adopt the basic idea of the MCM to non-experimental identification strategies (see Chen et

9

In contrast, 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 )𝐸𝐸[𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 ] = 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗 , 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 )/2, which can be different from zero.

al., 2017). Furthermore, we can combine the MCM with different machine learning methods to
select the variables for heterogeneity. Procedure 1 summarises our (main) estimation algorithm
of the adapted MCM approach, which we describe in detail below.

4.3 Identification

In addition to the pre-treatment variables included in the vector 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 (which are potentially related

to effect heterogeneity), we consider the possibility of confounding variables, which are included in the vector 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 . Confounders are pre-treatment variables that jointly affect the prob-

ability to participate in a JSP and the employment outcome. The vector 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 may be larger,
smaller, partially, or fully overlapping with 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 depending on the question under investigation.

Assumption 1 (Conditional independence): 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖1 , 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖0 ∐D𝑖𝑖 |X𝑖𝑖 = x, Z𝑖𝑖 = z for all values of 𝑥𝑥 and 𝑧𝑧
in the support of 𝑋𝑋 and 𝑍𝑍.

Assumption 2 (Common support): 0 < 𝑃𝑃(𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 = 1|𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 𝑥𝑥, 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧) = 𝑝𝑝(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 , 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 ) < 1 for all
values of 𝑥𝑥 and 𝑧𝑧 in the support (of interest) of 𝑋𝑋 and 𝑍𝑍.

Assumption 3 (Exogeneity of controls): 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖1 = 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖0 and 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖1 = 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖0 .

Assumption 4 (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption, SUTVA): 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 = 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖1 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 + 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖0 (1 − 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 ).
Assumption 1 states that the potential outcomes are independent of programme

participation conditional on the confounding pre-treatment variables. The plausibility of this
assumption is justified by the availability of a detailed set of confounding variables containing
characteristics of the unemployed and the caseworkers. The studies of Biewen et al. (2014) and
Lechner and Wunsch (2013) discuss the selection of confounders in ALMP evaluations based
on rich administrative data. Within the employment agency, caseworkers have high autonomy
to decide about assignment of JSPs. Our data contain the same objective measures about labour
market history, education and socio-demographics of the unemployed, as well as local labour
market characteristics that are observable to the caseworkers when choosing who participates
15

in JSPs. We observe caseworkers’ subjective ratings of the employability of their clients.
Furthermore, we observe detailed information about the caseworkers’ characteristics and
counselling styles. These are potential confounders, because caseworker characteristics might
affect the probability of JSP participation and labour market outcomes simultaneously.
According to Assumption 2, the conditional probability to participate in a JSP is
bounded away from zero and one. The common support assumption has to hold when
conditioning jointly on 𝑋𝑋 and 𝑍𝑍. We enforce common support by trimming observations below

the 0.5 quantile of participants and above the 99.5 quantile of non-participants.10 This procedure
shows good finite sample performance in the study Lechner and Strittmatter (2017).
Assumption 3 requires exogeneity of confounding and heterogeneity variables. To account for
this assumption, we only use control variables that are determined prior to the start of JSP
participation. Assumption 4 excludes spillover effects between participants and nonparticipants.
Theorem 1 (Identification): Under Assumptions 1-4 (and regularity conditions ensuring the
existence of appropriate moments) the following equality holds:
𝛾𝛾(𝑧𝑧) = 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋|𝑍𝑍=𝑧𝑧 [𝐸𝐸(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 | 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 = 1, 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 𝑥𝑥, 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧)|𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧]

− 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋|𝑍𝑍=𝑧𝑧 [𝐸𝐸(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 | 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 = 0, 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 𝑥𝑥, 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧)|𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧].

Thus γ ( z ) are identified from observable data on {𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 , 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 , 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 , 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 }𝑁𝑁
𝑖𝑖=1 . For completeness, the proof

of Theorem 1 is in Online Appendix C (see also, e.g., Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983).

4.4 Search for effect heterogeneity

Chen et al. (2017) outline how we can combine MCM with Inverse Probability Weighting
(IPW), a standard approach to balance covariates in observational studies (see, e.g., Hirano,

10

In total, we trim 6,767 observations (579 participants, 6,188 non-participants).
16

Imbens, and Ridder, 2003, Horvitz and Thompson, 1952). We can estimate the parameter vector
𝛿𝛿 using Weighted Ordinary Least Squares (WOLS), i.e. by minimising the objective function

which we calculate using the estimated propensity score 𝑝𝑝̂ (𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 , 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 ). In our baseline model, we

adapt the propensity score specification of Huber, Lechner, and Mellace (2017), which we report in Table D.1 of Online Appendix D. The denominator of the IPW weights causes a small
sample adjustment (see, e.g., Busso, DiNardo, and McCrary, 2014). In equation (3), we multiply the IPW weights by 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 , such that the weights are positive.

The variables included in 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 , which are potentially related to effect heterogeneity, con-

sist of individual and caseworker characteristics, their second order interactions, up to fourth

order polynomials, and logarithms of non-binary variables. Additionally, we consider dummy
variables for the 103 employment agencies as well as 29 category dummies for previous
industry and 29 category dummies describing the previous job. In total, this leads to 1,268
heterogeneity variables that we consider in the analyses.11
In our main specifications, we employ LASSO estimators. The weighted LASSO
estimator of the MCM minimizes the objective function,

We exclude binary variables where less than 1% of (non-) participants show values of 0 or 1. Furthermore, we keep only

17

where we add a penalty term for the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of the 𝑝𝑝

variables appearing in 𝑍𝑍. Importantly, we do not penalize the constant 𝛿𝛿̂0 . The penalising

parameter 𝜆𝜆 specifies the amount of penalisation. If 𝜆𝜆 = 0, then equation (4) is equivalent to

the WOLS model in equation (3). However, when 𝜆𝜆 > 0 some coefficients are shrunken

towards zero. For sufficiently large values of 𝜆𝜆, some (or all) coefficients are exactly zero.

Therefore, the LASSO serves as a model selector, omitting variables with little predictive power
from the model.12 A challenge is the optimization of the penalty term, such that only the relevant
predictors of the effect heterogeneity remain in the model. Too low penalties lead to overfitting,
too high penalties lead to models that miss important variables (i.e., we have a bias-variance
trade-off).
We apply 10-fold cross-validation to find the penalty term 𝜆𝜆 with the best out-of-sample

performance in terms of mean-squared-error (MSE) (e.g., Bühlmann and van de Geer, 2011).13
The LASSO coefficients are biased when 𝜆𝜆 > 0 (regularisation bias, see, e.g., Zou, 2006). For
this reason, we use the so-called Post-LASSO estimates to calculate the MSE. We obtain the

Post-LASSO coefficients from a WOLS model, which includes all variables with non-zero
coefficients in the respective LASSO model (see, e.g. Belloni, Chernozhukov, Hansen, 2013).
We choose the LASSO model with the penalty parameter 𝜆𝜆 that minimises the Post-LASSO

MSE.14

There is no need to specify the main effects in the MCM approach. Nevertheless, Tian et
al. (2014) and Chen et al. (2017) show that accounting for the main effects can improve the
finite sample performance of the MCM because they can absorb variation in the outcome, which

12

13

14

The larger the values of 𝜆𝜆 the fewer variables remain in the model. By gradually increasing the penalty term one can obtain

a path from a full model to a model that only contains the parameter 𝛿𝛿̂0 .

Chetverikov, Liao, and Chernozhukov (2017) discuss the properties of K-fold cross-validation in the context of LASSO.
They derive bounds for the prediction errors of cross-validated LASSO estimators.
In robustness checks, we base the selection of the penalty parameter on the LASSO MSE. The main results are not altered.
18

is unrelated to the effect heterogeneity. In Online Appendix F.2, we document two ways to
implement an efficiency augmenting procedure.
Note that in case Z contains additional variables to the confounders 𝑋𝑋, there is some

concern that including Z in the estimation of the propensity score might inflate the propensity
score without removing additional selection bias. Therefore, our main specification is based on
𝑝𝑝(𝑥𝑥) only. We also estimate specifications allowing 𝑍𝑍 to enter the propensity score as well,
𝑝𝑝(𝑥𝑥, 𝑧𝑧) (see Appendix F.5). However, besides decreasing the precision of the estimates, the
main results are not altered.

4.5 Estimation of CATEs

To avoid the situation in which the LASSO approach models idiosyncratic within-sample
effects, we randomly partition the sample into two equal sized parts. We assume independence
between the two samples. We use the first sample to select the relevant effect heterogeneity
variables (training sample). We use the second sample for the estimation of a WOLS model
including all selected heterogeneity variables (estimation sample). This is called the ‘honest’
inference procedure (see the discussion about the general properties, e.g., in Fithian, Sun, and
Taylor, 2017).
The CATE for individual 𝑖𝑖 is estimated as 𝛾𝛾�(𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 𝛿𝛿̂ . All coefficients of variables not

selected in the training sample are set to zero. The coefficients of the selected variables are
estimated in the estimation sample and extrapolated to the full sample. The medical and
biometric literature calls 𝛾𝛾�(𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 ) individualised treatment effects (ITE) (e.g., Chen et al., 2017).

The estimates of 𝛿𝛿̂ vary with respect to the random sample split. To reduce the dependency of
the results on a particular split, we run the analyses 𝑆𝑆 = 30 times with different random splits.
We calculate the individualised CATEs, 𝛾𝛾�𝑠𝑠 (𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 𝛿𝛿̂𝑠𝑠 , for each split, where the Post-LASSO

coefficients, 𝛿𝛿̂𝑠𝑠 , are from the random sample split 𝑠𝑠. We use these parameters to calculate the
19

1

aggregated CATEs, 𝛾𝛾̅ (𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝑆𝑆 ∑𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠=1 𝛾𝛾�𝑠𝑠 (𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 ). This procedure is in the spirit of bootstrap
aggregation (`bagging`) in machine learning literature (see, e.g., Breiman, 1996). It reduces

model dependency and smooths the estimated CATEs, but the estimation model of 𝛾𝛾̅ (𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 ) is

more difficult to interpret than the model of 𝛾𝛾�(𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 ). To understand which factors influence the
aggregated CATEs, we report averages by different groups,

𝛾𝛾̅𝑔𝑔 =

1

∑𝑁𝑁
𝑖𝑖=1 𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖

𝑁𝑁

� 𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖 𝛾𝛾̅ (𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 ),
𝑖𝑖=1

where the binary variable 𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖 indicates whether individual 𝑖𝑖 belongs to the group (𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖 = 1) or not

(𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖 = 0). These groups could, for example, be all JSP participants, all non-participants, or
unemployed persons with specific characteristics.

4.6 Variance estimation

It appears natural to estimate the variance with a bootstrap approach over the whole estimation
algorithm, including the variable selection step. However, this is computationally infeasible for
a reasonable number of bootstrap replications. Thus, we use a computationally feasible
bootstrap approach in which we fix the selected heterogeneity variables in each sample split.
First, we draw a random bootstrap sample 𝑏𝑏 (with replacement) clustered on the

caseworker level. Second, for each sample split, we align the observations in the bootstrap
sample to the observations in the original estimation sample. We only keep observations that
we observe in both the bootstrap and the estimation sample. Third, based on these samples, we
re-estimate the CATEs for each sample split using the heterogeneity variables selected in the
original training sample of the respective sample split. We repeat these three steps 1,000 times.
This procedure takes into account the dependencies that stem from overlapping observations
across sample splits.

Results

5.1 Propensity score model

Table D.1 in Appendix D reports the average marginal effects of the estimated propensity score
model. The propensity score estimates serve as inputs into the matching algorithm. The results
21

confirm the impression from the descriptive statistics in Table 1, namely that the participation
probability is generally increasing with previous labour market success. Unemployed persons
with good labour market opportunities have a greater probability to participate in a JSP. Such
a selection of training participants is called ‘cream-skimming’ (e.g., Bell and Orr, 2002). The
effect of training is not necessarily higher for participants with good labour market
opportunities, because these participants would have good labour market opportunities even in
the absence of training (see, e.g., discussion in Berger, Black, and Smith, 2000).
When performing matching, it is a best practice to check for potential issues of (i)
insufficient support in the propensity scores across treatment states that may result in
incomparable matches as well as large matching weights of some non-treated observations with
specific propensity scores; and (ii) imbalances in covariates after matching (due to inappropriate
propensity score specifications). We document the distribution of the baseline propensity score
in Figure D.1 of Online Appendix D. Furthermore, we document the balancing of the control
variables after matching in Table D.2 of Online Appendix D. We find only small imbalances
between JSP participants and non-participants. The standardised differences are always below
three.

5.2 Average effects

Figure 1 shows the estimated potential outcomes and average programme effects on
employment for each of the first 31 months after the programme’s start. We observe substantial
negative lock-in effects. The employment probability in the first three months is about 15
percentage points lower for JSP participants compared to non-participants. However,
differences in the two groups’ employment probability disappear after 16 months. In months
22 to 24 after a programme’s start, we find small positive effects. But this seems to be only of
short duration. Overall, the long-term effects are insignificant and close to zero. The negative
lock-in effects are consistent with the findings of the previous Swiss JSP evaluations (e.g.,
22

Gerfin and Lechner, 2002, Lalive, van Ours, and Zweimüller, 2008). Moreover, the
effectiveness of JSPs is also negative in other countries (see e.g., Dolton and O’Neil, 2002,
Wunsch and Lechner, 2008). It is possible that participants reduce the intensity of informal job
search during participation in a JSP, which could explain negative employment effects.
Searching for effect heterogeneity in each month after a programme’s start is
computationally expensive and hard to intuitively summarise (at least if it varies over time).
Therefore, we estimate the effects of JSP participation on cumulated months employed during
the first 6, 12, and 31 months after a programme begins, as well as during months 25 to 31.
Table 2 shows the respective average effects that mirror the findings in Figure 1. The lower
employment probabilities after programme participation translate into an average decline of 0.8
employment months (≈ -24 days) during the first six months after the start of participation. This
decreases to -1.1 months (≈ -33 days) during the first 12 and 31 months. We find no significant
employment effects during the months 25 to 31 after the start of participation.

participation.

Note:

We estimate the ATE and ATET separately for each of the first 31 months after start of JSP participation.
Circles/triangles indicate significant effects at the 5% level. We obtain standard errors from a clustered bootstrap at
caseworker level with 4,999 replications.

5.3 Effect heterogeneity

Table 3 reports the estimated heterogeneity coefficients, 𝛿𝛿̂ , obtained from one of the considered

random partitions into training and estimation samples.15 The coefficients are the marginal effects of the respective variables on the treatment effect of JSP (as opposed to the marginal
effects of the respective variables on the outcome level in standard linear regression models).
The first column of Table 3 reports the estimated coefficients for the outcome cumulated

employment during the first six months after training participation begins. In this specification,
the Post-LASSO estimation selects 17 out of 1,268 potential variables. In the estimation sample,
five of these variables are significant; for example, the treatment effect increments by 0.3
months (≈ 9 days) for unskilled workers with previous earnings below 25,000 CHF a year (see
row 3). When all other selected variables equal zero, the predicted effect of JSP participation
for unskilled workers with previous earnings below 25,000 CHF a year would be -0.89 + 0.3 =

−0.59 months employment (≈ -17 days). However, we must be cautious when interpreting the
model, because it is selected to maximise prediction power, which might differ from the
structural (causal) model (see, e.g., discussion in Mullainathan and Spiess, 2017).

15

We omit the coefficients of the main effects because they are only used for the efficiency augmentation and irrelevant for
the interpretation.

The second column of Table 3 shows the coefficients for the thirteen selected
heterogeneity variables for the outcome cumulated employment during the first twelve months
after training participation begins. The selected heterogeneity variables are partially
overlapping between the two outcomes (comp. column 1 and 2). In Table E.1 in Online
Appendix E, we report the selected heterogeneity parameters for the outcome cumulated
25

months employed in the first 31 months after training participation begins. We omit the results
for the outcome cumulated months employed between months 25 to 31 after training
participation begins, because we do not detect any effect heterogeneity in the considered sample
split.
To improve precision and check the sensitivity of our results, we investigate the PostLASSO models for different random sample splits. For each random partition, we obtain
different Post-LASSO models (Table F.6 in Online Appendix F documents the number of
selected variables in the different random sample splits). This is unsurprising, because many of
the variables we consider are highly correlated (e.g., different measures of the employment
history). Therefore, the same CATE can be obtained from different Post-LASSO models, each
considering different variables or different functions of variables. Table F.1 in Online Appendix
F documents the average correlation between CATEs for different sample splits. The
correlations are positive and relatively large. Accordingly, the CATEs are highly consistent
across the considered sample splits. This confirms that the selected models are not identical,
but each model essentially predicts the similar CATEs.
One approach to get an overview of the detected heterogeneities is to plot the
distribution of the predicted effects. Therefore, Figure 2 reports the distribution of the
aggregated CATEs of JSPs on cumulated months employed during the first six months after
participation begins. The figure documents substantial variation in the aggregated CATEs. For
most groups of unemployed persons the aggregated CATE of JSP participation is between -0.8
and -1 months of employment (approximately a decline of between 24 and 30 days). However,
the CATEs are less negative or even positive for a non-negligible fraction of the unemployed
persons. This points at potential ways to improve assignment to a JSP.

selection and estimation sample. We choose the penalty term based on Post-LASSO RMSE, which we optimise
with 10-fold cross-validation. The dashed vertical line shows the ATE.

Table 4 reports summary statistics for the aggregated CATEs. For all outcomes, the means
of the aggregated CATEs are close to the (semi-parametrically) estimated ATEs (comp. Table
2). This confirms that the estimation of the aggregated CATEs works well, on average. For all
outcomes, the median is slightly lower than the mean. This suggests a right-skewed distribution
(similar to Figure 2). We find substantial heterogeneity for the outcomes cumulated months
employed during the first 12 months and the first 31 months after the start of JSP participation.
After 12 months, the JSP effect ranges from minus two to plus two employment months. After
31 months, the JSP effect ranges from minus three to plus three employment months. However,
for the outcome cumulated months employed between month 25 and 31 after the start of JSP
participation we find little heterogeneity.

We obtain CATEs from aggregating CATEs from 30 different random sample splits. Standard deviations are
abbreviated with S.D. in column (3). Column (6) shows mean standard errors of CATEs.

Accordingly, the MCM successfully discovers substantial effect heterogeneity.
However, interpretation of the results is not easily accessible, because the underlying functions
are too complex. Figure 2 and Table 4 document two ways to aggregate the results. However,
we want to go beyond these abstract descriptions and make explicit policy recommendations.
In the next section, we marginalise the effects for specific variables of interest. This enables us
to reveal more of the CATEs’ structure. Afterwards, we focus on the implementation of specific
JSP assignment rules.

5.4 Effect heterogeneity by selected variables

In this section, we average CATEs by characteristics of unemployed persons and their caseworkers. For each characteristic, we partition the sample in two mutually exclusive groups (high
𝑔𝑔 = 1 and low 𝑔𝑔 = 0 group), by using a binary characteristic itself as indicator or by
discretising at the median of non-binary characteristics. The parameters 𝛾𝛾̅𝑔𝑔=1 and 𝛾𝛾̅𝑔𝑔=0 average

the CATEs over all unemployed in the respective group.

Figure 3 reports effect heterogeneity of JSP participation on cumulated months
employed during the first six months after the start of participation by low and high values of
the characteristics of unemployed persons. The groups in the top of Figure 3 show the largest
effect heterogeneities. For groups at the bottom of Figure 3 we find only little effect
heterogeneity. We estimate the largest degree of effect heterogeneity for unskilled workers. The
28

average effect of unskilled unemployed is 0.26 months (≈ 8 days) longer than for unemployed
persons in other skill categories (see Table E.2 in Online Appendix E).
Figure 3: CATEs on cumulated employment during the first 6 months after start JSP
participation by characteristics of unemployed persons.

Note:

CATEs by low and high values of the respective characteristic of unemployed persons. A low value is zero when
the variable is binary or below the median when the variable is non-binary. A high value is one when the variable is
binary or not below the median when the variable is non-binary. The CATEs are based on 30 random sample
splits. For each partition, we choose the penalty term based on Post-LASSO RMSE, which we optimise with 10-fold
cross-validation. We apply one-step efficiency augmentation. We report the 95%-confidence interval based on the
bootstrap procedure described in section 4.6. *, **, *** mean statistically different from zero at the 10%, 5%, 1%
level, respectively. The differences and respective standard errors are reported in Table E.2 in Online Appendix E.
We report results for additional outcomes in Figures E.1, E.3, and E.5 in Online Appendix E.

Conversely, Figure 3 documents that individuals with some degree of education suffer
on average more from JSP than individuals with no degree. In general, we observe that the
negative lock-in effect is much less pronounced for unemployed persons with lesser
qualifications. This suggests that cream-skimming reduces the effectiveness of JSP
29

participation. These findings are consistent with the evaluation literature (e.g., Card, Kluve, and
Weber, 2015, van den Berg and van der Klaauw, 2006). Furthermore, the lock-in effects are
less negative for foreigners. One potential explanation is that foreigners have a relatively small
network for an informal job search. Therefore, the formal job search strategy might be relatively
successful for them. This suggests more foreigners should be assigned to JSPs. We find only
little heterogeneity by gender and age, which is in line with the findings of Vikström, Rosholm,
and Svarer (2013) for JSPs in Denmark. In our application, the effect heterogeneity by gender
is not statistically significant (see standard errors in Table E.2 in Online Appendix E).
Figure 4 reports effect heterogeneity of JSP participation on cumulated months employed
during the first six months after the start of participation by low and high values of caseworker
characteristics. The interpretation of Figure 4 corresponds to the interpretation of Figure 3. Although we find some significant differences, they are much less pronounced than for the
characteristics of unemployed persons. Most effect heterogeneity is observed by caseworkers’
own unemployment experience, but the difference is only 0.07 months (≈ 2 days). However,
the difference is statistically significant (see Table E.3 in Online Appendix E). Interestingly,
the cooperativeness of caseworkers has no statistically significant influence on the effectiveness
of JSP participation. We would have expected this characteristic to be a good predictor for
effect heterogeneity, because it might approximate different monitoring intensities of the
caseworker.

binary or below the median when the variable is non-binary. A high value is one when the variable is binary or not
below the median when the variable is non-binary. The CATEs are based on 30 random sample splits. For each
partition, we choose the penalty term based on Post-LASSO RMSE, which we optimise with 10-fold crossvalidation.. We apply one-step efficiency augmentation. We report the 95%-confidence interval based on the
bootstrap procedure described in section 4.6. *, **, *** mean statistically different from zero at the 10%, 5%, 1%
level, respectively. The differences and respective standard errors are reported in Table E.3 in Online Appendix E.
We report results for additional outcomes in Figures E.2, E.4, and E.6 in Online Appendix E. CW is the abbreviation
for caseworker.

5.5 Assignment rules for JSP

Next, we investigate the characteristics of unemployed persons with positive CATEs (Table 5).
The number of individuals with positive CATEs amounts to 674, which corresponds to 0.9%
of the unemployed persons in the sample. The first row of Table 5 reports the share of
unemployed persons assigned to a JSP by the sign of the CATEs. Only 8% of unemployed
31

persons with positive CATEs participate in a JSP, whereas 16% of the unemployed persons
with negative CATEs participate in a JSP. This points to the potential to improve the selection
of JSP participants. Additionally, Table 5 reports characteristics of unemployed persons with
positive and negative CATEs. The difference gives explicit advice on how assignment rules to
JSPs could be improved. For example, unemployed persons with a lower past income and lesser
past employment experience tend to have positive effects from participation. Participants with
lower degrees of education and foreigners seem to have a higher probability to profit from a
JSP. Strikingly, those unemployed persons who receive a low employability rating by their
caseworker are more likely to experience positive effects from a JSP than unemployed persons
with a medium or high rating. These results are further evidence that cream-skimming does not
improve JSP effectiveness.
Furthermore, we document the effectiveness of hypothetical statistical assignment rules
in Table 6. Statistical assignment rules have already received considerable attention in the
context of ALMPs (see, e.g., Bell and Orr, 2002, Caliendo, Hujer, and Thomsen, 2008, Frölich,
2008, Dehejia, 2005, O’Leary, Decker, and Wandner, 2002, among many others). However, we
are not aware of any application using machine learning methods to investigate assignment
rules for ALMP that systematically consider a high-dimensional covariate space.
For the proposed assignment rules, we keep the number of 12,712 (hypothetical) JSP
participants constant.16 Therefore, the proposed assignment rules are (almost) cost neutral compared to the existing assignment mechanism. However, we do not account for possible capacity
limits in regional training centres. We consider five hypothetical assignment rules: (i) random
allocation (called ‘random’ in the following), (ii) assignment of unemployed persons with the
highest CATEs (called ‘best case’ in the following), (iii) assignment of unemployed persons

16

We consider only participants on the common support. Therefore, the number of participants considered here is lower than
previous numbers.
32

with the lowest CATEs (called ‘worst case’ in the following), (iv) all unemployed persons with
at least one unemployment spell in the previous two years and unskilled plus a random selection
of the remaining unemployed persons with at least one unemployment spell in the previous two
years and no degree (called ‘previous unemployment’ in the following), and (v) all unemployed
with low employability rating by their caseworkers plus a random sample with medium employability rating (called ‘employability rating’ in the following). The random adding of
participants in assignment rules (iv) and (v) enables us to maintain the number of 12,712
participants. The ‘previous unemployment’ rule (iv) is inspired by the variables that show the
highest treatment effects in Table 3 and Figure 3. The ‘employability rating’ rule (v) assigns
unemployed persons to a JSP for whom the caseworkers give a low employability rating, as
opposed to cream-skimming, which assigns more unemployed persons with high employability
ratings.
Table 6 reports the average CATE under the different assignment rules. The average
CATE represents the hypothetical ATET under this treatment assignment. The ‘worst case’ and
‘best case’ assignment rules are the lower and upper bounds of the ATET (for a fixed number
of 12,712 participants). The difference between the lower and upper bounds are about 0.65
employment months (≈ 20 days). The ATET under random assignment is -0.78 months (≈ -24
days) employment during the first six months after the start of participation. This is the
benchmark assignment rule. Any imposed assignment rule should be better than random
assignment. However, the observed ATET is -0.82 months (≈ -25 days) employment during
the first six months after the start of the programme. It appears that the current assignment
mechanism is not better than a random assignment rule. In the context of Swiss ALMPs,
Lechner and Smith (2007) also find that the allocation by caseworkers performs no better than
random assignment. Furthermore, this is consistent with the findings of Bell and Orr (2002) and
Frölich (2008), who reject the idea that caseworkers allocate training programs efficiently in

33

the US and Sweden. Applying the optimal assignment rule ‘best case’ would reduce the
negative employment effects by 60% (= �(0.82 − 0.33)/0.82� ∙ 100%).

For the proposed assignment rule ‘previous employment’ the predicted ATET is -0.51

months (≈ -15 days) employment during the first six months after the start of participation. On
average, each participant has 9 days more employment under this assignment rule than under
random assignment. The negative employment effect of the current assignment mechanism
would be reduced by 38% (= �(0.82 − 0.51)/0.82� ∙ 100%). For the proposed assignment

rule ‘employability rating’ the predicted ATET is -0.61 months (≈ -18 days) employment dur-

ing the first six months after the start of participation. On average, each participant has 6 days
more employment under this assignment rule than under random assignment. The negative employment effect of the current assignment mechanism would be reduced by 21% (=
�(0.82 − 0.61)/0.82� ∙ 100%). These results are consistent with the argument that

assignments based on expected treatment effects rather than on predicted outcomes can be more
successful (Ascarza, 2016). However, the average effects remain negative and the programme

does not seem useful in improving employment opportunities of unemployed persons in
general. Nevertheless, the easy-to-implement assignment rules document the potential to
improve the current allocation mechanism.

5.6 Sensitivity checks

We perform large-scale sensitivity analyses to investigate the robustness of our results with
respect to the choice of the empirical method and the selection of tuning parameters. We replicate our estimates using different forms of efficiency augmentation (see Online Appendix F.2).
35

As an alternative variables selector, we consider the adaptive LASSO (Zou, 2006, see Online
Appendix F.3). Furthermore, we replicate the results with the Modified Outcome Method
(MOM) (Signorovitch, 2007, Zhang et al., 2012, see Online Appendix F.1) instead of the MCM.
Moreover, we employ radius-matching with bias adjustment (Lechner, Miquel, and Wunsch,
2011) to balance the observable covariates between the treatment and control group instead of
the IPW weights. This method shows good finite sample performance (Huber, Lechner, and
Wunsch, 2014). Furthermore, we compare the robustness of the main results with two different
sets of additional confounders (see Online Appendix F.5 for a description how we select the
additional confounders). Finally, we compare our results with the causal forest approach
(Wager and Athey, 2017, see Online Appendix F.4).
Table 7 reports the correlation between the CATEs for different empirical procedures. No
matter which specification we use, the correlation between the CATEs is always positive and
mostly above 0.5. The causal forest CATEs are less strongly correlated, but they still show a
decently strong positive association. Accordingly, our main findings are not sensitive to the
choice of empirical methods or selection of tuning parameters. We report additional sensitivity
checks in Online Appendix F.6. The estimation results are widely consistent across a variety of
different methodological choices and estimation procedures.

Correlations of CATEs for different methods of efficiency augmentation, variable selection, modifications and

balance the covariates. Only in procedure (9), we use radius-matching weights (Lechner Miquel, and Wunsch,
2011). See Online Appendix F for more details about the different procedures. In Online Appendix F.5, we describe
how we select additional confounders for procedures (11) and (12). Tables F.2-F.4 in Online Appendix F contain
the correlation between CATEs for the other outcomes.

Conclusion

We investigate recently developed machine learning methods to uncover systematically
treatment effect heterogeneity. We apply these methods to estimate the heterogeneous effects
of Swiss Job Search Programmes (JSPs) on different employment outcomes by allowing for a
high-dimensional set of variables potentially related to effect heterogeneity. We develop easyto-implement, efficiency-improving assignment rules for JSPs.
The employment effects of JSPs are negative during the first six months after the start of
participation and taper off afterwards. Parallel to this finding, we discover substantial effect
heterogeneity during the first six months after the start of participation, but not afterwards.
37

While an appropriate assignment rule could substantially decrease the negative lock-in effects,
the negative effects are unlikely to disappear completely. In particular, we find that unemployed
persons with low employment opportunities as well as foreigners experience less negative
effects. The data used contains the caseworkers’ subjective employability rating of their clients.
Using this measure alone for programme assignment, i.e. if caseworkers assign mainly
unemployed persons with a low employability rating, then negative lock-in effects are already
reduced by approximately 22%. The results remain consistent across a range of alternative
estimators and different implementation choices, showing the robustness of the findings.
There are still many open questions that are, however, beyond the scope of this paper. On
the substantive side, for example, it is not clear that the largely negative results will generalize
to other economic environments and other versions of JSPs implemented in other times and
other countries. On the methodological side, it must be acknowledged that despite the extensive
robustness checks, these methods are still very new and there could be practical problems not
yet uncovered. We investigate the heterogeneous employment effects of a particular programme
for different unemployed persons. The study abstracts from the questions about an optimal
programme for a particular unemployed person, which is also relevant because of the usually
rich programme structure of ALMPs. Such a modified goal raises several additional statistical
issues that may be addressed in future research.

Note:
We report unconditional means for all variables, standard deviations (S.D.) for all non-binary variables, and
standardised differences between participants and non-participants. Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) consider a
standardised difference of more than 20 as being ‘large’. We report the descriptive statistics of the outcome
variables in Table 1 of the main text. REA is the abbreviation for regional employment agency. For many variables
we include interactions with a dummy for French (× French speaking REA) and Italian (× Italian speaking REA)
speaking regional employment agencies. To account for categorical variables, we omit the dummies some
qualification degree, employability rating high, lives in small city, and German speaking regional employment
agencies.

Appendix C: Proof of Theorem 1

The following proof is based on the seminal contributions of Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983). To
proof the identification of CATEs, we use the definition (see Section 4.1 in the main text),
𝛾𝛾(𝑧𝑧) = 𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖1 − 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖0 �𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧� = 𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖1 �𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧� − �𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖0 �𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧�.

Then we apply the law of iterative expectations

𝛾𝛾(𝑧𝑧) = 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋|𝑍𝑍=𝑧𝑧 �𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖1 �𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 𝑥𝑥, 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧��𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧� − 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋|𝑍𝑍=𝑧𝑧 �𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖0 �𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 𝑥𝑥, 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧��𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧�.

When we condition on the confounders 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 , the potential outcomes are independent of the
treatment indicator 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 (Assumption 1),

𝛾𝛾(𝑧𝑧) = 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋|𝑍𝑍=𝑧𝑧 �𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖1 �𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 = 1, 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 𝑥𝑥, 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧��𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧�

− 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋|𝑍𝑍=𝑧𝑧 �𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖0 �𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 = 0, 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 𝑥𝑥, 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧��𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧�.

Conditional on the treatment status, the potential outcomes equal the observed outcome,
𝛾𝛾(𝑧𝑧) = 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋|𝑍𝑍=𝑧𝑧 [𝐸𝐸[𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 |𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 = 1, 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 𝑥𝑥, 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧]|𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧]

− 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋|𝑍𝑍=𝑧𝑧 [𝐸𝐸[𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 |𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 = 0, 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 𝑥𝑥, 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧]|𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 = 𝑧𝑧].

Appendix D: Propensity score and matching quality

Table D.1 reports the average marginal effects of the propensity score estimation to illustrate
selection into participation. Most of the significant coefficients confirm the observation that
unemployed with higher skills and labour market success are more likely to participate in the
program.
Table D.2 shows then that inverse probability weighting successfully balances the
covariates indicated by a maximum standardised difference of 2.44 and a mean standardised
difference of 0.7.

REA is the abbreviation for regional employment agency. For many variables we include interactions with a dummy

Figure D.1 plots the distribution of the propensity score by participation status. We enforce
common support by trimming observations below the 0.5 quantile the participants and above
the 99.5 quantile of non-participants. In total, we trim 6,700 observations (582 participants,
6,118 non-participants). This procedure shows good final sample performance in the study
Lechner and Strittmatter (2017).

The histogram has a binwidth of 0.005. The dashed lines show the lower and upper threshold of trimming.

Appendix F: Robustness checks

F.1 Modified Outcome Method (MOM)

In the baseline estimations, we rely on the MCM, because it offers the possibility of efficiency
augmentation described below. An alternative approach is the Modified Outcome Method
(MOM), which modifies the outcome instead of the covariates. This procedure was proposed
by Signorovich (2007) and extended to non-experimental studies by Zhang et al. (2012). We
apply the MOM by minimising the objective function

δˆ

 i 1 =j 1 

(

)

=
where Yi * wˆ ( Di , X i , Z i ) ⋅ Yi is the modified outcome.

F.2 Efficiency augmentation

Chen et al. (2017) propose two ways to account for the main effects, which might improve the
efficiency of the selection procedure. First, the one-step procedure includes the main effects in
the empirical model by solving

 i 1 =

(

)

This specification is strongly related to the approach of Imai and Ratkovic (2013), but they
consider only experimental research designs and propose a to use a combination of LASSO und
Support Vector Machines.
Second, the two-step procedure estimates a WOLS including only the main effects in
the first place. Afterwards, the estimated residuals û of this auxiliary regression are used as
regressand when selecting the interaction effects

 i 1 =

We consider the one-step procedure in the main specifications and show sensitivity checks with
the two-step procedure.

F.3 Adaptive LASSO

In the main results, we rely on the standard LASSO estimator. A potential disadvantage of this
estimator is the inability to penalize the coefficients differentially. The adaptive LASSO is an
alternative estimator that received a lot of attention in the literature (see Zou, 2006). One way
of specifying the adaptive LASSO in high-dimensional settings, is to minimise the objective
function



The Ridge estimator penalises the sum of squared coefficients instead of the sum of the absolute
coefficients (Hoerl and Kennard, 1970). Therefore, Ridge estimators shrink the coefficients to
zero, but they do not reach zero, unless the penalty parameter is infinity. Accordingly, Ridge
estimators do not select models. The penalty term of the adaptive LASSO in equation (1)
decreases with the absolute size of the Ridge coefficients. Accordingly, variables with small
Ridge coefficients have a larger penalty term in the adaptive LASSO. Zou (2006) shows that
the adaptive LASSO can achieve under appropriate assumptions the oracle property. The oracle
property implies that the adaptive LASSO selects the correct model at an asymptotically
67

appropriate rate, such that the selection step can be neglected. Wang and Leng (2007) discuss
the properties of the adaptive LASSO.

F.4 Causal forest

We implement the approach suggested by Wager and Athey (2017). It is based on combining
the causal tree approach by Athey and Imbens (2016) with the idea of random forests. In other
words, deep trees are build and effects are estimated within the resulting leaves. Tree building
is based on maximising estimated heterogeneity and using a randomly selected subset of
features at each possible sample split. Then, these individual predictions of the CATEs are
averaged over many bootstrap samples. So far, experience with these causal random forests are
limited which is the reason why we use them only for the robustness analysis.

F.5 Additional confounders

In our main specifications, we use the propensity score specification of Huber, Lechner, and
Mellace (2017). We consider two additional sets of confounding variables to check the
sensitivity of our results with respect to misspecification of the propensity score. First, we
estimate a LASSO model on the treatment equation
𝑁𝑁

𝑝𝑝

2

argmin ���𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 − 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 𝛼𝛼� − 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽̂ � � + 𝜆𝜆 ��𝛽𝛽̂𝑗𝑗 �,
�
�,𝛽𝛽
𝛼𝛼

𝑖𝑖=1

𝑗𝑗=1

where the confounders 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 are not penalised. We consider all variables of 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 with non-zero
LASSO coefficients 𝛽𝛽̂ as additional confounders (we call them ‘additional confounders 1’ in
the following). We denote the additional confounders 1 by 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖1 .

Second, we estimate a LASSO model on the outcome equation
𝑁𝑁

2

𝑝𝑝

argmin ���𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 − 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 𝛼𝛼� − 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖1 𝛽𝛽̂ − 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 𝛾𝛾�� � + 𝜆𝜆 ��𝛾𝛾�𝑗𝑗 �,
�
�,𝛽𝛽
𝛼𝛼

𝑖𝑖=1

68

𝑗𝑗=1

where the confounders 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 and 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖1 are not penalised. We consider all variables of 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 with non-

zero LASSO coefficients 𝛾𝛾� as additional confounders (we call them ‘additional confounders 2’

in the following). This procedure to select additional confounders is in the spirit of double
selection (see Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hansen, 2013).

F.6 Results of additional robustness checks

We estimate CATEs, 𝛾𝛾�𝑠𝑠 (𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 ), using different random sample splits. Table F.1 reports the average

correlations between CATEs obtained from the different random sample splits. The CATEs are
positively correlated between the different random sample splits. The positive correlations are
particularly high when we consider the employment outcome during the first six month after
start participation. After longer time periods, the positive correlations decrease, but remain
decently positive. This suggests that our results are not sensitive to a particular random sample
split. This finding is robust across 12 different estimation procedures we consider.
Tables F.2 to F.4 documents the correlations of aggregated CATEs, 𝛾𝛾̅ (𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 ), obtained

across different estimation procedures. These tables are similar to Table 7, but consider
different employment outcomes. The CATEs obtained from the alternative methods are highly
positively correlated, no matter which procedure we use. The smallest correlations are found
for the outcome cumulated employment during months 25 to 31 after the start of participation.
For this outcome the correlations are substantially lower. This is not surprising, because only
little heterogeneity is found for this outcome in general.
Table F.5 provides the descriptive statistics of all CATEs by different estimation
procedures and outcome variables. The means are close to the respective ATEs, which is
expected under the law of iterative expectations. This reassures that all estimation procedures
are able to replicate the semi-parametric IPW estimates.

69

Interestingly, the differences in the standard deviations indicate that some estimation
procedures detect more heterogeneity than others. We observe three striking patterns: First, the
two-step efficiency augmentation detects less heterogeneity than the one-step efficiency
augmentation or no efficiency augmentation. Second, the adaptive LASSO without efficiency
augmentation finds most effect heterogeneity. Third, the procedure with the weights obtained
from radius-matching tends to detect slightly less heterogeneity than the estimation procedures
using IPW weights. Table F.6 describes the number of selected variables in the 30 random
sample splits we consider. We observe large differences over different estimation procedure.
The adaptive LASSO selects substantially more variables than Post-LASSO estimators. This
could be an explanation why the adaptive LASSO detects most effect heterogeneity.
