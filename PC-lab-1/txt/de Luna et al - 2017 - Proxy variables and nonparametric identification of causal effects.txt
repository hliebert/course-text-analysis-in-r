abstract
Proxy variables are often used in linear regression models with the aim of removing potential confounding
bias. In this paper we formalise proxy variables within the potential outcomes framework, giving conditions under which it can be shown that causal effects are nonparametrically identified. We characterise
two types of proxy variables and give concrete examples where the proxy conditions introduced may hold
by design.

1. Introduction
Proxy variables are often used in empirical economics and
other empirical sciences as substitutes for unobserved confounders
when conducting observational studies. However, using substitute
variables does not necessarily reduce bias due to confounding to
zero and may even increase bias (Frost, 1979). Thus, we call herein
proxy variables only such substitute variables which yield identification of a causal effect of interest. Proxy variables have previously been defined in the literature in the context of linear models,
using for instance linear projection orthogonality conditions, see
Wooldridge (2010, pp. 67–72).
In this note we formalise proxy variables within the potential
outcomes framework (Imbens and Wooldridge, 2009), giving

conditions for which it can be shown that causal effects are
nonparametrically identified. This allows us to clarify the use of
proxy variables in a general context. Moreover, our approach also
allows us to characterise two types of proxy variables, one directly
related to the earlier definition mentioned above, and a new type of
proxy variable not previously considered in the literature. We also
give examples where the proxy conditions introduced may hold by
design.
2. Theory on proxy variables
We consider a study with aim to evaluate the effect of a binary
treatment T on an outcome Y . Let Y1 , Y0 be potential outcomes if
treated (T = 1) or not treated (T = 0) respectively, X a set of
observed pre-treatment covariates related to T and Y (observed
confounders), and U a set of unobserved pre-treatment covariates
also related to T and Y (unobserved confounders). We assume that
the observed outcome for any given unit is Y = TY1 + (1 −
T )Y0 , i.e. that consistency and the Stable Unit Treatment Value

Assumption, see Rubin (1980), hold. Letting A B | C denote that
A is conditionally independent of B given C (Dawid, 1979), the
following assumptions are used in the sequel.

Lemma 1 (Dawid, 1979). For any variables A, B, C and D, it follows
that: A B | C and A D | (B, C ) ⇐⇒ A (D, B) | C .

Assumption 1 (Unconfoundedness).

Proposition 1. If Assumptions 3(i), (iii), 5(i) hold, then τ t is
identified. Moreover, if Assumptions 3 and 5 hold, then both τ and
τ t are identified.

(i) T Y0 | (X , U ),
(ii) T Y1 | (X , U ).

Proof. By Lemma 1 we have that
T

U | (X , P ) and

Assumption 2 (Common Support).

T

Y0 | (U , X , P ) ⇐⇒ T

(i) Pr(T = 0 | X , U ) > 0,
(ii) Pr(T = 1 | X , U ) > 0.

The first part of the left-hand side of (1) holds by Assumption 3(iii).
The second part of the left-hand side of (1) holds by Assumption 3(i), using Lemma 1 to note that Y0 (T , P ) | (X , U ) ⇒
Y0 T | (U , X , P ). Since the left-hand side of (1) holds, it follows
that T (Y0 , U ) | (X , P ), which by Lemma 1 implies that T Y0 |
(X , P ). Thus, assuming further Assumption 5(i) yields identification of τ t . Similarly, if Assumption 3(ii) holds, then T Y1 | (X , P ).
Finally, if Assumptions 3 and 5 hold, then τ is identified. 

If in Assumptions 1 and 2 the set of unobserved covariates U
is empty, then the average causal effect τ = E (Y1 − Y0 ) and the
average causal effect on the treated τ t = E (Y1 − Y0 | T = 1) are
identified. While if U is empty only for Assumptions 1(i) and 2(i)
then only τ t is identified (Imbens and Wooldridge, 2009).
In observational studies, it may be the case that, although
U is not observed, we have observed variables which may act
as proxies for U . We now give conditions characterising proxy
variables useful for identification of average causal effects. Let P
denote a non-empty set of pre-treatment variables not included in
the covariate sets defined so far, P ̸⊆ {X , U }, and let U be nonempty such that Y0 T | X and/or Y1 T | X . A proxy variable
will then need to satisfy Y0 T | (X , P ) (and Y1 T | (X , P )) in
order for τ t (τ ) to be identified. A set of conditions describing useful
proxy properties for P are as follows.
Assumption 3 (Proxy Type I).
[irrelevance for outcome]
Y0 ⊥
⊥ (T , P ) | (X , U )
Y1 ⊥
⊥ (T , P ) | (X , U )

(i)
(ii)

[proxy property]
T ⊥
⊥ U | (X , P )

(iii)

This first type of proxy is similar in spirit to Wooldridge’s (2010)
definition of proxy variables. A proxy variable of Type I is an
irrelevant variable for explaining the potential outcomes given the
confounders (X , U ) (Assumption 3(i)–(ii)). A variable irrelevant for
the outcome is useful for identification (see Proposition 1 below)
when it makes U irrelevant for the treatment (Assumption 3(iii)).
We consider further another type of useful proxy variable,
which has up to our knowledge not been formalised in the
literature.

[irrelevance for treatment]

(i)
(ii)

T ⊥
⊥ (Y0 , P ) | (X , U )
T ⊥
⊥ (Y1 , P ) | (X , U )

[proxy property]

(iii)
(iv)

Y0 ⊥
⊥ U | (X , P )
Y1 ⊥
⊥ U | (X , P )

Thus, a proxy variable of Type II is such that it is irrelevant for
explaining the treatment assignment given the confounders (X , U )
(Assumption 4(i)–(ii)). A variable irrelevant for the treatment is
useful for identification (see Proposition 2 below) when it makes
U irrelevant for the outcome (Assumption 4(iii)–(iv)).
We will also need an extension of the common support
assumption for identification purposes.
Assumption 5 (Support on Proxy).

(i) Pr(T = 0 | X , P ) > 0,
(ii) Pr(T = 1 | X , P ) > 0.

(1)

Proposition 2. If Assumptions 4(i), (iii), 5(i) hold, then τ t is
identified. Moreover, if Assumptions 4 and 5 hold, then both τ and
τ t are identified.
Proof. The proof is similar to the proof of Proposition 1 and thus
omitted. 
3. Proxy variables by design
Proxy variables may be obtained by design and here we give
some examples. For the sake of simplicity, we focus on univariate
proxy variables P in the sequel.
3.1. Proxy Type I: outcome prediction
We characterise here a natural situation where a proxy of Type
I arises. Let
Y0 = h(X , U ) + εY ,

(2)

where εY is exogenous and h(X , U ) = E (Y0 | X , U ). Assume
that a prediction P of Y0 , made before the treatment assignment,
is available such that
P = h(X , U ) + εP ,

(3)

where εP (X , U , Y0 ) and E (εP ) = 0, i.e. the prediction is
unbiased. Consider further a study design where the treatment
assignment is a function of P and X as follows:
T ∗ = k (P , X ) + εT ,

Assumption 4 (Proxy Type II).

(Y0 , U ) | (X , P ).

(4)

for some function k(·), with εT exogenous and where Var(εT ) > 0.
Let the treatment assignment be such that T = 1 if T ∗ > 0 and
T = 0 otherwise. By exogeneity of εY , we have that Y0 (T , P ) |
(X , U ), i.e. Assumption 3(i) holds. Also, T U | (X , P ) by design,
i.e., Assumption 3(iii) is fulfilled. Suppose further that k(·) and εT
are chosen in such a way that Assumption 5(i) is fulfilled. Note that
the design error εT is necessary in order for Pr (T = 0 | X , P ) > 0.
Then τ t is identified by Proposition 1.
Example 1 (Outcome Prediction Proxy by Design). Consider the
situation where a treatment T is a social program for the
unemployed, whose effect on duration to employment, Y , we
want to evaluate. Suppose treatment is assigned by case workers
after interviews with eligible individuals. A set of individual and
labour market characteristics X are recorded at the time of the
interview. At that time, the case worker also makes a prediction P
of unemployment duration, would the individual not be assigned

154

to treatment (prediction of Y0 ). Then, arguably the case workers
will provide an unbiased prediction of Y0 , based on X and other
unobserved information U obtained at interview, i.e. such that
(2)–(3) hold. Furthermore, if we believe that P summarises all
information in U necessary to make the treatment assignment
decision, such that (4) holds, then P is a proxy of Type I. In practice,
the latter statement may be difficult to ensure by design and a
sensitivity analysis to Assumption 3(iii) may be useful.
3.2. Proxy Type II: lagged outcome
A Type II proxy variable may be available in a follow up setting
with three time periods, t = 0, 1, 2. Assume that the outcome
Y is observed at time t = 2. Further, let X and U be defined
at baseline (t = 0), with X potentially including the outcome
measured at t = 0. We also observe the outcome at t = 1, denoted
Y l , simultaneously as treatment T is assigned. Then, with such a
design it may be realistic to assume that
Y l = l(X , U ) + εL ,
T = 1 if T ∗ > 0 and T = 0 otherwise,

T ∗ = m(X , U ) + εT ,

for some functions l(·) and m(·) and where εL and εT are exogenous
error terms. Note that the fact that T and Y l are not related
conditional on X , U may be difficult to guarantee in practice. As
always, identification taking use of observational data depend on
the thematic question as well as the quality of data. Furthermore,
if we have
Y0 = q(X , Y l ) + εY ,

(5)

for some function q(·) and where the error term εY is exogenous,
then T (Y l , Y0 ) | (X , U ). Thus, by design P = Y l fulfils
Assumption 4(i), i.e. Yl is irrelevant for the treatment assignment
T . Moreover, Y0 U | (X , Y l ), i.e. Assumption 4(iii) also holds. The
validity of (5) should be investigated through a sensitivity analysis.
Finally, to guarantee that Assumption 5(i) holds here, a sufficient
condition is that Assumption 2 holds together with Pr (U | X , Y l )
> 0.
Example 2 (Lagged Outcome Proxy Design). An example of a lagged
outcome proxy design is given in Wooldridge (2010, Example 4.4),
where data on Michigan manufacturing firms is discussed with
the purpose to estimate the effect of job training grants (T ) on
firms’ productivity. A factor giving a measure of the latter is log
scrap rate (number of items out of 100 that must be scrapped)
−Y here. Wooldridge used years 1988 and 1987 for the purpose
of illustration, that is where T and outcome Y are measured in
1988, and argued that Y87 (log scrap rate in 1987) is a proxy of
Type I, i.e. in our framework such that T U | Y87 , where U
represents unobserved productivity factors. On the other hand, one
may arguably see Y87 as a proxy of Type II, i.e. such that Y0 U | Y87 .
However, any of these two proxy properties (I and II) constitutes a
strong assumption in this context. Proxy properties are untestable
and a sensitivity analysis should be carried out.
4. Parametric modelling
We aim here at relating under which circumstances classical
proxy conditions within linear models match the nonparametric
framework introduced here. We thus turn our attention to a linear
model where a variable P is a proxy variable of Type I. Suppose that

we have potential outcomes such that:
Y0 = α0 + β0′ X + γ U + ε0 ,

(6)

Y1 = α1 + β1 X + γ U + ε1 ,

(7)

′

where ε j , j = 0, 1, are exogenous variables with mean zero and
independent of each other. Let P be such that (3) holds. Then
Yj (P , T ) | (X , U ), j = 0, 1, and Assumption 3(i)–(ii) are fulfilled.
By Lemma 1 it follows from Assumption 3 that Yj P |
(X , U , T ), j = 0, 1. By consistency it follows that Y P | (X , U , T ).
This implies that E (Y | T , X , U , P ) = E (Y | T , X , U ), which is in
analogy with the redundancy condition in Wooldridge (2010, page
68). Furthermore, write
U = E (U | X , P ) + r ,

(8)

where E (U | X , P ) = θ0 +θ X +φ P and assume that r T | (X , P ).
Then, U T | (X , P ), i.e. P fulfils Assumption 3(iii). Given (8)
it also follows that L(U | 1, X , P , T ) = L(U | 1, X , P ), where
L(A | B) is the linear projection of A on B. This corresponds to
condition (4.26) in Wooldridge (2010, page 68). In summary, in
this situation, P is a proxy of Type I and a proxy as defined by
Wooldridge (2010). If Assumption 5 holds, then, by Proposition 1,
τ is identified. Note however that if γ in (6) and (7) are replaced
by γ0 and γ1 respectively, with γ0 ̸= γ1 , then identification is not
achieved through a linear model.

5. Discussion
Proxies are often used in empirical economics in order to
block unobserved confounding in observational studies. In this
paper we have given formal conditions under which proxies yield
nonparametric identification of average causal effects.
In many applications, an unobserved characteristic is replaced
by an observed variable believed to be a function of the former, in
the spirit of (3). For example, in Wooldridge (2010, Example 4.3),
ability is replaced by IQ. The key issue is whether such a variable
is a proxy as defined in this article, and in particular whether
Assumption 3(iii) holds or not. In the ability-IQ situation, it seems
reasonable to believe that IQ = fct (Ability) + εIQ . However,
assuming that T ∗ = fct (IQ ) + εT (in the sense of (4)) is not realistic
since one expects instead T ∗ = fct (Ability) + εT to hold. Thus, IQ is
not a proxy as defined herein, but rather a measure of ability with
error. Conditioning on the latter may yield bias; see Pearl (2010).
