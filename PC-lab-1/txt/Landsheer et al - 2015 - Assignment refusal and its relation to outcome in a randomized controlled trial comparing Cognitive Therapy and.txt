The effectiveness of Fluvoxamine was compared to that of Cognitive Therapy (CT) in a 12-week
randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 48 patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), who were
treatment-resistant to a previous behavior therapy (BT). A considerable amount of patients did not
comply with the assigned treatment and switched treatments. The aim of this study was to identify
patient characteristics predictive of assignment compliance and to study whether these characteristics
were related to outcome. A logistic model, based on psychological and social patient characteristics, in
addition to or in interaction with the assignment, was used for the explanation of compliance with
treatment assignment. Especially patients who have a higher score on the Yale–Brown Obsessive
Compulsive Scale (Y–BOCS) tend to comply with the effective Fluvoxamine treatment. The same set of
variables was related to both compliance and outcome of therapy received. Therefore, the logistic model
of compliance could be used to reduce the positive bias of As-Treated analysis (AT). The difference
between the results of Fluvoxamine and Cognitive Therapy remained statistically signiﬁcant after
correcting for the positive bias as the result of assignment refusal and after applying the assumption that
two drop-out patients needed imputation of lesser results.

1. Introduction
The effectiveness of Fluvoxamine was compared to Cognitive
Therapy (CT) in a recently published 12-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) in patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder
(OCD) who were treatment-resistant to 12 weeks of behavior
therapy (BT) (Van Balkom et al., 2012). A considerable amount of
these 48 patients (37.5%) refused to comply with their assignment.
These patients form a group to whom the treatment as-assigned
could not be applied and these patients deﬁed randomization and
control. The current study focused on patient characteristics that
were predictive for refusal of assignment and the relationship of
these characteristics with outcome of therapy received.
Refusal of an assigned treatment may be dependent on patient
characteristics that existed before randomization (Dunn et al., 2005)
and therefore are expected to be unrelated to a randomly assigned
treatment. Examples of such characteristics are personality factors,

ignorance concerning the beneﬁcial results of treatment, anxiety to
change as a consequence of treatment, or lack of motivation
(Leventhal and Cameron, 1987; Grifﬁth, 1990). Patients with a high
need for treatment and patients who have good insight into their
illness have more treatment readiness (Maher et al., 2012) and may
tend to comply more often. Patients living in a social environment
that provides some pressure towards health may also tend to comply
more often (Buchanan et al., 1996). When patient characteristics that
exist before therapy assignment would be the sole explanation of
assignment refusal, this refusal behavior can be considered as a
general characteristic and can be expected to occur equally in
randomized groups.
In the current trial we consider the additional assumption that
subjects' refusal to cooperate is also dependent on the treatment
assignment itself. The decision to refuse a treatment can be related
to a speciﬁc treatment (Leventhal and Cameron, 1987), based on a
lack of perception of beneﬁts, perceived negative effects, perceived
undesired side effects, or the perceived burden of the treatment
(Janz and Becker, 1984). Speciﬁcally, it is known that Selective
Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) such as Fluvoxamine have
side effects that may cause patients to stop treatment (Anderson et

J.A. Landsheer et al. / Psychiatry Research 226 (2015) 198–203

al., 2012). In the current study, compliance is deﬁned as compliance with the assignment. Furthermore, non-compliers in this
study have been assigned to the other treatment and all patients
have received similar treatment, either according to their primary
assignment or to their re-assignment. The basis for our model of
compliance with the assigned treatment is the assumption that
patients with stronger motivation are more inclined to comply
with the treatment offered. For several patient characteristics a
relationship with motivation to get better was hypothesized:
patients who have more severe symptoms may have a higher
motivation for treatment, patients with work are more motivated
to get better and keep their job. In addition, pre-treatment
depression and pre-trial treatment experiences are considered.
These personal characteristics are considered next to and in
interaction with treatment assignment. The assumption that we
tested was that patients with these characteristics tend to comply
more often and show a better result. Furthermore, our expectation
was that that the variables that were predictive of assignment
compliance were also related to the outcome of treatment
received.
2. Methods
2.1. Design and procedure
The dataset resulted from a RCT which was intended to compare the efﬁcacy of
Fluvoxamine versus CT as second-step treatments in a sample of subjects with a
main diagnosis of OCD and who were non-responsive to 12 weeks of behavior
therapy (BT) as a ﬁrst-step treatment (van Oppen et al., 2010). Patients with
obsessions only, suicidal intent, organic brain disease, past or present psychosis,
psychoactive substance use disorder, or severe borderline or antisocial personality
disorders were excluded. At baseline, all patients gave informed consent to be
randomized to either Fluvoxamine or CT for the second step. Patients who did not
respond to the ﬁrst step were informed of their status and randomized over two
conditions: Fluvoxamine (n¼ 26) or CT (n ¼22). Patients were individually randomly assigned to one of the treatments when they entered the study. The study
was accredited by the Ethics Committee of the VU University Medical Center and is
registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR1444; http://www.trialregister.nl/
trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=1444). Table 1 presents the ﬂow of the patients in
this trial. Complete data could be obtained from 45 subjects (93.75%) after
12 weeks.
A considerable number of patients (18) refused the assigned treatment directly
after assignment and before actual treatment had started. These patients are called
‘assignment refusers’. Most of these patients (16) could be successfully re-assigned
to the alternative treatment. Assignment refusers who were re-assigned to a
treatment received the same treatment as the patients who complied with the
ﬁrst assignment. A few (two) dropped out during the re-assigned treatment and
these patients are called drop-outs.
2.2. Measurements
Treatment effect was assessed by the difference score between postmeasurement and pre-measurement score on the Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y–BOCS; Goodman et al., 1989). Depression as a comorbid psychiatric
symptom was measured with the Montgomery–Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS;
Davidson et al., 1986). A higher score on the Y–BOCS pretest is considered as
indicative of symptoms that are more severe. The dichotomous variable ‘Treated

199

Before’ indicates whether the patient has been treated before the ﬁrst phase. The
dichotomous variable ‘Without Work’ is used as an indicator of the inability to
remain employed.

2.3. Analysis
2.3.1. Modeling assignment refusal
Assignment compliance (0 ¼refusal; 1 ¼compliance) is modeled using logistic
regression with the variables mentioned in Section 2.3 as predictors. To optimally
differentiate between the two treatment conditions, special attention was paid to
interaction effects. Furthermore, we analyzed whether the same person characteristics were also predictive of outcome using a linear model.

2.3.2. Effect estimation
Several conventional approaches are possible for the analysis of datasets with
patients who do not comply with their assigned treatment: Intent-to-Treat (ITT)
analysis, Per-Protocol analysis (PP) and As-Treated analysis (AT). Each of these
approaches has its drawbacks. ITT analysis includes all patients as assigned and is
partly counterfactual, because results are attributed to treatments that have not
been received. This may provide a limited estimate of the effect when noncomplying subjects remain untreated and dilute the results (Morden et al., 2011).
ITT estimates may be lower as more patients from the group that is assigned to the
effective treatment refuse their assignment, since these non-compliers actually do
not receive this effective treatment. This may result in a non-signiﬁcant estimation
(Heritier et al., 2003). PP analysis includes only those who entered the assigned
treatment. It therefore concerns groups that are reduced in number by removing
assignment refusers, resulting in differential attrition. Due to selectivity, the
reduced groups of patients who have followed protocol may have lost their
comparability (Morden et al., 2011). Implicitly, PP-analysis assumes that assignment refusal occurs completely at random and can therefore be ignored. This
assumption is rarely justiﬁed. AT-analysis uses all data as observed and is the most
factual of these three alternatives, because the results are analyzed of the
treatments that are actually received. AT-analysis often produces a higher effect
estimate when compared to the ITT result, but the AT groups cannot be considered
as randomized. Speciﬁcally patients who expect small or negative results may not
comply, while on the other hand patients who are more motivated or expect
beneﬁcial results may tend to comply more often. In that case, AT analysis may be
biased and provide an over-estimation of the effect found. In this paper, we focus
on the factual treatment received, hence on AT-analysis and we consider the
possibilities to reduce this bias.
Propensity score matching (PSM) is a statistical matching technique that
attempts to improve the comparability of insufﬁciently randomized treatment
groups with the use of variables that predict whether the treatment has been
received or not (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983). PSM is used to improve the
comparability of the differently treated groups (Little et al., 2009; Ten Have et al.,
2008; Joffe et al., 2003). When a raw AT estimate is considered as biased due to the
refusers' preference for one of the treatments, PSM may result in better comparable
groups and remove some of the bias that results from assignment refusal.
Alternatively, propensity scores can be used as a covariate to correct for the bias
of assignment refusal. There are some differences between the two approaches for
correction. A covariance analysis corrects the dependent variable, while matching
improves equality of the treated groups speciﬁcally for the predictors of assignment refusal. Matching on the propensity to comply makes no difference between
covariates that are highly or weakly predictive of the outcome variable (Rubin and
Thomas, 1996), while the use of co-variance analysis may remove the effect
partially or produce a spurious treatment effect (Miller and Chapman, 2001). A
simulation study demonstrated that PSM with small samples (as small as eight) can
perform as good as PSM with moderately large samples (200 or 500) in removing
covariate imbalances from observational designs (Kolar, 2013).
In this study, a logistic model was used to calculate the propensity of refusal or
compliance with the assigned treatment. The applied matching corrections are

intended to reduce the positive bias of AT-analysis and are called respectively
‘Matched As-Treated’ analysis and ‘As-Treated with propensity as covariate’.

2.3.3. Handling drop-outs and missing values
Another problem next to assignment refusal was the fact that two of the
patients who refused the assigned treatment did not ﬁnish the treatment in the reassigned condition. As a result, and in contrast to the other assignment refusers,
these two patients dropped out of the experiment and did not ﬁnish their
treatment. As a result, post-treatment measurements are unavailable for them. A
third patient who refused the assigned treatment and was re-assigned to the
alternative treatment did ﬁnish the treatment, but was not available for posttreatment measurements. The number of missing outcomes is relatively low in the
current study (three out of 48), but especially the results of the two patients who
broke off their treatment are not easily imputed. The outcome of the third dropout,
with solely unavailable post-measurements, is treated as missing at random (MAR).
However, for the ﬁrst two dropouts we explored the sensitivity of the results for
possible validity of the missing not at random (MNAR) assumption (Van Buuren,
2012). We considered the possibility that these missing values are informative
about the probability of missingness and are therefore non-ignorable. It is likely
that they dropped out because they were dissatisﬁed with the treatment offered.
The procedure for handling these missing data is based on the detailed
recommendations for multiple imputation of non-ignorable missing values from
Van Buuren (2012). Earlier, Rubin (2009) recommended the use of a straightforward, easily communicated model. We have used 10 imputations. To study the
possible overestimation, we used different scenarios: First, assuming that the
missing values are MAR, we imputed scores that are similar to those of comparable
patients. Second, we assumed that the drop-outs have a score less than that of
comparable patients (0.4 S.D. less improvement: a moderate negative effect size)
and lastly a worst case scenario: they have a change score that is considerably less
than that of comparable patients (0.8 S.D.: a large negative effect size). One S.D. of
the Y–BOCS difference score equals 6.96. These scenarios allow us to show the
impact of imputation on the effect estimates when it is assumed that the drop outs
would have considerable lesser results than comparable patients would. Most
importantly, it shows the sensitivity of the results for this assumption.

Fluvoxamine condition was based on 50% patients treated with
Fluvoxamine and 50% patients treated with CT (which proved to
be ineffective), while the effect of CT was based on 77% patients
treated with CT and 23% patients treated with Fluvoxamine. As a
result, the effect of Fluvoxamine is diluted. The results of the ATanalysis are considerably higher, but these were expected to be
over-estimated due to selective compliance.
3.2. Logistic model of assignment refusal
Various variables are predictive of compliance (Tables 2 and 3).
Treatment assignment itself is the strongest predictor of all:
patients who were assigned to CT complied more often (77%
versus 50%, P¼ 0.004). Sex and age were not relevant as predictors
(not shown in Table 3). Patients with higher pre-test Y–BOCS
scores complied more often. Patients without work complied less
often (40% versus 60%, P ¼0.027). Fifteen out of 16 patients who
refused their assignment had received previous treatment (94%),
while 24 out of 30 compliers had received previous treatment
(80%). As a result, previous treatment experience is a weak
predictor of assignment-refusal (P ¼0.066). As patients with strong
comorbid conditions had been excluded, comorbid depression
hardly had any effect. However, its interaction with treatment
assignment contributed signiﬁcantly to the prediction of compliance: patients with a higher score on MADRS were more often
inclined to comply with the Fluvoxamine condition (P¼ 0.01). This
was the only interaction effect with any impact.
The logistic model offers a reasonably strong prediction of
compliance: Nagelkerke's Pseudo-R2 ¼0.63. Using a threshold of
0.5, the correlation between prediction and compliance is Φ ¼0.69

3. Results
3.1. Basic results
Descriptive statistics can be found in Table 2. Although differences were small and insigniﬁcant in the groups of the primary
assignment, there are some differences apparent in Table 2. Most
notably: males (43%) are especially underrepresented in the
Fluvoxamine group (38%), but are as much inclined towards
refusal as females (50%); the two drop outs are young in comparison to the rest of the group; the mean Y–BOCS and the MADRS
pre-test scores are relatively high in the group of Fluvoxamine
compliers.
Raw, uncorrected outcome results of 45 patients with available
posttests are shown in Fig. 1. A ﬁrst analysis of these patients,
without imputation or bias correction, shows a meager effect
when applying ITT analysis, and a considerably stronger effect
when applying AT analysis (see Table 5, ﬁrst two rows). Because
patients treated with CT showed no effect, while strong effects
occurred in the Fluvoxamine condition, the ITT-analysis offers an
underestimation. Effectively, in the ITT analysis the outcome of the

(Pearson's Phi-coefﬁcient) for the complete group with seven
misclassiﬁcations out of 48, Φ ¼ 0.77 for the group assigned to
the Fluvoxamine condition with three misclassiﬁcations out of 26,
and Φ ¼0.42 for the group assigned to the CT condition with four
misclassiﬁcations out of 22.
3.3. Assignment refusal and outcome
Patients who refused the Fluvoxamine condition and were reassigned to CT, combined with the patients who were initially
assigned to the CT-condition, led to an over representation of
patients with lower scores on the Y–BOCS pretest in the CT
condition. Because we expected that both less compliance and
higher effects have common predictors, we checked which person
characteristics that predicted compliance are related to outcome.
Table 4 shows that except work and previous treatments all other
person characteristics are relevant predictors of outcome.
A large proportion of patients with Fluvoxamine as the primary
assignment refused treatment. At the same time, the Fluvoxamine
condition is the most effective. Especially patients with relatively
severe complaints complied with treatment with Fluvoxamine.
The CT-patients were also the patients with limited outcomes and
uncorrected AT-analysis therefore provides an over-estimation of
the differential causal effect, because the assignment refusers
showed a preference for the less effective treatment. The next
question we studied is whether we can reduce the bias that
resulted from assignment refusal by improving the match of both
AT groups.
3.4. Effect estimates
The matched AT effect is the effect difference between the
patients who actually have been treated with either Fluvoxamine
or CT, but matched on the characteristics that are predictive of
assignment refusal. First, all patients were matched on the variables that are predictive of assignment refusal. The group who
actually received the CT treatment was the largest and patients
from this group were discarded who were least like the patients
treated with Fluvoxamine. This matching resulted into two groups
equal in size (16).

201

Table 5 shows the results without imputation. The estimation
of the variance of the outcome variable that is explained by the
treatment conditions is indicated by η2. The uncorrected AT
analysis was applied to the 45 observed outcomes. It is executed
on two groups who are different because of assignment refusal
and this result shows the highest effect estimate. The Matched AT
was corrected for the propensity to comply and is therefore lower
than the raw AT estimate, as is the last analysis with the
propensity score as a covariate. The Matched-As-Treated analysis
(MAT), applied to two equal groups of 16 patients, reduces this
positive bias and this effect estimate gave 2% less explained
variance. The As-Treated analysis with propensity as a covariate
(AT.c) uses all available outcomes (45), but the covariate corrects
the outcomes. This also results in 14% explained variance.
3.5. Effect estimates and imputations
Table 6 shows the results of multiple imputations, using all data
of 48 patients for ITT, AT, MAT and AT.c analysis. Matching after
imputation resulted in two equal groups of 18 patients (MAT). The
latter analysis is limited by the patients who have been treated
with Fluvoxamine (18), while for the CT group the patients who
are most like those who received Fluvoxamine were selected. The
missing outcomes were imputed under fully conditional speciﬁcation (Van Buuren, 2012), using R 3.0.3 (R Development Core Team,
2014) and mice package 2.12 (Van Buuren and GroothuisOudshoorn, 2011). Under the MAR assumption, the imputed
results are similar to those of comparable patients. As the MNAR
assumption seems more feasible for the two drop-outs who did
not ﬁnish their treatment, MNAR imputations are applied with
results less than comparable patients, of respectively 0.4 S.D. and
0.8 S.D. of the dependent variable. This sensitivity analysis shows
that the results are susceptible to the conditions for imputation.
Even though there are only two missing values for which MNAR
imputation seems reasonable, these results show a considerable
difference in effect. Under the MAR assumption, the results are
slightly worse in comparison to the results without imputation,
with the ITT outcome as an exception. When the assumption of
MNAR is applied, it is noteworthy that the ITT-effects in fact
‘improve’ strongly when the imputed values represent a lesser
effect. This is an artifact (see Section 4). Overall, these few missing
data have some inﬂuence on the results. The worst case scenario of
0.8 S.D. pushes the results towards non-signiﬁcance.

4. Discussion
A large meta study (Hollis and Campbell, 1999) showed that
48% of trials dealt with a form of non-compliance, but only a very
small minority of studies (4%) explicitly stated that there were no
deviations from random allocation. This shows that noncompliance is a relevant and frequent problem. Our study shows
that assignment refusal can be partly predicted using patient
characteristics that exist before assignment and that these patient
characteristics are related to outcome. Furthermore, the assignment itself contributes considerably to the prediction of treatment
refusal. Araujo et al. (1996) reported that early compliance is a
strong and consistent predictor of outcome of exposure therapy.
Regretfully, recent relevant studies of assignment refusal or treatment non-adherence (van Dulmen et al., 2007) are scarce, as are
studies of its predictors and its inﬂuence on outcome of obsessive–
compulsive disorder treatment (Diniz and Fontenelle, 2013).
The results of our logistic model of assignment refusal indicate
that especially those with relatively severe complaints tend to
comply with treatment with Fluvoxamine. Prior to the second-step
treatment, all the therapy-resistant patients had at least one

Δ: estimate of the mean difference between the two treatments after the use of 10
imputations for the three missing values. λ: the amount of residual variance that
results from the imputations. η2: the estimate of variance that can be explained by
the treatment conditions. ITT: Intention-to-treat analysis; AT: As-Treated analysis;
MAT: Matched As-Treated analysis; AT.c: As-Treated with ‘propensity to comply’ as
covariate.

ineffective treatment, but most have experiences with various
treatments, including medication. Possibly, this speciﬁc group of
patients may have relatively well-informed expectations of therapy efﬁcacy. This may indicate that the refusers make a conscious
choice to decline Fluvoxamine treatment, possibly related to
expected side effects (Anderson et al., 2012). This is an interesting
hypothesis for further research, especially since patients with poor
insight and greater severity have also displayed higher medication
refusal in other studies (Santana et al., 2013).
The methodological challenge caused by drop-out is considerable, as it seems most likely that the drop-out mechanism is
missing not at random (MNAR). We therefore followed modern
guidelines (Gewandter et al., 2014), by making assumptions for
imputation explicit and using multiple imputation. Applying
various assumptions concerning lesser results for the drop-out
patients provides insight in the sensitivity of the results for dropout patients. This shows that when imputing moderate lesser
results, the matched AT-analysis shows a smaller effect that
remains signiﬁcant. Remarkably enough, the ITT analysis showed
results that became more signiﬁcant when lesser results are
assumed. This is because two of the missing values concern
patients who were assigned to the CT-condition but did not
comply; they were reassigned to the Fluvoxamine condition and
then dropped out. In the ITT analysis, their assumed deterioration
is allocated to the CT-condition and this leads to an increased
estimate when their imputed values are lessened. This illustrates
the counterfactual nature of ITT-analysis and underlines the
necessity of explicit use of assumptions for analysis and causal
inference. It is difﬁcult to say how the missing data can be imputed

best. The results of these patients are unknown and are hard to
estimate, given their unﬁnished treatment. The estimates differ,
dependent on the assumptions one is willing to make. In our view,
the MNAR assumption is more reasonable for missing data of
drop-out patients, in comparison to MAR.
A better outcome of treatment received can be partially predicted
with a higher score on the Y–BOCS pre-test. As a result, the effect
difference when comparing the two treatments is overestimated in
an uncorrected AT-analysis of the current trial: CT results are lower as
a result of the inﬂux of patients with lesser complaints, while
Fluvoxamine results are probably higher because of the perseverance
of patients with relative severe complaints. The propensity to comply
allowed us to reduce the positive bias because of assignment refusal.
Clearly, this is a better estimate than unmatched AT-analysis, as
assignment refusal inﬂuences outcome as well. Recently, statisticians
have developed various complex methods to improve on causal
estimates in trials with limited compliance. This has led to considerable debate (Rubin and Thomas, 1996; West and Thoemmes, 2010;
Bareinboim et al., 2014; Pearl, 2014). Clearly, the methods applied in
the current study design reduced the AT-estimate, which is considered to be an overestimation. Furthermore, the applied methods
allowed us to show that ITT-analysis is susceptible to assumptions
concerning the drop-outs. Nevertheless, it is difﬁcult to say whether
the applied methods are the most suitable. At this moment, rigorous
simulation studies of the various proposed methods are lacking and
it is difﬁcult to say which methods would be the best to apply.
Patient beliefs concerning the treatments offered, and expectations of both treatment efﬁcacy and side effects seem relevant.
Regretfully, this was not sufﬁciently measured in the current
study. Although all patients of the study gave informed consent
to get randomized to either Fluvoxamine or CT in the case of nonresponse after 12 weeks of BT, the sample of this second step RCT
concerned patients who showed a preference for non-medical
treatment. The results did provide insight into which patients
decided to follow the assigned treatment or not. The effect
difference of the two treatments remained statistically signiﬁcant
after correcting for the positive bias that resulted from assignment
refusal and assuming moderate worse results for the patients who
dropped out from this study.
