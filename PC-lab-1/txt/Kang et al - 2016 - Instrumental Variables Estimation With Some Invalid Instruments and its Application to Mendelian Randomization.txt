Instrumental Variables Estimation With Some Invalid
Instruments and its Application to Mendelian
Randomization
Hyunseung KANG, Anru ZHANG, T. Tony CAI, and Dylan S. SMALL
Instrumental variables have been widely used for estimating the causal effect between exposure and outcome. Conventional estimation
methods require complete knowledge about all the instruments’ validity; a valid instrument must not have a direct effect on the outcome
and not be related to unmeasured confounders. Often, this is impractical as highlighted by Mendelian randomization studies where genetic
markers are used as instruments and complete knowledge about instruments’ validity is equivalent to complete knowledge about the
involved genes’ functions. In this article, we propose a method for estimation of causal effects when this complete knowledge is absent.
It is shown that causal effects are identified and can be estimated as long as less than 50% of instruments are invalid, without knowing
which of the instruments are invalid. We also introduce conditions for identification when the 50% threshold is violated. A fast penalized
1 estimation method, called sisVIVE, is introduced for estimating the causal effect without knowing which instruments are valid, with
theoretical guarantees on its performance. The proposed method is demonstrated on simulated data and a real Mendelian randomization
study concerning the effect of body mass index(BMI) on health-related quality of life (HRQL) index. An R package sisVIVE is available on
CRAN. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

1. INTRODUCTION
Instrumental variables (IV) is a popular method for estimating the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome when there is
unmeasured confounding. Conventional IV estimation methods
require that the instruments are valid, or informally speaking,
that the instruments are (A1) related to the exposure (A2) have
no direct pathway to the outcome and (A3) are not related to
unmeasured variables that affect the exposure and the outcome
(see Figure 1 and Section 2 for a formal definition of valid IVs).
For example, Figure 1 is an illustration of the IV assumptions
and one potential violation of the IV assumptions (see, Hernán
and Robins 2006 for details on other possible violations). Here,
the IV is a genetic marker that is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) whose value is fixed at birth and the unmeasured
variables refer to variables that precede the assignment of the
genetic marker, such as population stratification (to be discussed
later). The challenge in IV estimation is to find valid instruments
that satisfy assumptions (A1)–(A3). Unfortunately, this is a difficult task, especially in the case of Mendelian randomization
(MR).
In MR, the goal is to estimate the causal effect of an exposure
on an outcome by using genetic markers, specifically SNPs,
as instruments (Davey Smith and Ebrahim 2003, 2004; Lawlor
et al. 2008; Wehby, Ohsfeldt, and Murray 2008). For example,
Timpson et al. (2005) studied the causal effect of C-reactive
protein (CRP), the exposure, on various metabolic outcomes,

such as body mass index (BMI) and cholesterol biomarkers
(e.g., tryglycerides), using four haplotypes constructed from
three SNPs (rs1800947, rs1130864, rs1205) as instruments. The
instruments have been previously associated with plasma CRP
levels, thereby agreeing with (A1). However, agreement with
(A2) and (A3) is less certain. As the authors of the study noted,
it is plausible that one or more of the genes that contain the
SNPs, rs1800947, rs1130864, and rs1205, may have multiple
functions, known as pleiotropy, where, in addition to changing
CRP levels (the exposure), the gene containing one of these
SNPs would change triglyceride levels or BMI (the outcome)
and (A2) would not hold. Indeed, recent work by Martı́nezCalleja et al. (2012) suggested that one of the instruments used,
rs1130864, is directly linked to BMI, one of the outcomes,
raising doubts about causal estimates when this SNP is assumed
to be a valid instrument.
As another example, Katan (1986), in one of the first discussions of MR, proposed to estimate the causal effect of serum
cholesterol level on cancer by using the apolipoprotein E polymorphism (APOE)’s effect on serum cholesterol levels. However, as Davey Smith and Ebrahim (2004) argued, the current
knowledge about the APOE gene and its multiple pleiotropic
effects on longevity, cholesterol biomarkers, and several other
variables, would invalidate the APOE gene as a valid instrument, specifically due to its violation of (A2), and make an IV
analysis based on it biased.
Both examples highlight a fundamental limitation with MR
studies. For one, pleiotropy and its impact on (A2) is a concern in most MR studies (Little and Khoury 2003; Davey Smith
and Ebrahim 2003, 2004; Thomas and Conti 2004; Brennan
2004; Lawlor et al. 2008). Lawlor et al. (2008) also list other
biological phenomena associated with genetic instruments such

Absence of arrows indicates no relationship. Numbers (A1), (A2), and
(A3) indicate different instrumental variables assumptions. In this example, the unmeasured variable refers to variables that precede the
assignment of the genetic marker, such as population stratification, and
the genetic marker is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) whose
value is fixed at birth. As such, the arrows from the unmeasured variable
originate from the unmeasured variable and the arrow from the genetic
marker goes from it to the outcome (A2) since the genetic marker is

as linkage disequilibrium and population stratification that may
violate (A2) and (A3). Unfortunately, verifying genetic instruments as valid IVs requires having complete knowledge of the
instruments’ biological function and pleiotropic effects. As both
examples highlight, the biological understanding of many genetic markers and their potential pleiotropic effects are typically
incomplete at the time of the study (Solovieff et al. 2013). In
the face of incomplete biological knowledge and possible instrument invalidity, can valid causal estimates be derived?
Previous work in IV estimation in the presence of possibly
invalid instruments is limited. Traditional instrumental variables
literature has stated that to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome when there are unmeasured confounders,
one needs to have at least one instrument that one knows is valid
(Wooldridge 2010). Andrews (1999) considered the invalid instrument case in the general context of generalized method of
moments (GMM) estimation common in econometrics and arrived at an identification result that is similar to our identification
result in Theorem 1. The author also proposed an estimation
strategy, called the moment selection criteria (MSC), to correctly select the valid instruments, which is similar to (8) in
Section 3.2. Unfortunately, as we discuss in Section 3.2, MSC
is computationally infeasible when the number of instruments
are large. Kolesár et al. (2011) considered the possibility of
identifying causal effects when all the instruments are invalid
because of direct effects on the outcome. The authors showed
that if the direct effects are orthogonal to the instruments’ effects on the treatment, then the causal effect can be identified.
Kolesár et al. (2011) describes conditions under which this orthogonality is plausible. But, for MR, this stringent structure on
the instruments would not hold in most cases as it would mean
that the pleiotropic effects of the IVs are orthogonal to the effects of the IVs on the treatment. Gautier and Tsybakov (2011)
analyzed instrumental variables regression in the presence of

133

possibly invalid instruments. However, for their procedure to
work, one must have a predefined set of known valid instruments. Finally, Mealli and Pacini (2013) explored how using an
auxiliary outcome can tighten bounds or provide identification
of the effect of a treatment on a primary outcome when there is
only one binary instrument that may violate (A2) by using an
using auxiliary outcome. However, their work is different to our
problem where we consider multiple candidate instruments.
Our article adds to the prior literature as follows. First, we
show that it is indeed possible to identify and estimate the causal
effect without a known predefined set of valid instruments. In
particular, under a weaker condition where the proportion of
invalid instruments is strictly less than 50% of the total instruments, we show that identification and estimation is possible.
For example, given four possible haplotypes/instruments in the
previous example by Timpson et al. (2005), estimation of the
causal effect of CRP on metabolic phenotypes is still possible
if no more than one instrument is invalid, without knowing exactly which of the four is invalid. We also show conditions for
identification when the 50% threshold may not hold.
Second, we develop a fast 1 estimation procedure to estimate
the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome in the presence
of possibly invalid instruments. The procedure has provable theoretical guarantees on estimation performance and is computationally as fast as ordinary least squares (OLS). The procedure is
implemented and available on CRAN as an R package sisVIVE,
which stands for some invalid some valid IV estimator.
Third, we conduct a simulation study that compares our
method to two-stage least squares (TSLS), the most popular
estimation procedure in IV estimation. We show that our procedure dominates TSLS when the instruments may be invalid.
We also conduct a real MR study concerning the effect of BMI
on health-related quality of life (HRQL) measure using our new
method.
2. CAUSAL MODEL AND INSTRUMENTAL
VARIABLES
2.1 Notation
To define valid instruments, the potential outcomes approach
(Neyman 1923; Rubin 1974) for instruments laid out in Holland
(1988) is used. For each individual i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, let Yi(d,z) ∈ R
be the potential outcome if the individual were to have exposure
d ∈ R and instruments z ∈ RL . Let Di(z) ∈ R be the potential
exposure if the individual had instruments z ∈ RL . For each
individual, only one possible realization of Yi(d,z) and Di(z) is observed, denoted as Yi and Di , respectively, based on his observed
instrument values Zi. ∈ RL and exposure Di . In total, n sets of
outcome, exposure, and instruments, denoted as (Yi , Di , Zi. ),
are observed in an iid fashion.
We denote Y = (Y1 , . . . , Yn ) to be an n-dimensional vector of
observed outcomes, D = (D1 , . . . , Dn ) to be an n-dimensional
vector of observed exposures, and Z to be a n by L matrix of
instruments where row i consists of Zi. .
For any vector α ∈ RL , let αj denote the jth element of α.
Let α1 , α2 , and α∞ be the usual 1, 2 and ∞-norms,
respectively. Let α0 denote the 0-norm, that is the number of
nonzero elements in α. The support of α, denoted as supp(α) ⊆
{1, . . . , L}, is defined as the set containing the nonzero elements

134

Journal of the American Statistical Association, March 2016

of the vector α, that is, j ∈ supp(α) if and only if αj = 0. A
vector α is called s-sparse if it has no more than s nonzero
entries. Also, for a vector α ∈ RL and set A ⊆ {1, . . . , L}, we
denote α A ∈ RL to be the vector where all the elements except
whose indices are in A are zero.
For any n by L matrix M ∈ Rn×L , we denote the (i, j ) element
of matrix M as Mij , the ith row as Mi. , and the jth column
as M.j . Let MT be the transpose of M. Let PM be the n by
n orthogonal projection matrix onto the column space of M,
specifically PM = M(MT M)−1 MT ; it is assumed that MT M
has a proper inverse, unless otherwise noted. Let PM⊥ be the
residual projection matrix, specifically PM⊥ = I − PM where I
is an n by n identity matrix.
For any sets A ⊆ {1, . . . , L}, we denote AC to be the complement of set A. Also, we denote |A| to be the cardinality of
set A.
2.2 Model
We consider the Additive LInear, Constant Effects (ALICE)
model of Holland (1988) and extend it to allow for multiple valid
and possibly invalid instruments as in Small (2007). Let d  , d ∈
R be possible values of the exposure and z , z ∈ RL be possible
values of the instruments. Let i = Yi(0,0) − E[Yi(0,0) |Zi. ] and
the collection of i be denoted as  = (1 , . . . , n ). Suppose we
have the following potential outcomes model for the outcome




Yi(d ,z ) − Yi(d,z) = (z − z)T φ ∗ + (d  − d)β ∗
E(Yi(0,0) |Zi. )

=

ZTi. ψ ∗ ,

(1)
(2)

where φ ∗ , ψ ∗ ∈ RL , and β ∗ ∈ R are unknown parameters. In
Equation (1), the parameter β ∗ represents the causal parameter
of interest, the causal effect on the outcome of changing the
exposure by one unit. Also in Equation (1), the parameter φ ∗
represents the direct effect of the instruments on the outcome;
changing instruments from z to z results in a direct effect on
the outcome of (z − z)T φ ∗ . In Equation (2), the parameter ψ ∗
represents the confounders that affect the instrument and the
outcome. In particular, without any confounders, there should
not be any relationship between the instruments Zi. and the potential outcome Yi(0,0) . Instead, in Equation (2), they are related
via ψ ∗ .
Let α ∗ = φ ∗ + ψ ∗ . When we combine Equations (1) and (2)
along with the definition of i , we have the observed data model
Yi = ZTi. α ∗ + Di β ∗ + i ,

E(i |Zi. ) = 0.

(3)

We make the following remarks regarding the model (3). First,
the model can include exogenous measured covariates, say Xi. ∈
Rp which may include the intercept term, and we can replace
the variables Yi , Di , and Zi. with the residuals after regressing
them on X (e.g., replace Y by (I − PX )Y) where X is the n by
p matrix of covariates (Wang and Zivot 1998). The results in
this article will hold generally when working with such data
that is transformed by regressing out the effect of X. In the
same spirit, the model can be extended to nonlinear models by
including appropriate basis transformations of Zi. . However, for
simplicity of exposition, we will focus on a model without any
measured covariates or nonlinear terms. We will also assume
that Y, D, and the columns of Z are centered, which can also

result from a residual transformation with X containing only the
intercept term.
Second, following Heckman and Robb (1985), Björklund and
Moffitt (1987), and Small (2007), we can incorporate heterogeneous effects as follows. Suppose, instead of Equation (1), the
potential outcomes model for the outcome is




Yi(d ,z ) − Yi(d,z) = (z − z)T φ ∗ + (d  − d)βi∗ ,

(4)

where β ∗ = E(βi∗ ) is the average effect of the exposure for
everyone in the population. Then, the observed data model can
be derived from (4) as follows
Yi = ZTi. α ∗ + Di β ∗ + (βi∗ − β ∗ )Di + i ,

E(i |Zi. ) = 0.
(5)

If (βi∗ − β ∗ ) is independent of Di given Zi. , the heterogeneous
model in (5) is identical to model (3) and our result for Theorem
1 in Section 3.1 hold. Also, as Small (2007) notes in page 1055,
the assumption that (βi∗ − β ∗ ) is independent of Di given Zi.
is equivalent to that “units do not select their treatment levels
Di given Zi. based on the gains they would experience from
treatment Di given Zi. .” If this assumption is violated, different
groups of people will have different treatment effects, which in
turn would lead to possibly nonzero α ∗ (see, Angrist and Imbens
1995 and Small 2007 for details). For simplicity of exposition,
we’ll focus on a model with constant linear effect β ∗ .
2.3 Definition of Valid Instruments
Based on the observed model in (3), the parameter α ∗ combines both the direct effect, represented by φ ∗ , and the effect of
confounders on the Zi. and Yi(0,0) relationship, represented by
ψ ∗ . If there is no direct effect and no effect of the confounders,
then α ∗ = 0. Hence, the value of α ∗ captures the notion of valid
and invalid instruments. The definition below formalizes this
idea:
Definition 1. Suppose we have the models in (1)–(3) with L
instruments. We say instrument j ∈ {1, . . . , L} is valid if αj∗ = 0
and invalid if αj∗ = 0.
Definition 1 distinguishes valid and invalid instruments based
on supp(α ∗ ), the support of α ∗ . If instrument j = 1, . . . , L is not
in the support, it is valid. If the instrument is in the support of α ∗ ,
it is invalid. Consequently, not knowing which instruments are
valid and invalid directly translates to not knowing the support
of α ∗ in model (3).
In the case of only one instrument (i.e., L = 1), Definition
1 of a valid instrument matches with the informal definition
(A2) and (A3) in the Introduction and the formal definition in
Holland (1988). Specifically, the notion of exclusion restriction

(A2), Yi(d,z) = Yi(d,z ) for all z, z ∈ R is equivalent to the parameter φ ∗ in Equation (1) being zero. Also, the assumption of no
unmeasured confounding of the IV-outcome relationship (A3)
where Yi(d,z) and Di(z) are independent of Zi for all d, z ∈ R, is
encoded by ψ ∗ in (2) being zero. Hence, φ ∗ = ψ ∗ = 0, which
implies α ∗ = 0 and a valid IV in Holland (1988) is also a valid
IV in our definition. Also, for one instrument, our model and
definition is a special case of the definition of valid instrument discussed in Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin (1996) where

Kang et al.: Instrumental Variables Estimation with Some Invalid Instruments and its Application to Mendelian Randomization

our model assumes an additive, linear, and constant treatment
effect β ∗ .
For more than one instruments (i.e., L > 1), our model (1)–(3)
and definition of valid IVs can be viewed as a generalization of
Holland (1988). It is important to note that in this generalization, Definition 1 defines the validity of an instrument j in the
context of the set of instruments {1, . . . , L} being considered.
Specifically, an instrument j could be valid in the context of
the set {1, . . . , L} (i.e., αj∗ = 0), but invalid if considered alone
because Z.j may be associated with or causally affect another
IV Z.j  , j = j  where αj∗ = 0.
3. ESTIMATION OF CAUSAL EFFECT
3.1 Identifiability of Model
We first address whether the model in Equation (3) is identifiable, that is whether we can estimate the unknown parameters if
we were given infinite data, even without any knowledge about
which instruments are valid and invalid. We begin by making
the assumptions.
(a) E(ZT Z) is full rank.
(b) For E(ZT D) = E(ZT Z)γ ∗ , the components of γ ∗ are all
not equal to zero, that is, γj∗ = 0 for j = 1, . . . , L.
Assumption (a) states that the matrix of instruments Z is
full rank, a common assumption in the instrumental variables
literature (Wooldridge 2010). Assumption (b) states that the instruments are associated with the exposure, akin to assumption
(A1), that the instruments are relevant to the exposure; note
that there does not need to be a causal relationship between the
instrument Z and the exposure D, just an association (Hernán
and Robins 2006; Didelez and Sheehan 2007; Glymour, Tchetgen, and Robins 2012). As one reviewer remarked, assumption
(b) requires that all L instruments are related to the exposure,
γj∗ = 0 for all j. If we have instruments that are not relevant to
the exposure, γj∗ = 0, we can exclude them from further analysis and concentrate only on those instruments that affect the
exposure.
Now, the model in (3) implies the following moment
condition
E(ZT (Y − Zα ∗ − Dβ ∗ )) = 0.

(6)

Suppose the assumptions (a) and (b) hold. Then, the moment
equation in Equation (6) simplifies to
∗ = α∗ + γ ∗β ∗

(7)

where  ∗ = E(ZT Z)−1 E(ZT Y). Since both  ∗ and γ ∗ , defined
by (b), can be identified by their moments based on observed
data E(ZT Z)−1 E(ZT Y) and E(ZT Z)−1 E(ZT D), respectively,
α ∗ and β ∗ are identified if we can find a bijective mapping
between α ∗ , β ∗ , and  ∗ , γ ∗ , that is, a unique solution α ∗ , β ∗
given  ∗ , γ ∗ .
If we know exactly which instruments are invalid A∗ =
supp(α ∗ ) = {j : αj∗ = 0} and hence, know the set of valid instruments (A∗ )C = {j : αj∗ = 0}, Equation (7) becomes
α (A∗ )C + γ ∗(A∗ )C β ∗ = γ ∗(A∗ )C β ∗ =

∗
(A∗ )C .

There is a unique β ∗ so long as |(A∗ )C | > 0, or there is at least
one known valid instrument. This is a special case of the classic

135

identification result for linear simultaneous equation models
(Koopmans, Rubin, and Leipnik 1950).
If we know that there is a valid instrument, but are not sure
of the identity of the valid instrument(s), then a unique solution
to (7) and hence, identification, is not guaranteed. For example, let there be four instruments, L = 4 with γ ∗ = (1, 2, 3, 4)
and  ∗ = (1, 2, 3, 8). Then, depending on the set of valid instruments (A∗ )C , which is unknown, we have two different β ∗
that satisfy Equation (7). If the set of valid instruments (A∗ )C
∗
∗
is (A∗ )C = {1, 2, 3}, we have γ ∗(A∗ )C β ∗ = (A
= 1.
∗ )C and β
∗ C
∗
However, if the set of valid instruments is (A ) = {4}, β = 2.
Without knowing exactly which (A∗ )C is the true set of valid
instruments, we cannot choose between the two β ∗ ’s and hence,
there is not a unique solution to (7).
But, suppose we impose constraints on A∗ . Specifically, suppose the number of invalid instruments, s = |A∗ |, has to be
less than some number U, s < U , without knowing which instruments are invalid or knowing exactly the number of invalid
instruments. For example, geneticists may have a rough idea on
the maximum number of invalid instruments, U, but not know
exactly the number of invalid instruments nor do they know
exactly which instruments are invalid. Note that this condition
of knowing the maximum number of invalid instruments is a
much weaker requirement than what is traditionally required
in IV and MR literature where one must know exactly which
instruments are invalid, that is, know exactly the set A∗ ; here,
we only need an upper bound on the cardinality of A∗ . Under
the weaker condition s < U , a unique solution to (7) can exist
and this is stated in Theorem 1.
Theorem 1 (Uniqueness of solution). Suppose we assume
assumptions (a) and (b) and the modeling assumption (3). Let
s ∈ {0, 1, . . . , L} with s < U where U = 1, . . . , L. Consider all
sets Cm ⊆ {1, . . . , L}, m = 1, . . . , M of size |Cm | = L − U +
1 with the property
γj∗ qm =

∗
j

j ∈ Cm

where qm is a constant. There is a unique solution α ∗ and β ∗ to
(7) if and only if qm = qm for all m, m ∈ {1, . . . , M}.
To understand Theorem 1, note that if the valid instruments
are those in the set Cm , then the causal effect β ∗ = qm . Theorem
1 says that β ∗ is identified as long as there are not two subsets
of the instruments of cardinality L − U + 1 that give internally
consistent estimates of β ∗ (i.e., all instruments in each subset
give the same estimate of β ∗ ), but are externally inconsistent
(i.e., the estimates of β ∗ from the two subsets are different). We
call the property in Theorem 1 that there is a unique solution
to α ∗ and β ∗ to (7) if and only if qm = qm for all m, m ∈
{1, . . . , M} the consistency criterion. We thank Jack Bowden
for his insight and suggestions on terminology for interpreting
Theorem 1.
As an example of applying Theorem 1, consider our numerical
example above with γ ∗ = (1, 2, 3, 4) and  ∗ = (1, 2, 3, 8) and
U = 3. Then, by Theorem 1 we have 3 sets C1 = {1, 2}, C2 =
{1, 3}, C3 = {2, 3} with q1 = q2 = q3 = 1. Hence, γ ∗ and  ∗
satisfy the consistency criterion of Theorem 1 and we have a
unique solution α ∗ and β ∗ to (7). In contrast, if γ ∗ = (1, 2, 3, 4)
and  ∗ = (1, 2, 6, 8), we would have two sets C1 = {1, 2}, C2 =

136

Journal of the American Statistical Association, March 2016

{3, 4} with q1 = 1 and q2 = 2, respectively. These γ ∗ and  ∗
do not satisfy the consistency criterion of Theorem 1 because
q1 = q2 and there are no unique solutions α ∗ and β ∗ to (7).
Further discussion of this particular example is discussed in
supplementary materials along with discussion of the implications of Theorem 1 when the additional linearity and normality assumptions of the classical linear simultaneous/structural
equation model (Koopmans, Rubin, and Leipnik 1950) are
considered.
Checking the consistency criterion can be computationally
L
)
difficult, especially if U is large; it requires looking at ( L−U
+1
possible subsets of {1, . . . , L} and the constants qm associated
with  ∗ and γ ∗ . Corollary 1 says that the consistency criterion
is automatically satisfied if U ≤ L/2 (i.e., if 50% of the total
candidate of L instruments are invalid) regardless of the values
of γ ∗ and  ∗ .
Corollary 1. If U ≤ L/2, there is always a unique solution
to (7)
In addition to the computational benefits, compared to Theorem 1, Corollary 1 is simpler to interpret. For example, for a
geneticist, without knowing the entire biology of genetic instruments, specifically knowing which instruments are valid and
invalid, as long as the number of invalid instruments is less than
50% of the total instruments, then the geneticist can rest assured
that the parameters can always be identified. If this is not the
case, the geneticist can always check the consistency criterion
stated in Theorem 1.
We would like to mention two final points about Theorem 1.
First, Theorem 1 is a statement about uniqueness of solutions for
the parameters α ∗ , and β ∗ in Equation (7). A natural question
to ask is whether the uniqueness is guaranteed for just β ∗ , the
causal effect of interest, at the expense of nonuniqueness of α ∗ .
In the proof of Theorem 1, we show that this cannot be the case.
Specifically, regardless of the condition on s, the parameter β ∗ is
a unique solution to (7) if and only if the parameter α ∗ is a unique
solution to (7). Second, Theorem 1 supposes the existences of
the sets Cm and proceeds to compare their corresponding qm .
However, one may ask whether these sets Cm even exist in the
first place. In the proof of Theorem 1, we provide a rigorous
argument that, indeed, under model (3) and s < U , at least one
set Cm has to exist.
3.2 Estimation of the Causal Effect of Exposure
on Outcome
Given the model (3) and s < U , Theorem 1 lays out the sufficient and necessary condition for finding a unique solution to
the moment Equation (6). Specifically, if the model is identified,
the moment Equation (6) is zero at exactly one value, the true
value of α ∗ and β ∗ . Naturally then, a method to estimate the
one true value is to find the values of α ∗ and β ∗ that minimize
(6) subject to the parameter constraint that s < U . Formally, we
can write this estimation strategy as
1
argmin PZ (Y − Zα − Dβ)22 ,
2
α,β

s.t. ||α||0 < U,

(8)

where ||α||0 is the number of nonzero entries of α and by Definition 1, s = ||α||0 . Equation (8) is similar to the moment selection

criterion (MSC) in Andrews (1999). However, both the moment
selection criterion in Andrews (1999) and (8) are computationally infeasible in the sense that both require going through all
subsets of size less than U and this type of problem has been
shown to be NP-hard (Natarajan 1995). Instead, a computationally tractable version of estimation strategies like (8) has been
proposed in the literature using a convex surrogate of the 0 norm
(Candes and Tao 2005; Tropp 2006; Donoho 2006). Specifically,
the computationally feasible version of the estimation strategy
in (8) can be written as
1
argmin PZ (Y − Zα − Dβ)22 ,
2
α,β

s.t. ||α||1 ≤ t,

(9)

where the 0 norm is replaced by the convex norm 1 and U
is replaced by a user-specified tuning parameter t > 0. In this
article, we propose the equivalent Lagrangian form as our estimator of the causal effect, called some invalid some valid IV
estimator, or sisVIVE, as follows
1
(α̂ λ , β̂λ ) ∈ argmin PZ (Y − Zα − Dβ)22 + λα1 (10)
2
α,β
for some tuning parameter λ > 0 where λ corresponds to t in (9).
If λ = 0 in (10), then (10) is the popular two stage least squares
(TSLS) estimator, which is equivalent to the GMM estimator
when the  are assumed to be homoscedastic (Hansen 1982).
Hence, sisVIVE can be viewed as a generalization of TSLS or
GMM.
sisVIVE also bears some resemblance to the traditional 1
penalization procedure, in particular the Lasso (Tibshirani 1996)
or the recent 1 penalty procedures in IV estimation by Gautier
and Tsybakov (2011) and Belloni et al. (2012). However, there
are a few important differences. First, with regards to traditional
Lasso and the procedure proposed by Gautier and Tsybakov
(2011), our procedure in (10) only penalizes α ∗ . The estimator
(10) does not penalize β ∗ , the causal effect of the exposure
on the outcome, because the causal effect may be far from
zero. In contrast, the prior works we mentioned penalize all
the parameters in the model. Second, the traditional Lasso only
considers regression with all exogenous regressors, which are
regressors that are assumed to be independent of the error term
or assumed to be fixed. The regressors in our model (3) are
not all exogenous; specifically, model (3) contains one random
endogenous variable, Di , which is dependent on the error term.
Third, Gautier and Tsybakov (2011) and Belloni et al. (2012)
assume that either all the L instruments are valid or we know
exactly which subset of them are valid. In contrast, our procedure
does not assume this.
Finally, a careful reader may have recognized that there may
be multiple minimizers to the Equation (10), specifically β̂λ ,
because ||α||1 is not strictly convex and hence, we use the set
notation instead of the equality sign in (10). This might seem
to be a concern as there are multiple estimates of β ∗ . However,
as we will show in Section 3.4, all minimizers of (10) are close
to the true values β ∗ . Also, if the entries of the matrix PD̂⊥ Z
where D̂ = PZ D (i.e., the predicted value of the exposure given
the instruments) are drawn from a continuous distribution, then
the solution to (10) is unique (Tibshirani 2013).
Without loss of generality, we assume that the columns of Z
are scaled to unit length. This allows all L instruments to have

identical units so no columns of Z gets unfairly penalized by
the penalty term in (10) simply due to their original units.

samples using the RIP conditions. Note that this characterizes
all the minimizers β̂λ from sisVIVE in (10).

Like many penalization procedures, the choice of the tuning
parameter λ affects the performance of the estimation procedure
and this is certainly the case with sisVIVE. High values of λ
force heavy penalization on α, which will put most elements of
α̂ λ to zero and most instruments will be estimated as valid instruments. In contrast, low values of λ will put few elements of
α̂ λ to zero and most instruments will be estimated as invalid instruments. In short, the optimal choice of λ depends on knowing
the exact number of invalid and valid instruments, something
not implied by the condition s < U .
In practice, cross-validation is a popular data-driven method
to choose λ. In the same spirit, we use a K-fold cross-validation
where we minimize the estimating equation ||PZ (Y − Zα −
Dβ)||2 instead of the predictive error ||(Y − Zα − Dβ)||2 . We
minimize the estimating equation instead of the predictive error
since the parameter of interest is the causal effect β ∗ that sets the
expected value of the estimating equation to zero (see Equation
(6), Sections 3.1 and 3.2). We use the “one standard error” rule
used in most cross-validation procedures (Hastie et al. 2009) and
choose the smallest λ that is no more than one standard error
above the minimum of the estimating equation. In Section 4, we
discuss the performance of β̂λcv , where λcv is the cross-validated
λ based on the estimating equation through various simulation
studies. Also, in the supplementary materials, we discuss another method of choosing λ, in particular, choosing λ based on
the theoretical guidance from Theorem 2 and Corollary 2. In
short, the supplementary materials show that for better estimation performance of β̂λ , it is important not to incorrectly set
invalid IVs to be valid (i.e., let α̂j to be zero when the true αj∗ is
not zero), while the reverse is not as important. This observation
argues for choosing λ that tends to set relatively few elements
of α̂ λ to be zero and in the supplementary materials, we demonstrate that cross-validation achieves this goal in a wide variety
of settings.
3.4 Estimation Performance
How well does sisVIVE estimate the causal effect β ∗ ? To
analyze the performance of sisVIVE, we first introduce some
basic notations and definitions.
Definition 2. For any matrix M, the upper and lower restricted
isometry property (RIP) constants of order k, denoted as δk+ (M)
and δk− (M), respectively, are the smallest δk+ (M) and largest
δk− (M) such that
δk− (M)α22 ≤ Mα22 ≤ δk+ (M)α22

(11)

holds for all k-sparse vectors α.
RIP conditions have been widely used in the literature on
compressed sensing and high-dimensional linear regression. See
Cai and Zhang (2013) and the references therein. The following theorem characterizes the performance of sisVIVE in finite

−

−
+
Condition (12) includes the RIP constants, δ2s
(Z), δ2s
(Z), and
+
δ2s (PD̂ Z). Unfortunately, these RIP constants in (12) are difficult

to evaluate. Hence, in some applications, it is more convenient to
use a slightly stronger but much simpler and interpretable condition called the “mutual incoherence property” (MIP). Specifically, let D̂ = PZ D and Z.j 2 = 1 for all j = 1, . . . , L. Define
the constants μ and ρ as
μ = max |ZT.i Z.j |
i=j

and

ρ = max |D̂T Z.j |/D̂2 .
j

(14)

First, the constant μ measures the maximum correlation between any two columns of the matrix of instruments Z. This
is related to Assumption (a) in Section 3.1 where a full rank
Z means the columns of Z are linearly independent. In fact,
if μ < 1/(L − 1), Z is full rank. Second, the constant ρ measures the maximum strength of individual instruments. A high ρ
doesn’t necessarily imply that all L instruments are individually
strong; it just implies that one of the L instruments is strong
(i.e., has a high correlation to D); it’s possible that the rest of
the L − 1 instruments are weak. This notion of strength by ρ is
slightly different than the concentration parameter, which measures the overall strength of all the L instruments (see, Section 4
for details). Also, ρ stands in contrast to Condition (b) in Theorem 1 which looks at the individual values of γj , j = 1, . . . , L,
instead of the maximum of γj ’s.
Given the two MIP constants μ and ρ, we have the following
result on estimation performance. Like Theorem 2, Corollary 2
characterizes all the minimizers β̂λ from sisVIVE in (10).
Corollary 2 (Estimation performance of sisVIVE under
MIP). Let the MIP constants μ and ρ be given in (14). If the

We make the following remarks. First, in the supplementary materials, we show the condition in Equation (15) directly
implies the condition in Equation (11). We also provide an example of a matrix of instruments Z where the RIP condition
is satisfied, but the MIP condition is not satisfied. Second, the
constraint on the number of invalid instruments, s, in Corollary
2 is strict, but is required to precisely characterize the bound
on estimation performance. As two reviewers pointed out, if the
instruments are even slightly correlated at μ = 0.1, s < 10/12,
no invalid instruments are allowed, and Corollary 2 is not useful in characterizing the performance of sisVIVE. In Section 4
and in the supplementary materials, we study the behavior of
sisVIVE when this constraint in (15) may not hold. Third, in the
case where all the instruments are uncorrelated with each other
so that μ = 0, a small ρ provides a less restrictive upper bound
on s. At first glance, this may be counterintuitive since a small
ρ implies that all the instruments’ individual correlation to the
exposure is weak and, therefore, having weak instruments allow
one to have more invalid instruments. However, we note that the
denominator of the bound (16), specifically D̂22 is a function
of the correlation of the instruments, and having a small ρ would
translate to having a small D̂22 . Hence, even though the condition (15) allows for more invalid instruments, the upper bound
(16) becomes worse and our estimator β̂λ will be far from β ∗ .
Finally, we emphasize that the conditions in both Theorem 2 and
Corollary 2 are sufficient, but not necessary conditions for the
performance bounds to hold. In particular, a violation of these
conditions does not imply that sisVIVE will perform badly (see
Section 4 and the supplementary materials).
3.5 Fast Numerical Algorithm
In addition to the theoretical guarantees on estimation performance, in practice, a fast, scalable numerical algorithm for
estimation is desirable, especially for MR where genetic data
can be large. Theorem 3 outlines a two-step numerical method
whose solution is identical to sisVIVE in (10), but is as fast as
OLS.
Theorem 3 (Fast two-step numerical algorithm). Let PD̂ be
the projection matrix onto the vector D̂ and PD̂⊥ = I − PD̂ . We
propose the two-step algorithm as follows.
Step 1. For a given λ > 0, solve
1
α̂ λ ∈ argmin ||PD̂⊥ PZ Y − PD̂⊥ Zα||22 + λ||α||1 .
2
α
Step 2. Use α̂ λ from Step 1 to estimate β̂λ by
β̂λ =

D̂T (Y − Zα̂ λ )
||D̂||22

.

The solution to the two-step algorithm is identical to the
solution to sisVIVE in (10)
In the two-step algorithm, Step 1 is the standard Lasso problem with outcome PD̂⊥ PZ Y and PD̂⊥ Z; remember, sisVIVE in
(10) is not the standard Lasso problem as discussed in Section
3.2. Fast algorithms for the Lasso exist, most notably LARS
(Efron et al. 2004). In fact, LARS is able to solve α̂ λ for all values of λ > 0 at the same computational efficiency as OLS. Step

2 is also numerically efficient, requiring a simple dot product
operation between D̂ and Y − Zα̂ λ . Thus, the proposed two-step
algorithm is, practically speaking, as fast as OLS. Best of all, the
estimate from this two-step algorithm is identical to sisVIVE.
4. SIMULATION STUDY
We conduct various simulation studies to study the estimation performance, measured by |β̂ − β ∗ |, for different methods.
Specifically, we compare sisVIVE with TSLS, the most popular
estimator in IV and MR, and OLS under various settings that
vary the instruments’ absolute/overall and relative strength, their
validity and correlation among each other, and endogeneity.
Let there be n = 2000 individuals and L = 10 potential candidate instruments. The observations (Yi , Di , Zi. ), i = 1, . . . , n
are generated by

0, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75, by setting all the off-diagonal elements of
the covariance matrix of Zi. to this value. For (iv), we vary the
absolute/overall instrument strength by the concentration parameter. The concentration parameter is a popular measure for
instrument strength; high values of the concentration parameter
indicate the overall strength of all L instruments are strong and
vice versa. The concentration parameter is also the population
value of the first stage F statistic for the instruments when the
exposure is regressed on them; this first stage F statistic is often used to check instrument strength (Stock, Wright, and Yogo
2002). Based on Table 1 in Stock, Wright, and Yogo (2002), a
set of instruments with a concentration parameter (scaled by the
number of valid instruments) of around 10 is considered weak in
the absolute/overall sense and instruments with a concentration
parameter (scaled by the number of valid instruments) of around
100 is considered strong in the absolute/overall sense. Finally
for (v), we vary the relative instrument strength by changing the
individual entries of the vector γ ∗ while keeping the concentration parameter fixed. Specifically, for a particular concentration parameter, we consider instruments to have equal relative
strength if γj∗ = γk∗ for all j = k and variable relative strength
if γj∗ = 2 ∗ γk∗ for various values of j = k.
For each simulation setting, we repeat the simulation
1000 times. For each repetition, we compute sisVIVE’s estimate of the causal effect, β̂λ , where λ is chosen by 10-fold
cross-validation outlined in Section 3.3. We also compute es-

timates from TSLS and OLS. For TSLS, we run two types of
TSLS. First, we run the “naive” TSLS as if all the instruments
are valid. This is quite common in MR studies where all the
instruments are assumed to be valid and the causal estimate is
computed using TSLS. When some of the instruments are in
fact invalid, naive TSLS should give biased estimates. Second,
we run TSLS as if we knew exactly which instruments are valid,
that is, the “oracle” TSLS. Specifically, we use the knowledge
of the support of α ∗ and run TSLS controlling for the invalid instruments that are in the support of α ∗ as covariates. Finally, we
run OLS with Z and D as our regressors and Y as our outcome.
We expect OLS to perform poorly when there is substantial
endogeneity by D since OLS cannot control for endogenous
variables. But, OLS should be more efficient than IV methods
if there is no endogeneity (Richardson and Wu 1971).
Figure 2 shows the estimation error when endogeneity is
varied. The number of invalid instruments is fixed at s = 3
and we consider 16 different sets of instruments based on their
absolute and relative strength as well as their pairwise correlations. For example, the top lefthand plot of Figure 2 corresponds to instruments whose overall strength is strong (i.e.,
scaled concentration parameter is around 100) , their relative
strength is equal (i.e., γj∗ are identical for all j = 1, . . . , L),
and their pairwise correlations are 0. In contrast, the bottom right plot of Figure 2 corresponds to instruments whose
their overall strength is weak (i.e., scaled concentration parameter is around 10), their relative strength is variable (i.e.,
γj∗ = 2 ∗ γk∗ for j = k) and their pairwise correlations are equal
to 0.75.
As expected, OLS dominates naive TSLS, oracle TSLS, and
sisVIVE when the endogeneity is small and close to zero, with
the dominance being greater for weak instruments. Once there is
a sufficient amount of endogeneity, oracle TSLS, which knows
exactly which instruments are valid and invalid, does best. However, sisVIVE, which is a feasible rather than infeasible oracle
estimator, is close to the oracle TSLS; the gap between oracle TSLS and sisVIVE gets larger as the instruments’ absolute
strength gets weaker. Regardless of instrument strength, naive
TSLS, which assumes all the L instruments are valid, has a high
error since it cannot take into account the bias introduced by
invalid instruments.
Figure 3 shows the estimation error when the number of
∗
, is fixed at
invalid instruments is varied. The endogeneity, σξ
0.8. Like Figure 2, we consider the same 16 sets of instruments.
We first see that at s = 0, that is, when there are no invalid
instruments, sisVIVE’s performance is nearly identical to naive
and oracle TSLS. However, sisVIVE does not use the knowledge
that one knows exactly which instruments are valid while the
two TSLS estimators do. Also, sisVIVE’s performance degrades

slightly for instruments with weak absolute strength when the
correlation between instruments increases.
When s < L/2 = 5, sisVIVE’s performance is comparable to
oracle TSLS and better than naive TSLS. However, for instruments with weak absolute strength, sisVIVE does slightly worse
compared to the oracle TSLS than for instruments with strong
absolute strength. Once we reach the identification boundary
in Corollary 1, s < L/2 = 5, sisVIVE’s performance becomes
similar to naive TSLS. This is the case regardless of the instruments’ absolute and relative strength. Finally, for any s, oracle
TSLS performs much better than all the other estimators.
Also, in all 16 sets of instruments, we compute the ρ and μ
found in the condition for Corollary 2 from the simulated data
and this is detailed in supplementary materials. For example,
the top lefthand plot of Figure 2 has ρ of approximately 0.31
and μ = 0. Based on this, the upper bound on s in Corollary 2
is 1.04. However, since s = 3 for the simulations in Figure 2,
the condition (15) in Corollary 2 is violated and cannot be
used to characterize the behavior of sisVIVE. Regardless, in our
simulation study presented in this section, sisVIVE performs
just as well as the oracle TSLS.
In supplementary materials, we expand the simulation study
to cover different types of instrument strength, correlation structure between instruments, and total number of potential instruments. We also explore different metrics of error, such as the
proportion of correctly selected valid instruments and invalid instruments, to analyze the relationship between these proportionbased error metrics and the median bias error metric used in this
Section. In addition, we also compute the conditions for Corollary 2, specifically ρ, μ, and λ required to achieve the performance bound. The supplementary materials show that in every
case considered, sisVIVE performs no worse than the next best
alternative, naive TSLS. In fact, in most cases, sisVIVE beats
naive TSLS and performs similarly to the oracle TSLS. The
only case where sisVIVE’s performance deviated greatly from
the oracle TSLS was when the invalid instruments were weaker
than the valid instruments and s = 4. In addition, supplementary materials show that a good estimate of β ∗ depends strongly
on correctly selecting the invalid instruments more than correctly selecting the valid instruments and choosing λ based on
cross-validation seems to favor this situation. We also find that
choosing λ based on Corollary 2 leads to a higher λ than one
based on cross-validation. Finally, we find that sisVIVE based
on λ chosen by cross-validation always performed at least as
well as sisVIVE based on λ chosen by Corollary 2. In fact, in
most cases, sisVIVE with a cross-validated λ performs better
than sisVIVE with a λ chosen by Corollary 2.
Overall, sisVIVE using a cross-validated λ does much better
than naive TSLS, the most frequently used estimator in MR

absolute estimation error (|β ∗ − β̂|) after 1000 simulations. We fix the number of invalid instruments to s = 3. Each column in the plot corresponds
to a different variation of instruments’ absolute and relative strength. There are two types of absolute strengths, “Strong” and “Weak,” measured
by the concentration parameter. There are two types of relative strengths, “Equal” and “Variable,” measured by varying γ ∗ while holding the
absolute strength (i.e., concentration parameter) fixed. Each row corresponds to the maximum correlation between instruments.

and IV. In many cases, sisVIVE beats the naive TSLS and it is
comparable to oracle TSLS. The promising simulation results
suggest that sisVIVE should be used whenever there is concern
about invalid instruments.
5. DATA ANALYSIS
We demonstrate the potential benefit of using sisVIVE in MR
by analyzing the effect of obesity, the exposure, on HRQL, the
outcome. An individual’s quality of life is the general well-being
of the individual; an individual’s health quality of life is the subset of quality of life related to the individual’s health (Torrance
1987). Previous non-MR studies by Trakas et al. (2001) and

Sach et al. (2007) have shown that there is a negative association between obesity and HRQL. However, a fundamental
difficulty with these studies is that the outcome, HRQL, encompasses various factors about the individual, making it difficult
to control for all possible confounders that may affect obesity
and HRQL (Cawley and Meyerhoefer 2012). An MR approach
offers the potential of controlling for unmeasured confounders.
For the analysis, we use the data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS), a well-known longitudinal study that has
kept track of American high school graduates from Wisconsin
since 1957. We look at graduates that were reinterviewed in
2003–2005 (Hauser 2005) and who have been genotyped. Similar to another analysis with the WLS genetic data, we remove

Figure 3. Simulation study of estimation performance varying the number of invalid instruments (s). There are 10 (L = 10) instruments.
Each line represents median absolute estimation error (|β ∗ − β̂|) after 1000 simulations. We fix the endogeneity σξ∗ to σξ∗ = 0.8. Each column
in the plot corresponds to a different variation of instruments’ absolute and relative strength. There are two types of absolute strengths, “Strong”
and “Weak,” measured by the concentration parameter. There are two types of relative strengths, “Equal” and “Variable,” measured by varying
γ ∗ while holding the absolute strength fixed. Each row corresponds to maximum correlation between instruments.

individuals with more than 10% missing genotype data (Roetker
et al. 2012). Our analysis of the dataset contains n = 3712 individuals with 1913 females and 1799 males born mostly between
1938 and 1940.
To measure HRQL, we use the Health Utility Index Mark 3
(HUI-3) which was also used in Trakas et al. (2001). HUI-3 is
a composite score of utility between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating
highest health state and 0 indicating a health state equivalent to
death; negative utility is possible and indicates that the person
is alive, but in a state worse than death. To measure obesity, we
use the BMI and the U.S. National Institute of Health clinical
guidelines (National Institute of Health 1998) that were also
used in Trakas et al. (2001) and Sach et al. (2007) in their anal-

ysis. Specifically, we follow Trakas et al. (2001) and define the
exposure by assigning individuals with BMI less than 30 (i.e.,
not obese) to be 0, individuals with BMI between 30 and 35
(i.e., obese class I) to be 1, individuals with BMI between 35
and 40 (i.e., obese class II) to be 2, and individuals with BMI
greater than 40 (i.e., obese class III) to be 3 so that each value
of the exposure corresponds to the increasing obese classes
used in Trakas et al. (2001) and the U.S. National Institutes of
Health clinical guidelines (National Institutes of Health 1998).
For instance, exposure value of zero corresponds to nonobese
individuals while exposure value of two corresponds to individuals in obese class II. Hence, the causal effect of interest is the
effect of moving up in the obese class; specifically β ∗ in model

142

(1) will correspond to the effect of moving up one obese class
on the HUI-3 index of HRQL. In supplementary materials, we
explore different methods to quantify obesity and the resulting
estimates from different methods.
For potential candidate instruments, we use the following
SNPs in the WLS that have been previously shown to be associated with obesity: rs1421085, rs1501299, and rs2241766
(see, Table 1). rs1421085 is in the FTO gene and it has been
shown to be strongly associated with obesity (Dina et al. 2007;
Price, Li, and Zhao 2008). rs1501299 (i.e., +276G>T) is in
the ADIPOQ gene that encodes adiponectin, a protein encoding for lipid metabolism, and has been associated with obesity
(Bouatia-Naji et al. 2006; Yang et al. 2007). Finally, rs2241766
is also in the ADIPOQ gene that has been associated with obesity (Ukkola et al. 2003; Yang et al. 2003; Beckers et al. 2009).
For all the SNPs, we follow an MR study done by Timpson
et al. (2005) and assume an additive model. Although we have
no particular reason to think any of the SNPs is an invalid IV,
we are uncertain due to the lack of complete knowledge about
the biological functions of the SNPs, a common scenario in MR
studies. Our sisVIVE estimator will provide a good estimate as
long as least two of the three SNPs are valid IVs.
A simple OLS analysis estimates that an increase in one obese
class is associated with a 0.052 (SE: 0.0040) decrease in HUI-3
score. The reduced form estimates along with the first stage F
statistics are summarized in the supplementary materials.
If we use TSLS, under the operating assumption that all the
instruments are valid, the estimated causal effect is −0.00094
(SE: 0.081), that is, climbing up one obese class reduces your
health utility quality of life by 0.00094. Our estimator, sisVIVE,
which operates only under the assumption that a proportion of
instruments are invalid, estimates −0.00094 as the causal effect,
which is identical to the estimate by TSLS. Also, sisVIVE does
not select any SNPs as an invalid IV. The overidentifying restrictions test and the implied structural correlation between Di and
the error term are summarized in the supplementary materials.
To further validate our method, we include another instrument, rs6265 (i.e., Val66Met). rs6265 is in the brain-derived
neurotrophic factor BDNF gene and has been shown to not only
be associated with BMI (Thorleifsson et al. 2008; Shugart et al.
2009), but also neurological and cognitive function (Hwang et al.
2006; Rybakowski et al. 2006). Hence, there is some reason
to believe that rs6265 may be pleiotropic; rs6265 may impact
obesity, but also affect HRQL through mechanisms other than
obesity. sisVIVE should be able to pick up on this instrument
being invalid in contrast to TSLS, which will always assume
that all the instruments used are valid.
If we use TSLS under the operating assumption that all the
four instruments are valid, the estimated effect is −0.0086
(SE:0.080). sisVIVE, on the other hand, estimates the causal
effect to be −0.0037, which is closer to the estimates when we
used three instruments. sisVIVE also throws out the instrument,
rs6265, which we suspect to be invalid. The reduced form estimates and the overidentifying restrictions test are summarized
in the supplementary materials.
In both data analyses, sisVIVE operates under the assumption of possibly invalid instruments, which are typical in MR
studies, while TSLS operates under the assumption of all valid
instruments. In the first data analysis where there was no reason

Journal of the American Statistical Association, March 2016

to believe that the instruments were invalid, sisVIVE provides
the same answer as TSLS, but without assuming that all the
instruments were valid. In the second data analysis where one
instrument was suspect, sisVIVE removed the suspected instrument. In both cases, sisVIVE was robust to possibly invalid
instruments compared to TSLS.
6. DISCUSSION
This article demonstrates that proper estimation of causal
effects using the IV method is possible without knowledge of all
the instruments’ validity. Our results show that simply knowing
a proportion of the instrument is valid, without knowing which
are valid, is sufficient and we construct the sisVIVE estimator
that dominates the naive TSLS in almost every aspect while
performing similarly to the oracle TSLS. Both the simulation
result and data analysis show that sisVIVE is a robust alternative
to TSLS in the presence of possibly invalid instruments.
Future work could involve generalizing the model considered. In particular, the current article discusses a model in
which treatment effects are constant. Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin (1996) discusses the setting in which the treatment effects are not constant and individuals may select into treatment
based on expected gains from treatment. Then, qm and qm in
Theorem 1 might not be equal to each other for different sets
of valid instruments and Theorem 1 does not apply. It would be
useful to understand what sisVIVE is estimating under this setting of treatment effect heterogeneity. Other useful directions
for future work are relaxing the conditions on Corollary 2 to
encompass more invalid instruments s and deriving tests for
identification. Also, we have focused on the applications of our
method to Mendelian randomization. In economic applications,
it is also common to have multiple candidate instruments and be
concerned that some proportion of the instruments are invalid
(Murray 2006). Our current work demonstrates that instrumental variable estimation is definitely possible even in the presence
of possibly invalid instruments.
