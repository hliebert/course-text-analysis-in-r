SUMMARY
Cox’s regression model is widely used for assessing associations between potential risk factors and
disease occurrence in epidemiologic cohort studies. Although age is often a strong determinant of
disease risk, authors have frequently used time-on-study instead of age as the time-scale, as for clinical
trials. Unless the baseline hazard is an exponential function of age, this approach can yield dierent
estimates of relative hazards than using age as the time-scale, even when age is adjusted for. We
performed a simulation study in order to investigate the existence and magnitude of bias for dierent
degrees of association between age and the covariate of interest. Age to disease onset was generated from
exponential, Weibull or piecewise Weibull distributions, and both xed and time-dependent dichotomous
covariates were considered. We observed no bias upon using age as the time-scale. Upon using timeon-study, we veried the absence of bias for exponentially distributed age to disease onset. For nonexponential distributions, we found that bias could occur even when the covariate of interest was
independent from age. It could be severe in case of substantial association with age, especially with timedependent covariates. These ndings were illustrated on data from a cohort of 84 329 French women
followed prospectively for breast cancer occurrence. In view of our results, we strongly recommend not
using time-on-study as the time-scale for analysing epidemiologic cohort data. Copyright ? 2004 John

1. INTRODUCTION
Cox’s semiparametric model [1] is widely used for the analysis of survival or duration-type
data both in clinical trials and epidemiologic cohort studies. In this model a time variable or
time-scale, W , has to be dened. Based on this denition, at any time W = w, the hazard rate
h(w) is the product of a non-parametric baseline hazard h0 (w) and a parametric function of

explanatory covariates Z and corresponding parameters , usually taken to be the exponential
function, such that h(w | Z = z) = h0 (w) exp( z).
Cox’s model was developed originally with clinical applications in mind, where individuals
are generally followed up since the diagnosis of a given disease or initiation of treatment
until death, remission or relapse. In this context, the natural time-scale W is the delay from
inclusion, also called length of follow-up or time-on-study. Thus, the number of subjects at risk
monotonically diminishes with time so that successive risk sets are nested. Such a structure
denes a closed cohort. Usually, adjustment for age at recruitment is performed through the
inclusion of a continuous or categorical covariate in the parametric term, exp( z).
In most epidemiologic cohort studies, subjects are followed up prospectively for the occurrence of a given disease. Upon analysing such data, the eect of age needs to be tightly
controlled because the incidence of most diseases, especially chronic diseases, is strongly determined by age. The natural time-scale W is then (attained) age. Using time-on-study as
the time-scale would generally not be relevant, especially when the inclusion into the cohort
coincides with an interview, which is not supposed to modify one’s risk. Indeed in epidemiologic cohort studies, contrary to clinical studies, the time when a subject rst comes under
observation usually does not coincide with the time when the subject becomes at risk for the
disease of interest.
Although Cox’s model with age as the time-scale has a similar expression to that of Cox’s
model with time-on-study as the time-scale, implicit mechanisms are dierent, apart from right
censoring. Indeed, at a given age, some subjects are not yet under observation whereas others
are no more. Thus, the number of subjects at risk does not vary monotonically with age and
risk sets are not nested, unlike with the use of the time-on-study scale. This structure denes
an open cohort, under which a subject’s observation is conditional to the fact that he=she
was free of disease at his=her age of recruitment. Thus, using age as the time-scale implies
staggered or delayed entry with left truncation occurring at the age at inclusion [2].
Upon using age as the time-scale, the hazard function can be directly interpreted as the agespecic incidence function [2]. Also, because age is taken into account in the non-parametric
term of the hazard function without any need for modelling its eect, a more eective control
of age ensues. Hence, several authors have recommended to use age as the time-scale for the
analysis of epidemiologic cohort studies [3–5].
Yet Cox’s regression with time-on-study as the time-scale, usually with some form of ageadjustment, has been commonly used instead for the analysis of epidemiologic cohort data in
order to assess associations between covariates and risk of disease occurrence. This approach
can be misleading because it yields estimates that may dier from those resulting from using
age as the time-scale. However, Korn et al. [4] derived two sucient conditions under which
Cox’s model with age as the time-scale and Cox’s model with time-on-study as the time-scale
adjusting for age at recruitment as a continuous covariate will agree. First, these authors formally established that, under the condition of the hazard function belonging to a family of exponential distributions (later referred to as the ‘exponential family’), that is, at any age W = a,
h0 (a) = c exp( a) for given c¿0 and (condition 1), the two approaches yield exactly identical estimates. Second, they claimed that, in case of independence between the covariate of
interest and age at recruitment (condition 2), estimates from the two approaches should not
be too far from each other. For this second condition, Korn et al. [4] relied on heuristic reasoning rather than a formal proof and referred to results given by Gail et al. [6] pertaining to
the issue of covariate omission. Based on analytical results or simulations, Gail et al. [6] and

other authors [7–13] showed that downward bias in estimating the eect of a covariate can
result from omitting a prognostic factor from Cox’s regression model, even when the covariate
of interest is independent from the omitted prognostic factor. Thus, carrying over the analogy
between the issue of covariate omission and that of time-scale choice, these results tend to
suggest that omitting or mismodelling age as an adjustment factor in a follow-up-dependent
Cox model instead of using age as the time-scale could also lead to biases, contrary to
Korn et al.’s reasoning.
In order to clarify this issue, we performed a simulation study to determine whether independence between the covariate of interest and age at inclusion is also a sucient condition for obtaining unbiased estimates. A second objective of the study was to investigate
the magnitude of the bias for dierent degrees of association between age at inclusion and
the covariate of interest and several types of incidence functions. This investigation was
aimed at complementing limited results from small-scale simulations based on a single set of
parameters [5] or from cohort study examples [4, 14]. Some features of our simulation study
were borrowed from the E3N prospective cohort study [15], the main characteristics of which
are described below.

2. COHORT STUDY EXAMPLE
The E3N cohort study (‘Etude Epidemiologique aupres de Femmes de la Mutuelle Generale
de l’Education Nationale’) is a prospective study whose main goal is to assess associations between lifestyle risk factors and cancer occurrence in women [15]. Women residing in
metropolitan France (i.e. without Corsica or overseas territories) and aged 40–65 years were
recruited among members of the health insurance plan of the national educational system.
Overall, 98 997 volunteers (around 20 per cent of all eligible women) agreed to participate
after a formal invitation, consent form and baseline questionnaire had been mailed to them
in January or June 1989 for three pilot administrative areas (‘departements’) of metropolitan
France, and in June 1990 for the remaining 91 administrative areas. Active follow-up was performed through biennial questionnaires. Pathological reports of women who reported cancer
occurrence during follow-up were sought from their general practitioner.
In this paper, we focused on the relationship of breast cancer risk with menopausal status at
recruitment (i.e. as a xed covariate) and during follow-up (i.e. as a time-dependent covariate).
Such adjustment for menopausal status at recruitment is common in epidemiologic cohort
studies when only baseline measurements are available. The study sample consisted of 84 329
French women without any previous diagnosis of cancer and who were either postmenopausal
with non-missing age at menopause or still premenopausal at the end of follow-up. The
outcome of interest was incident primary invasive breast cancer as a rst cancer. The cut-o
date for this analysis was June 28,2000, when the last validated follow-up questionnaire was
sent (administrative censoring). Other censoring resulted from the occurrence of in situ breast
cancer or cancer of another site during follow-up, loss of follow-up, in which case the date
of last response to a questionnaire was used as the censoring date, or death. For an average
follow-up of 9.7 years, 2461 invasive breast cancer cases were reported and included in the
analysis, among which 97.9 per cent were histologically conrmed. The observed percentage
of censoring was thus 97.1 per cent. Analyses of the example data were performed using
Stata software [16].

3. SIMULATION STUDY
3.1. Methods
For each situation considered, we generated 1000 independent samples of 50 000 subjects
each. To generate age at recruitment, we relied on the age distribution observed at entry in
the E3N cohort among the 40–65 year old participants without any previous cancer diagnosis
[15]. In all simulations, a dichotomous covariate Z was considered and was assumed to act
multiplicatively on the hazard of disease onset on the age scale, with relative hazard exp()
for the exposed category compared to the unexposed. Age to disease onset was generated from
exponential, Weibull or piecewise Weibull distributions. As for the exponential distribution, a
special case of the exponential family was selected with = 0 and c = , namely the constanthazard exponential distribution (later referred to as the ‘exponential distribution’). In contrast,
neither Weibull distributions with shape parameter  = 1 (where the baseline hazard function
is dened at any age W = a as h0 (a) =  a−1 ) nor piecewise Weibull distributions belong
to the exponential family. To avoid any assumptions about the shape of disease incidence
before inclusion into the cohort, we generated distribution functions conditional to diseasefree survival until age at inclusion. Right censoring was either administrative (at 10 years of
follow-up) or due to death from other causes than breast cancer, with survival times generated
using constant rates by 10-year age intervals, as given by the 1995 French national mortality
statistics (available on http://sc8.vesinet.inserm.fr:1080).
We rst explored situations in which condition 2 held in order to verify whether this is
a sucient condition for the absence of bias in estimating the eect of a given covariate.
Namely, we generated the covariate of interest, Z0 , as a balanced dichotomous variable irrespective of age at inclusion. We examined situations in which condition 1 held in addition to
condition 2, that is age to disease onset was generated from an exponential distribution, and
situations in which condition 1 did not hold. For the latter case, we used Weibull distributions
with shape parameter  = 4. This value was selected to obtain hazard rates increasing with
age (i.e. ¿1) as is the case with breast cancer incidence up to age 65 years, and to provide
a clear departure from exponential distributions (for which  = 1). To identify situations in
which bias could occur, we considered various degrees of association between Z0 and disease
occurrence, with six values of relative hazard exp(), namely 1, 1.5, 2, 5, 10 and 50, for the
exposed compared to the unexposed category. Values of  as large as ln 50, although rarely
observed in practice, were chosen because we expected bias magnitude to increase with that of
, inferring from studies on covariate omission [8, 9]. Moreover, as one study also suggested
that bias magnitude would be maximum for a censoring percentage of 50 per cent or less
[11], we evaluated bias for 50 per cent censoring rst, then for heavier censoring, namely 60,
70, 80, 90 and 95 per cent censoring, expecting a decrease in bias magnitude with increasing
censoring. Scale parameters  of exponential and Weibull distributions were adjusted to obtain
the desired censoring percentages according to the value of .
Second, we aimed at evaluating the magnitude of bias in estimating the eect of covariates
associated with age. We examined the cases of two xed covariates, Z1 and Z2 , positively associated with age at inclusion, as well as the case of a time-dependent covariate, Z3 . Namely,
covariate Z1 was moderately associated with age, probabilities of the exposed category being
0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 in age groups 40–44, 45–49, 50–54, 55–59 and 60+ years, respectively. Covariate Z2 was more strongly associated with age, with corresponding probabilities
0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8 and 0.9. The time-dependent covariate Z3 was dened as a dichotomous

variable, changing from the at-birth unexposed level to the exposed level at a given age generated from a normal distribution with parameters derived from that of age at menopause in
the E3N cohort (i.e. mean = 50 years, standard deviation = 4:5 years). For all distributions of
age to disease onset considered, we selected scale parameters that provided a reasonable t
of the incidence in the unexposed category to the observed incidence of breast cancer in the
French population in 1995 for the age range 40–75 years [17] (see Figure 1). The age range
40–75 years was considered in order to encompass the ten years of follow-up of 40–65 year
old women in the E3N study, and the year 1995 was considered because it was the midpoint
of the follow-up period (from 1990 to 2000) in that study. Specically, age to disease onset was generated from an exponential distribution with scale parameter  = 0:0022, as well
as from a Weibull distribution with shape parameter  = 4, as before, and scale parameter
 = 0:0076. Moreover, as the breast cancer incidence curve seemed to show a slight inexion
around age 60 years (Figure 1), a piecewise Weibull distribution was also considered in order
to possibly improve the t relative to a single Weibull distribution. Shape parameters were
arbitrarily set at 1 = 4 up to age 60 years (i.e. 40–59 years) and 2 = 0:25 for age 60 years
and over, and respective scale parameters 1 = 0:0079 and 2 = 0:0031 were selected. For all
three distributions and all three covariates, there followed censoring percentages of about
98 per cent in the unexposed category, close to what was observed in the whole E3N
cohort. Results are presented for  = 0 and ln 5.

either as a continuous covariate (model 2) or as a categorical variable with a dummy variable for every ve-year interval except the rst one (model 3), with stratication on age at
recruitment in ve categories of ve years each (model 4), and using age as the time-scale
(model 5). All models included the dichotomous covariate Z and corresponding parameter
 in their parametric term. For each replication, we estimated , its standard error and the
standardized test statistic obtained as the ratio of these two estimates. Results presented are
the average bias on log relative hazard estimates (i.e.  estimates) and associated standard
deviation derived from the distribution across the 1000 simulated samples, both multiplied
by 103 . We assessed the presence of bias using the ratio of the average bias to its standard
deviation as a standardized test statistic. As we performed up to 6 × 6 × 5 = 180 tests of signicance, bias was considered statistically signicant at the 0.05 level for two-sided p-values
less than 2:5 × 10−4 , in order to take into account multiple comparisons. The proportion of
replications out of 1000 where the parameter estimate was found statistically dierent from 0
at the two-sided 0.05 level was used as an estimate of type I error for simulations with  = 0
or power for simulations with  = 0. Simulations were all performed using SAS [18].
3.2. Covariate independent from age at inclusion
We rst explored situations in which condition 2 held, computing estimates of the log
relative hazard  associated with the exposed category of the age-independent covariate
Z0 from the ve models of analysis described above. To begin with, we examined situations in which age to disease onset was generated from exponential distributions so that
both conditions 1 and 2 held. Whatever the degree of association between Z0 and disease risk (as determined by ) and whatever the censoring percentage (achieved by adjusting scale parameter ), bias was found non-signicant and at most equal to 6 × 10−3 .
This maximal value was reached for  =ln 50 and 95 per cent censoring with all ve Cox
regression models.
Then, we considered single Weibull distributions with same shape parameter  = 4, i.e.
not meeting condition 1, and scale parameters adjusted to obtain overall censoring percentages approximately equal to 50 per cent on average (Table I). Under the null hypothesis,  = 0, no bias was apparent with any of the ve Cox models, with bias equal to 0
up to the third decimal point. Consequently, type I errors were found not statistically different from the two-sided nominal value 0.05. For non-null values of , however, contrasted results were observed among the ve models. While the age-dependent Cox model
(model 5) provided unbiased  estimates in all situations, bias was apparent in some situations for the follow-up-dependent Cox models (models 1–4). When age was completely
omitted (model 1), a pronounced and signicant underestimation of  was observed. Note
that, although the magnitude of the mean absolute bias increased with that of , the relative bias remained virtually constant and equal to −4:2 per cent up to the rst decimal point. A far less pronounced overestimation was seen when age at recruitment was
included as a continuous adjustment factor (model 2), becoming signicant from  = ln 5
but remaining moderate. When age was adjusted for in a categorical form (model 3), bias
was signicant, albeit of very small magnitude, only for the extreme relative hazard of
50 for the exposed category of covariate Z0 . Where bias was signicant with model 3,
it was also signicant with the follow-up-dependent Cox model stratied on age at recruitment (model 4) but in the opposite direction. Despite the strong underestimation with

Dierent from the true parameter value at p (two-sided) ¡2:5 × 10−4 .
Results from Cox proportional hazards analysis (ve models) of 1000 independent samples of 50 000 individuals, with age to disease onset generated from Weibull distributions with shape parameter  = 4 and scale
parameters  selected to yield approximately 50 per cent overall censoring on average.

model 1, statistical power was estimated at 100 per cent for all ve non-null values of 
considered, as well as with all four other models, because of the very large sample size
(i.e. 25 000 events on average).
We also examined the inuence of censoring by considering ve higher censoring percentages (i.e. 60, 70, 80, 90 and 95 per cent) in addition to 50 per cent. Again, no bias was
observed when age was used as the time-scale (model 5), bias being non-signicant and at
most equal to 3 × 10−3 for all six values of censoring percentages and all six values of 
considered. In the Cox regression model with time-on-study as the time-scale and age included
as a categorical covariate (model 3), bias was at most 5 × 10−3 and appeared signicant in
one extreme case only, i.e. for  = ln 50 and 50 per cent censoring. In the Cox regression
model stratied on age (model 4), signicant underestimation was observed with values of
 greater or equal to ln 5 up to 60 per cent censoring only. Again, the largest bias, that is
−8 × 10−3 , was seen for  = ln 50 and 50 per cent censoring. Results from the two remaining
models, i.e. not including age at recruitment (model 1) or including it as a continuous covariate (model 2), are shown on Figure 2. With these two models, we observed no bias for  = 0
whatever the censoring percentage and a decrease in bias magnitude with increasing censoring
percentages for non-null values of . For model 1, signicant underestimation persisted up
to 80 per cent censoring for  = ln 1:5 and up to 90 per cent censoring for higher values
of . With  = ln 10 and 80 per cent censoring for instance, bias magnitude was moderate
with mean absolute bias equal to −26 × 10−3 , corresponding to a relative bias of −1:1 per
cent. For model 2, signicant overestimation was seen only for values of  greater or equal
to ln 5 and persisted up to 60 per cent censoring for  = ln 5 and ln 10, and up to 70 per
cent censoring for  = ln 50. However, it remained less than 15 × 10−3 in all cases. It is
worth noting that for 95 per cent censoring, a value typical of epidemiologic cohort studies,
none of the ve models produced signicantly biased estimates for any of the six values of
 considered.

age to disease onset generated from a Weibull distribution with shape parameter  = 4 and varying
scale parameters selected to yield six censoring percentages values.

3.3. Covariate associated with age at inclusion
We then examined situations in which condition 2 did not hold. Namely, the xed covariates
Z1 and Z2 , respectively moderately and strongly associated with age at inclusion, as well as the
time-dependent covariate Z3 , were considered successively. Table II shows the average bias on
 estimates from the ve Cox models of analysis when no eect of the covariate of interest
was assumed, that is  = 0, and for exponential, Weibull and piecewise Weibull distributions
of age to disease onset. No bias was apparent when the exponential distribution was used to
generate age to disease onset or when data were analysed using Cox’s regression model with
age as the time-scale (model 5). For both single and piecewise Weibull distributions, however,
strong biases in the direction of overestimation were observed in the model where age was
not at all taken into account (model 1), whichever the covariate under study. For instance, the
mean absolute bias was 0.439 for estimating the log relative hazard associated with covariate
Z2 when age to disease onset was generated from a Weibull distribution. In the three models
using time-on-study as the time-scale and adjusting for or stratifying on age at recruitment,
signicant biases of smaller magnitude (between 0.032 and 0.166) were observed with the
time-dependent covariate Z3 only. Adjusting for age as a categorical variable (model 3) rather
than a continuous variable (model 2) reduced bias under the piecewise Weibull distribution but
increased it under the single Weibull distribution. Stratifying on age at recruitment (model 4)
yielded overestimation of intermediate magnitude with the single Weibull distribution and
of lower magnitude with the piecewise Weibull distribution. Where bias was signicant,

type I error was far above its nominal 0.05 value, especially with model 1. With the piecewise Weibull distribution for instance, type I errors were 32.5, 90.6 and 99.9 per cent for
covariates Z1 , Z2 and Z3 , respectively, with model 1, 47.1, 21.4 and 7.0 per cent for covariate
Z3 with models 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Values with model 1 were even higher with the
single Weibull distribution, namely 89.5, 100.0 and 100.0 per cent for covariates Z1 , Z2 and
Z3 , respectively. They were lower, however, for covariate Z3 with models 2, 3 and 4, namely
6.5, 8.0 and 5.9 per cent.
In Table III, the disease hazard was ve times as high in the exposed as in the unexposed

was apparent for the exponential incidence function or Cox’s regression models with age as
the time-scale (model 5). For the single and piecewise Weibull distributions, bias was still
large with model 1 for the eect of all three covariates Z1 , Z2 and Z3 , and its magnitude
was virtually the same as for  = 0. For the analysis of the time-dependent covariate Z3 ,
substantial bias persisted with models 2–4, with perhaps a slightly higher magnitude than for
 = 0 with models 2 and 3. Of note, bias became signicant with model 2 for the analysis of
the highly age-associated covariate Z2 for both the single and piecewise Weibull distributions,
and for the analysis of the moderately age-associated covariate Z1 for the piecewise Weibull
distribution only. Statistical power to detect an association between disease risk and all three
covariates Z1 ; Z2 and Z3 was 100 per cent with all models because of the large sample size
(i.e. over 2500 events on average).

4. EXAMPLE
We rst assessed whether our data were in agreement with condition 1, that is h0 (a) =
c exp( a) at any age W = a, by examining a plot of the Nelson–Aalen estimate of the cumulative hazard of breast cancer in the E3N cohort as a function of age (Figure 3). This
plot provided some evidence against condition 1 and the possible change of incline observed
around age 60 years appeared consistent with a two-piece distribution, such as a piecewise
exponential or a piecewise Weibull distribution. The maximum likelihood estimate of shape
parameter  for a single Weibull distribution suggested a departure from an exponential distribution with ˆ = 2:13 (95 per cent condence interval = 1.83–2.42). Allowing a two-piece
Weibull distribution (¡ 60; ¿60 years), the  estimates were found greater than 1 for younger
ages and less than 1 for older ages.
Table IV shows the estimated log relative hazards of postmenopausal status, as a xed
(top part) and time-dependent (bottom part) covariate, from the ve Cox models of analysis used in the simulation study. The xed covariate menopausal status at recruitment is
intrinsically dependent on age at recruitment, postmenopausal status becoming increasingly
likely with increasing age. Indeed, this covariate showed an even stronger association with
age at recruitment in our example than covariate Z2 in our simulations, with observed percentages of postmenopausal women at recruitment of 4.5, 19.7, 66.1, 96.3 and 99.7 per cent
for age groups 40–44, 45–49, 50–54, 55–59 and 60+ years, respectively. From Cox’s model

2–5), being postmenopausal at recruitment appeared to be associated with a decrease in breast
cancer risk, the eect being slightly more pronounced when age was used as the time-scale

When the model is uncontrolled for the eect of age (model 1), menopausal status at
recruitment may act as a proxy for age at recruitment, which in turn is strongly determined
by birth cohort, as recruitment took place in a relatively short period of calendar time. Because
breast cancer incidence rates do not vary monotonically with age, the increasing rates up to age
60 years may tend to counterbalance the decreasing rates after age 60, possibly leading to the
null association we observed with model 1 between postmenopausal status at recruitment and
breast cancer risk. However, when model 1 was stratied on ve-year birth cohort intervals,
the log relative hazard estimate of postmenopausal status notably changed from +0:011 to
−0:331 and became much closer to estimates from models 2–5. For models using time-onstudy as the time-scale and controlling the eect of age (models 2–4), women postmenopausal
at a given age are compared for their risk of breast cancer after some length of follow-up with
women who were still premenopausal at the same age. Hence, the reduction in risk that we
observed is consistent with the well-known protective eect of an earlier age at menopause on
breast cancer risk (see Reference [19] for instance). When age is used as the time-scale (model
5), postmenopausal women are compared to premenopausal women for their risk of breast
cancer at a certain age without regards to their age at recruitment. Postmenopausal women at
recruitment being likely to belong to earlier birth cohorts, we veried in the E3N cohort that
breast cancer incidence rates tended to be lower in earlier compared to later birth cohorts at
each age interval. Therefore, the log relative hazard of postmenopausal status at recruitment,
which was greater in magnitude with model 5, may encompass birth cohort eect in addition
to the eect of an earlier age at menopause. Besides, stratifying on one-year birth cohort
intervals, the log relative hazard estimate from model 5 became slightly closer to estimates
from models 2–4 (−0:338), whereas it remained virtually unchanged when stratifying on
ve-year birth cohort intervals (−0:373).
Such results appear to be in line with those from our simulations in Table III for covariate
Z2 and Weibull or piecewise Weibull distributions. Indeed, we observed a 0.386 dierence
between estimates from models 1 and 5 in the example, a value comprised between mean differences of 0.434 and 0.197 in simulations for the single and piecewise Weibull distributions,
respectively. Nonetheless, some caution in the interpretation of these results may be needed
since, contrary to the simulation study, Cox’s model with age as the time-scale may also be
misspecied. For instance, the assumption of proportional hazards appeared to be questionable,
with some evidence of crossing hazards early on and a possible increased dierence between
pre- and postmenopausal status at recruitment after age 60 years (Figure 4). However, one
could not reject the proportional hazards assumption on the time-on-study scale (Figure 4).
Since the log hazard estimate from model 5 and those from models 2–4 appear close, the
latter nding seems to indicate that the departure from the proportional hazards assumption
on the age scale did not incur large bias.
The bottom part of Table IV shows estimates for menopausal status considered as a timedependent covariate, thus not verifying condition 2 either. This covariate is very similar by
construction to covariate Z3 in our simulations, because Z3 was derived from the distribution
of age at menopause in the E3N cohort. In the example data, postmenopausal status appeared
associated with increased breast cancer risk with model 1, and to a lesser extent with model
2. No such association was apparent from models 3, 4 or 5. Hence, menopausal status did
not seem to have an eect upon that of age on breast cancer risk. The reason might be that,
due to the diculty to assess age at menopause precisely, menopausal status during follow-up
mainly acts as a proxy for age.

the dierence between estimates from models 3 and 5 was less marked in the example than
in the simulation study.

5. DISCUSSION
We showed that bias can occur in Cox’s regression analysis of epidemiologic cohort data
when time-on-study is used as the time-scale instead of age, even when age is adjusted for
(or stratied on). Such bias can be relatively severe in case of substantial association between
age and the covariate under study, especially for time-dependent covariates such as menopausal
status. Therefore, using time-on-study as the time-scale can be misleading in such situations
and should be discouraged. These results are in agreement with reports of similarly discrepant
ndings with the time-on-study and age scales obtained for xed covariates strongly associated
with age, from either limited simulations [5] or a few data examples [4, 14].
Moreover, our simulations showed that bias can occur even for covariates independent of
age. Independence between the covariate of interest and age at recruitment is therefore not a
sucient condition for obtaining unbiased estimates in Cox’s regression models with time-onstudy as the time-scale, even when age is adjusted for, contrary to Korn et al.’s assertion [4].
However, although signicant bias was observed after adjustment for age in our simulations,
its magnitude was not large and was mainly noticeable for mid-range censoring percentages,
a situation much more typical of clinical studies than epidemiologic cohort studies which
are usually characterized by heavy censoring (e.g. in the range 90–100 per cent). Hence,
large bias is unlikely in the analysis of covariates independent of age in epidemiologic cohort
studies, as long as age is adjusted for, so that Korn et al.’s claim is veried in practice. The
same conclusion holds when age at recruitment is stratied on.
There can be several reasons why bias can occur when using time-on-study rather than
age as the time-scale, depending on whether the covariate of interest is associated with age
or not. First, for covariates associated with age, age can act as a confounder of the association between these covariates and the risk of disease occurrence, unless age is unrelated to
disease occurrence. Indeed, whereas no bias was found in simulations with constant disease
hazard with age (i.e. under an exponential distribution), even for the follow-up-dependent
Cox model unadjusted for age (model 1), upward confounding bias was observed with model
1 in simulations under the single Weibull distribution considered for all three age-associated
covariates Z1 , Z2 and Z3 . Such bias could be expected in view of the positive associations
of age with these covariates and disease hazard. In simulations under the piecewise Weibull
distribution considered, with disease hazard increasing up to age 60 years and then decreasing,
we still observed upward confounding bias with model 1, possibly because of the dominant
weight of the 40–59 year age interval, in which more person-years accumulated than in the
60–75 year age interval. Of note, in simulations under the null hypothesis, for both single and
piecewise Weibull distributions, we found that upward confounding bias could cause spurious
associations between disease risk and any of the three age-associated covariates considered.
While omitting age altogether can yield confounding bias, residual confounding bias is
still possible if age is included but its eect is misspecied. As for confounding bias, age
would not act as a residual confounder, however, if not associated with disease hazard. Accordingly, in our simulations, we did not observe any bias under the exponential distribution
considered, whether age was adjusted for in a continuous (model 2) or a categorical (model

3) manner, or stratied on (model 4). The lack of bias with model 2 could also be expected from Korn et al.’s formal proof about exponential family distributions [4] to which
the exponential distribution belongs. On the contrary, in simulations under single and piecewise Weibull distributions, we observed upward residual confounding bias with models 2–4,
but of markedly smaller magnitude than confounding bias with model 1. Bias in models 2
and 3 may result from the misspecication of the age eect if the parametric assumptions
on the relationship between age and disease hazard on the time-on-study scale are not veried. Indeed, when age is included as a continuous covariate in a follow-up-dependent Cox
model (as in model 2), a log-linear relationship between age and disease hazard is assumed,
whereas including age in ve-year intervals (as in model 3) implies a constant multiplicative eect on the hazard rate by age group. Other forms of age adjustment, for instance
fractional polynomial or spline regression [20], which we did not investigate here, might decrease bias but would not be expected to eliminate it completely, as long as they rely on
parametric assumptions for the age eect. Upon stratifying on age at inclusion (as in model
4), no parametric assumptions are needed on the relationship between age and disease hazard; however, ve-year age intervals may be too large to allow an eective control of the
eect of age.
Second, for covariates independent of age, confounding bias is no more an issue but other
types of bias, specic to non-linear regression models such as Cox’s models, may occur, due
to the omission of age or model misspecication. Omitting a prognostic factor independent of
the covariate of interest (i.e. age in our case) has been shown to result in biased estimates of
the covariate eect toward the null, in situations with right censoring only [6–13]. This nding
was illustrated by our observation of underestimated relative hazard for the age-independent
covariate Z0 with model 1. Furthermore, it has been reported that this underestimation may
lead to a loss of power to detect an association of the covariate of interest with disease risk,
despite a small gain in precision [9, 13]. In our simulations, the sample size was such that
power was always estimated at 100 per cent, even in cases of strong underestimation, but a
limited gain in precision was suggested with model 1 compared to models 2 and 3 in some
instances. Also consistent with results from studies on covariate omission [8, 9], we observed
that  = 0 was a sucient condition for the absence of bias and that bias magnitude increased
with that of . In the case of an exponential distribution, no bias occurred, as expected because
of the lack of association between the omitted factor age and disease risk [7–9]. Finally, we
observed that bias magnitude decreased with increasing censoring percentages higher than 50
per cent, again in agreement with previous ndings [11].
Mismodelling age would be expected to have a similar consequence, yet to a lesser extent,
as omitting age on the estimated eect of an independent covariate. Two studies [7, 13] considered estimating or testing the log relative hazard associated with the exposed category of
a dichotomous covariate T (e.g. treatment group) in the presence of an independent continuous covariate X . Fitting T along with a dichotomized version of X was shown to result in
downward bias in estimating the log relative hazard associated with the exposed level of T
[13], and to a loss of power in assessing the association between T and disease risk [7, 13].
Accordingly, we veried in additional simulations under Weibull distributions that adjusting
for age dichotomized with respect to the median age at inclusion in the E3N study (i.e.
¿48 vs¡48 years) in Cox’s models with time-on-study as the time-scale yielded downward
bias in estimating the log relative hazard associated with Z0 , as with model 1 though with a
smaller magnitude (data not shown).

Other forms of model misspecication could explain the overestimation we observed in
estimating the log relative hazard associated with covariate Z0 with models 2–4, such as
departures from the proportional hazards assumption on the time-on-study scale for either
the covariate of interest, Z0 , or (in models 2 and 3) the adjustment covariate, age. Several
authors examined the issue of non-proportionality in Cox’s regression models under a closed
cohort structure and found that incorrectly assuming proportional hazards may yield biased
estimates of associations. From simulations, Schemper [21] observed downward (respectively,
upward) bias in case of converging (respectively, diverging) hazards. Lagakos and Schoenfeld
[7] showed that the loss of power is expected to be moderate in such situations, and larger in
case of crossing hazards because hazard ratios before and after crossing can then compensate
each other and make the eect of the covariate disappear. Departures from the proportional
hazards assumption on the time-on-study scale for the adjustment covariate age could inuence
the assessment of the association of the covariate of interest with disease risk and cause bias
in an unpredictable direction.
Besides age, calendar period and birth cohort may play a role in disease incidence. Because
at most two eects among age, calendar period and birth cohort eects are uniquely identiable
in longitudinal analyses, possible options are to use Cox’s regression model with age as the
time-scale stratied on birth cohort [4, 14] or calendar period (using time-dependent strata)
[3], or Cox’s model with time-on-study as the time-scale stratied on birth cohort [22]. All
these models should be equivalent to one another since they make no parametric assumptions
on the eects of age, calendar period and birth cohort, but exact equivalence may depend on
the precision of the strata used. In the analysis of epidemiologic cohort data, consideration of
birth cohort eect in addition to age eect may be greatly relevant for correct interpretation
[4, 14], as was illustrated with our example data.
Although age appears to be the most natural time variable in most situations, other choices
such as time since rst full-term pregnancy [23], duration of employment [3], etc., may be
equally or more relevant in some situations. In such cases, it might be worth analysing
data with several time-scales in an exploratory fashion. Because subjects are rarely followed up from their birth in epidemiologic studies, the choice of time-scale in these studies most often requires prior identication of the time point when subjects rst become
at risk for the disease of interest. On the contrary, the choice of time-scale is usually
straightforward in clinical studies, with the inclusion coinciding with the beginning of the
at-risk period in most cases. However, it may sometimes be more problematic, if age is
itself the prognostic factor of interest. For instance, based on the SEER data, Cheung et
al. [24] found that a younger age at breast cancer diagnosis was associated with higher
mortality when they used Cox’s model with age as the time-scale, whereas they found
the opposite with time since diagnosis as the time-scale. It should be noted that formal
statistical procedures have been derived for selecting an optimal time-scale or combination of time-scales [25], which may prove useful when there are several plausible
time-scales.
In conclusion, we strongly recommend to use age (or another meaningful time variable if
applicable) rather than time-on-study as the time-scale for the analysis of epidemiologic cohort
studies. Presently, as most usual statistical softwares allow the analysis of left-truncated data
[26], there is no practical impediment to using Cox’s regression with age as the time-scale.
Moreover, our results suggest that a critical review of ndings from published studies which
used Cox’s regression with time-on-study as the time-scale may be warranted, particularly

for those studies with covariates of interest which were either time-dependent or strongly
associated with age.
