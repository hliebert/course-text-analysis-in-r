A GENERALIZATION OF SAMPLING WITHOUT
REPLACEMENT FROM A FINITE UNIVERSE*
D. G. HORVITZt AND D. J. THOMPSON
Iowa State College
This paper presents a general technique for the treatment

of samples drawn without replacement from finite universes
when unequal selection probabilities are used. Two sampling
schemes are discussed in connection with the problem of determining optimum selection probabilities according to the
information available in a supplementary variable. Ad-

mittedly, these two schemes have limited application. They

should prove useful, however, for the first stage of sampling
with multi-stage designs, since both permit unbiased estimation of the sampling variance without resorting to additional
assumptions.
INTRODUCTION

W HEN sampling a finite universe in which we can identify the individual elements, we are free to assign in a completely arbitrary
manner the probability of selecting an element on any particular draw.
By appropriate assignment of the selection probabilities it is possible
to reduce considerably the sampling variances of unbiased sample

estimates over those obtained when sampling with equal probabilities
throughout.
The possibility of using unequal probabilities for selecting the sample
elements from the universe as a means of increasing precision perhaps
received its first impetus for applied sampling from Hansen and

Hurwitz [2] in 1943. They introduced the selection of primary
(in a subsampling scheme) with probabilities proportionate to some

measure of their size and presented the appropriate theory. Their
sampling scheme was confined (when sampling without replacement)
to samples of one primary unit per stratum, however, the theory not

having been extended beyond this point. More recently, Midzuno [6]
has generalized the Hansen and Hurwitz approach to sampling a combination of n elements of the universe with probability proportionate

to some measure of size of the combination. Madow [5] has made
some contributions to the theory of the systematic selection of several
clusters with probability proportionate to a measure of size.

Research in the theory of sampling for surveys has been concerned
with the development of more efficient sampling systems, the system

including both the sample design and the method of estimation. One
sampling system is said to be more efficient than another if the variance or mean square error of the estimate with the first system is less

than that of the second, provided the cost of obtaining the data and
results is the same for both. The development of stratified, multi-stage,
multiphase, cluster, systematic, and other sample designs beyond
simple or unrestricted random sampling, as well as alternative methods of estimation, have all resulted in increased efficiency in specific

circumstances. As indicated above, the appropriate use of variable
probabilities for the selection of the sample elements can lead to gains

in efficiency over systems using equal probabilities of selection.
It is well known that if samples of size one are drawn with prob-

abilities proportionate to the exact measure of the characteristic

under observation, unbiased estimates of means or totals for the population exist which have zero sampling error. Similarly, Midzuno provides an unbiased estimator for his design which has zero sampling
error when the samples are drawn with probabilities proportionate to
the total measure of the elements in each for the characteristic observed.

Since in practical situations the values of the characteristic under study
are not known in advance, the problem arises of determining the selection probabilities (from any additional information available) which
have optimum propelties, i.e. maximize the efficiency. Midzuno [6]
and Hansen and Hurwitz [3] have both considered this problem with
some success.

A limitation of the Hansen and Hurwitz scheme is that an unbiased
estimate of the sampling variance of their estimator cannot be obtained
from the sample elements. This difficulty appears to exist in Midzuno's
system as well, except in the trivial case of equal probability for each
sample combination.

The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it provides a general

method for dealing with sampling without replacement from a finite
universe when variable probabilities of selection are used for the elements remaining prior to each draw. An unbiased linear estimator for
the population total of the characteristic measured is given, as well as
the sampling variance of this estimator. An unbiased estimator for the
sampling variance is also given. This is for a one-stage design. An extension of the use of this method for two-stage sampling is presented.
Second, it examines and discusses some of the problems arising in
the practical application of sampling with variable selection probabili-

ties. In this connection, two sampling schemes, for samples of size two,
using unequal selection probabilities are presented. Although general
use of these schemes is limited because of the small sample size, they

should have wide application for the first stage of sampling with
stratified two-stage designs. Either of the two schemes permits an un-

biased estimate of the sampling variance to be made from the sample
data without resorting to additional assumptions.
SAMPLING WITH ARBITRARY PROBABILITIES OF SELECTION

Let the universe, U, consist of N elements ul, U2, . .
of size n is to be drawn without replacement using arbitrary probabilities of selection for each draw. We denote the probability of selection
associated with the ith element of the universe prior to the first draw

by pi, (i = 1, 2, , N), where
N

Pi, _ 0, E pi, = 1.
This, in a sense, defines a probability distribution (of selection) for
the elements of the universe for samples of size one. We are sampling
without replacement so that prior to each succeeding draw we must

define a new probability distribution for the remaining elements. These
may be based on the initial probabilities or, in fact, can be a completely unrelated set. For the mth draw we shall designate the prob-

abilities of selection by pim where, as above,
Pim > 0 > Pim= 1

but the summation now extends only over the N-m+1 remaining
elements.' We will denote the n sets of selection probabilities by

(1)

{Pim},

m=1,2,***,n.

Knowing the probability distributions used at each draw, it is pos-

sible to compute the a priori probability that the ith element (i.e. ui)
will be included in a sample of size n. This probability will be desig-

nated notationally by P(ui). It is well known that

replacement which arises when the elements once selected have probability zero of being chosen on any
succeeding draw.

rather than one since we are not summing probabilities of mutually
exclusive events, except for samples of size one.

There are (N) different samples when n elements are drawn withn

out replacement from a finite universe of N elements (assuming that
at each stage of the draw all remaining undrawn elements have a
probability greater than zero of being selected). Consider now the
number of possible samples when the order of draw is taken into account. Since each different sample could occur in n! different orders

there are n! (N) =S possible samples, considering order. Denote by
sn(s=1 . * S) the sth such sample of size n. The probability that
Sn will be drawn is given by the product of the probabilities of selection
of the elements in the sample considering the order of the draw. Thus,

if sn contains the elements ui, uj, * , ut drawn in that order, then

(3) Pr (Sn) = Pi&i2 *P n
The probability, P(ui), of including element ui in the sample plays
the fundamental role in the theory developed in the following sections.
For a sample of size n, P(ui) reduces to a summation of the prob-

abilities associated with the n! (N 1 l)=S(i) samples that contain
Notationally, we have

each draw naturally arises. We will restrict ourselves here to using an
unbiased linear estimator of a certain class for the population total of
the characteristic X.
Actually a number of subclasses of linear estimators exist when

sampling a finite universe without replacement. For example, for
estimating (from a sample of size n) the population total of X, i.e.
N

T = Xi,
i=l

we could consider using either
n

T1 = a ajixi,
where ai (i= 1, * , n) is a constant to be used as a weight for the
element selected on the ith draw; or
n

T2= >E ii,
i=l

where f3i (i= 1, * , N) is a constant to be used as a weight for the ith
element whenever it is selected for the sample; or
T3 = 8n ( Xi)
i=l

8n

where 'Ysn is a constant to
is selected. It should be noted that the a coefficients are independent

be

of the particular sample that is selected. However, the i# and y coeffi
cients, although known constants for a specified sampling procedure,
depend on the particular sample selected.
It is the usual procedure, whenever a linear function of n independent random variables is desired as an estimator of some population
parameter, to choose the one which has the smallest variance among
those that are unbiased. The resulting estimator is then classed as the
best linear unbiased estimator. We have indicated above only three
of the possible subclasses of linear estimators of T when sampling a
finite universe without replacement. The determination of the unbiased estimator which has minimum variance within each of these
subclasses is straightforward. The general solution to the problem of
determining the best linear unbiased estimator, however, when
sampling a finite universe without replacement and with arbitrary
probabilities of selection has not been considered by the authors. We
observe here, if

(i) there is only one-stage of sampling,
(ii) the individual elements of the universe can be identified in advance,

(iii) information on any supplementary variables for use in the estimation process is lacking, and

(iv) there is no advance knowledge of the values of the characteristic
to be measured,

that a general solution is lacking even in the case of equal probabilities

of selection. In connection with this remark, although it can be easily
shown, when sampling with equal probabilities of selection for each

draw, that the a's, O3's, and y's are all equal to N/n for the best line
unbiased estimators of T for each of the three subclasses, this is certainly not sufficient to claim

as the "best" among all possible linear unbiased estimators of T.
We2 will restrict ourselves here to the subclass of linear estimators for

Using the results obtained in the section on expected values the

variance of T, say V(TFi), follows readily. Thus,
V(T) = E(T- T)2

This formula applies only when every element has a positive probability
of inclusion in the sample, however (i.e. P(ui) >0 for all i).

An unbiased estimator of the variance of T in the general sampling
procedure is also readily obtainable, provided n is greater than one.
Thus,

(10) V(~) n 12 1-P(ui) n P(uiuj) - P(ui)P(u1)

(1 0) V (T) = E 2i p2(U9 ) + E xixj ) _ U)

Again, this formula is restricted to those sampling schemes which yield
positive probabilities of inclusion for every element and every pair of

elements (i.e. both P(ui) and P(uiuj) greater than zero for all i and j).
Alternatively, we may write (10) in the form
n X 2. n X,Xi

(11) rV(T) = T2 - 2 P Xix
If an unbiased estimate of the population mean is desired, it is suffi-

cient to divide the unbiased estimator of the population total, (6), by
N. The sampling variance of this estimator is the same as (8) except
for an additional factor of 1/N2.
APPLICATION TO KNOWN SAMPLING DESIGNS

The general nature of this approach to sampling a finite universe
without replacement will be illustrated by considering the estimator

and its sampling variance, as derived in the preceding section, for
simple random, systematic, and stratified random sampling procedures.
With simple random sampling or equal probabilities of selection for
the elements remaining prior to each draw, we have
n

P(ui) = N (i =1, 2, .. * * N)
N

n(n-1)

P(uivu) = n(n (i,j=1, 2, , N,i# i).

Substitution of these inclusion probabilities in form
yields the estimator

with sampling variance

V(T N(N-n) N (X T 2

In addition, the estimator for the variance of T in the ge
formula (10), reduces to

V (T) =- ) xi- -N 9
These derived expressions agree with the formulas usually prescribed for the respective quantities when the sample is selected at
random without replacement.

To illustrate the application of the general results to systematic
samples, we consider the simplified case of a universe of N=kn ele-

ments. A systematic sample is obtained by selecting every kth element following the choice of a random starting point among the elements numbered 1 through k. The measured value, of the characteristic
of interest, associated with the jth element in the ith possible sample is
denoted by Xij.
It follows readily that

P(uis)= k
for all i and j,

P(Uijui,i,)=
for i=i', j#j', and

P(ui3.liuip) = 0
for all other pairs of elements. Formula (6) again yields the usual

of the usual variance formula for systematic samples. (See, for example,
L. H. Madow [4]). Since certain pairs of elements have no chance of

being included together in a sample with this systematic design,
formula (10) cannot be used to estimate the sampling variance of T
from the sample data.
The. variance formula (8), left in its expanded form, provides an inter-

esting method for examining the conditions under which one sampling
system will be more efficient than another disregarding costs. To
examine the efficiency of a systematic sample versus a random sample
we note that the respective variance formulas differ only in the middle
term of (8). Thus a systematic sample will be more efficient (the particular estimator chosen will have a smaller variance for systematic

samples than for random samples) if

SAMPLING WITHOUT REPLACEMENT FROM FINITE UNIVERSES 673

Essentially, then, a systematic sample will be more efficient than a
random sample if the variation between the possible systematic
samples is less than the average variation within the possible samples.
It should be noted in particular that (12) is exactly equivalent to the

well-known condition of an intraclass (intrasample, in this case) correlation coefficient less than -1/(N-1) for an efficient systematic

sample relative to a random sample. Further examination of (12) leads
rapidly to several of the other known conditions for gains with a systematic sample.
When the universe elements have been classified into K strata and a
random sample selected from each stratum, substitution of the inclu-

sion probabilities for individual elements and pair of elements in (6)
and (8) again yields the usual formulas for the appropriate linear un-

biased estimator and its sampling variance. If uij denotes the jth element in the ith stratum, Ni the number of elements in the ith stratum,
and ni the number of elements selected for the sample from that
stratum, the inclusion probabilities are

for i=i', j=j', and

P(jusi,it)= P(uij)P(ui'i') = n
for all j and j', if i'.

Whereas the above results point out that for the schemes considered

the possible estimators Tl and T2 are equivalent, this will not be true
in general. It should be noted that for each of these schemes the prob-

ability of including a particular element in a sample is the same either
for all the elements of the universe or for all the elements of the same
sub-universe.
EXTENSION TO A TWO-STAGE SAMPLING DESIGN

The extension of the use of arbitrary probabilities of selection for

each draw to designs involving more than one stage has been examined
for a special case only. The universe now consists of K primary sampling

units. Let Xij be the value of some characteristic X of the jth subsampling unit of the ith primary sampling unit. The population total

is to be estimated from a sample of k primary
units to be drawn from the ith primary unit if it is in the sample. The
primary units are drawn without replacement using arbitrary probabilities of selection for each draw. An over-all sampling rate, say t,
is specified in advance and the ni determined from the relation

(14)

k),

where P(ui) now denotes the a priori probability that the ith primary
unit will be included in a sample of k such units. The subsampling
units are to be drawn without replacement with equal probabilities of
selection for those remaining prior to each draw, i.e. at random. This
sampling procedure is entirely analogous to that specified by Hansen

and Hurwitz [2 ] (ignoring area substratification) when a single primary
unit is drawn with probability proportionate to its estimated size.

One difficulty that arises with this scheme concerns the ni as determined by (15). In most practical applications this relation will not
yield integral subsampling sizes. We will neglect the bias introduced by

choosing the closest integral value for ni in what follows. It should
also be noted that the Ni need not be known in advance of the primary
unit selection stage of the draw.

Since every subsampling unit will have the same chance of being included in the sample, it follows that

SOME ASPECTS OF THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE THEORY

The remaining sections of this paper will be devoted to examining

some aspects of the problems arising in connection with attempts to
utilize the preceding theory in practical applications. To simplify the

exposition, attention will be confined to a one stage sampling scheme;
however, various extensions of the results to multi-stage stratified
designs are evident.

expressions for the variance and sample estimates of the variance, it

will be noticed that it is the quantities P(ui) and P(uiuj) that can be
controlled by the sampler. Assume that a variable Y reasonably correlated with X is known for each element of the universe, and that the
sampler wishes to utilize the information in Y in assigning the selec-

tion probabilities (1), so that the resulting P(ui) and P(uiuj) will lead
to a reduction in variance. The three main problems that arise in this
connection consist of

(i) determining the quantities P(uiuj) that will minimize the variance (9) (specifying the P(uiuj) determines the P(ui) since

,j P(uiuj) = (n- 1)P(ui), as may be easily verified),

(ii) defining the sets (1) to achieve the P(uiuj) thus determined, and
(iii) investigating the conditions required on the relationship between Y and X to obtain gains in efficiency over sampling systems employing the information in Y in alternative ways.

These three problems are not independent and a general solution has
not been reached by the authors. Some progress has been made in par-

ticular cases, however, and it is hoped that a discussion of these cases
will provoke interest and stimulate others to investigate sampling systems of the type here considered.

Considering first the problem of assigning the P(uiuj), as a first approximation to an "optimum" assignment, we may require only that

by assuming strict proportionality between X and Y and noting that

(6) is then identically T. From examination of (9), it appears that the

assignment of the P(uiuj) (in terms of the Yi) that leads to minimum
variance depends upon the joint distribution of X and Y. This complicates the problem. In the examples discussed in a later section, however,
it will be demonstrated that a substantial reduction in variance can be
achieved by an assignment of the type indicated in (18).
The problem of determining the sets of selection probabilities (1)

that will yield preassigned "optimum" values of P(uiuj), or P(ui)
as in (18) above, can be illustrated by a sample example. Suppose a
sample of size 2 is to be drawn without replacement from the universe

of 6 elements given in Table 1 in such a manner that P(ui)

must be defined, so that when the n draws have been performed ac-

cording to these sets, the probability that ui will be included in the
sample will be the assigned probability P(ui). The notation adopted
for the sets of selection probabilities is not entirely satisfactory since it
does not indicate the dependence of the set used for selecting the mth
element in the sample on the results of the previous m - 1 draws. In
Table 1, columns 5 and 6, this dependence is explicitly indicated by

using the notation commonly employed for a conditional probability.
Thus,

It may be easily verified that the selection probabilities defined in

columns 4, 5, and 6 of Table 1 do achieve the inclusion probabilities in
column 3. The solution indicated is one of an infinity of solutions and
was chosen primarily for its simplicity. The authors are not aware of

general methods for examining the consistency of systems of equations

of the type used in obtaining columns 4, 5, and 6 or of finding simultaneous positive solutions when they exist. For the solution given

P(uiuj) = 0 for i#=3, 4, 5, 6, and formula (10) is therefore n
plicable.

It should be noted that the P(ui) are probabilities satisfying

so that if the "measures of size" are such that for any element, say ut

the quantity nYt/ E&=,N Yi is greater than unity, no method of drawing the sample exists which will give P(ut)/ Zi=IN Yi. This situation
can be obviated in various ways (stratification, subdivision of the elements of the universe, etc.) so that it need cause no difficulty.
A secondary consideration of practical importance in defining the sets

pim.} by the general method indicated above is that particular solu-

tions may not facilitate the computation of the quantities P(uiuj) re-

quired for estimating the variance (10). To calculate this expression the

quantities P(uiuj) must be determined for the (2) combinations of th
sample elements. For n of any considerable size the direct calcula-

tion of the P(uiuj) by summing the probabilities associated with the
samples containing ui and ui is impractical. It would thus seem advisable to restrict further the choice of selection schemes to those

schemes that permit ready calculation of P(uiuj).
A selection scheme that obviates the problem of explicitly defining

the set (1) yet satisfies (18) is mentioned by Goodman and Kish [1].
The N universe elements are listed in a random order and their measures of size are cumulated. A systematic selection of n elements
from a random start is then made on the cumulation so that

P(ut) =nYt Ei.1N Yi. This selection is easily performe

does not appear to be any simple way to determine the P(uiuj).
Sampling Scheme 1

A method of defining the set pim.} that yields an exact solution

under certain conditions can be developed in the following way.
Consider drawing a sample of n elements from a universe of N ele-

ments without replacement, where the first element is selected accord-

ing to the set pi,, (i= 1, 2, . . . , N) Ei=1N pil= 12 pil>0. At the sec

ond and all remaining (n-1) stages of the draw equal probabilities

are assigned to the elements remaining, i.e. the set Pi2 consists of N -1

equal elements 1/(N- 1), the set pi,, N-2 equal elements 1/(N-2),

etc.3 By simple combinatorial analysis we find that

3 Midzuno suggested using this scheme for drawing the sample in connection with his sampling
system on a recent visit to the Statistical Laboratory, Iowa State College. It may be mentioned that

with this method of drawing, each of the possible (N) different samples has a probability of
selected proportional to the total of the measures of size for the elements in the combination, which is
desirable in his system.

In a particular case when the P(ui) have been assigned such that one or
more of the inequalities P(ui) < (n- 1)/(N- 1) are satisfied, the corresponding solutions of (21) will be negative. This restriction is rather
severe, in general, and limits the usefulness of this method. For a small
sample size, however, the method may be satisfactory, as will be demonstrated in the example that follows, and approximate solutions based
upon it for larger sample sizes can be obtained easily. For the case

when all solutions of (21) are positive with P(ui) =nYi/ E,=,N Yi, the
first element would be drawn according to the set of solutions of (21)
and equal probabilities would be used for the remaining draws.
Sampling Scheme 2

There are undoubtedly many other ways of defining sets of selection
probabilities such that condition (18) will be satisfied approximately.
To be practical, the necessary computations should remain simple,
however. At the same time, although such schemes yield only an ap-

proximate solution to the preassigned "optimum" values of the P(ui),
they should include exact expressions for the actual values of these

quantities and for the P(uiuj) as well. The scheme proposed here
satisfies these requirements but is restricted to samples of size 2. It may

lead to a better approximation to the desired P(ui) when the condition for an exact solution with Sampling Scheme 1 is not satisfied.
The particular scheme suggested here requires the prior determina-

tion only of the set pit, (i = 1, 2, , N); that is the set of selection
probabilities to be used on the first draw. The set to be usad for the

second draw depends on the first element selected. Thus, if element u
is selected on the first draw, then

defines the set of selection probabilities Pi2, (i = 1, 2, * * , N). In practice the second element may be selected after adjusting the selection
probabilities used on the first draw or the same set may be used
throughout, the selection process continuing until two different ele-

ments have been chosen. Since only the set of selection probabilities
for the first draw needs to be determined in advance, the subscript indicating the draw will be dropped.
If a sample of size 2 is to be drawn using one set of selection prob-

abilities and with replacement, then the probability that element ui will
be selected only once in the two draws is 2pi(1 -pi). If the conditions
are such that sampling without replacement is not much different than
sampling with replacement, this probability will be approximately
equal to P(ui), the inclusion probability for sampling without replacement. This suggests that a set of selection probabilities which will
lead to an approximation of the desired P(ui) with the prescribed
sampling procedure may be determined from the solution to the system
of equations

where, of course, the common coefficient 2 may be cancelled. Again, the

In practice, a satisfactory solution to this system may be obtained by
solving each of the N quadratic equations separately, taking the smaller
of the two roots. Since the selection probabilities must sum to unity,

a simple adjustment is then made by dividing each of the pi obtained
in this manner by their sum. This method was used in the example
which follows where it proved quite adequate. It should be noted that
this procedure for solving the system (22) breaks down if any of the

desired P(ui) > ' since the solutions for the particular quadratic equations will then be imaginary.
The accuracy of whole method depends on the original assumption
that a formula based on sampling with replacement will be adequate
even though the sampling is without replacement. Although no detailed investigation has been made on this point, it appears that for N
at least as large as 10 and the desired P(ui) not dominated entirely by
one or two elements reasonable success will result.
One additional point is necessary. Whatever the set of selection
probabilities adopted with this sampling procedure, the exact formulas

for the P(ui) and P(uiu1) are

Example:

the data being given in columns 1 to 3 in Table 2. These data are taken

from a survey conducted by the Statistical Laboratory of Iowa State
College. The estimated number of households (column (3)) was obtained by a team of observers who drove through the portion of the

city of Ames represented by these 20 blocks and made rapid eyeestimates of the number of households on each block.
We shall consider drawing a sample of 2 blocks with probability
proportionate to this measure of size (eye-estimated households) according to the two selection schemes previously developed. The exact
values which the selection schemes are designed to achieve are listed in

COMPARISONS OF EFFICIENCY (IGNORING COST)

A primary purpose of this paper has been to extend the theory of

finite sampling with unequal probabilities to permit unbiased estimation of the sampling error without resorting to additional assumptions.

As mentioned previously, however, it is of interest to com
tive effectiveness of using the supplementary quantitat
in alternative ways, e.g. stratification, other estimators
expressions for the relative efficiency of sampling syst
herein developed to alternative systems have as yet been obtained.
As indicative of the type of results obtainable when the relationship
between Y and X is one of approximate proportionality, the empirical
comparisons with a number of alternatives included in Table 3 are of
interest.

The quantity under estimate is the total number of households on the
20 blocks in Table 2. A sample of size 2 is considered. For this small

universe and sample size it was feasible to compute the exact variance
of the estimator employed in each sampling system directly from the
definition, so that, for example, the mean square error of the so called
"ratio estimate" (line 2, Table 3) is not the usual approximation.
For the sampling systems 3 and 4 the blocks are ranked according to

the measure of size Y, and the ten largest blocks were taken as stratum
1 with the remaining 10 in stratum 2. The systematic sample is also to

be considered as drawn from the blocks after ranking from large to
small. It is of interest to note that the "ratio estimate" used in sampling
system 2 is identical with the estimator in Midzuno's system (sampling

system 6), and that it is an unbiased estimator for his method of
selection.

The data presented in Table 3 are, of course, far from conclusive,

but they do indicate that substantial reductions in variance can be obtained through the use of unequal probabilities without forfeiting an
unbiased estimate of the sampling variance.
It is the opinion of the authors that the techniques suggested by this
paper may be of greatest utility in specialized enquiries where the char-

acteristics under measurement are few and related, or where selection
with unequal probability arises naturally. The estimator (6) from a
computational point of view is at a serious disadvantage when com-

pared with self-weighting estimators. The estimated variance (9) has
similar disadvantages when compared with designs that permit estima-

tion of error by the use of an analysis of variance or other simple technique. When an unbiased estimator of high precision and an unbiased

sample estimate of its variance are required, however, the sampling

system employing unequal probabilities, with the selection of two or
more units at each stage of sampling, may be particularly appropriate.
This is particularly true when the universe (at any stage) is small and
the alternative use of the information in Y is a ratio-estimator (based

on Y with equal probability selection) with its possible bias and unknown error.

A modified formulation of the theory in connection with the technique suggested by Hartley and Politz-Simmons [7] for the problem
of the "not-at-homes" in an interview survey is possible along the lines
suggested by this paper. It also appears that the technique of control
beyond stratification suggested by Goodman and Kish [1] is closely

related to the problem of the optimal assignment of the P(uiuj).
Finally, the possibility of employing the sampling systems considered
here in connection with "point sampling" is of considerable interest. By
"point sampling" we have reference to the selection of farms in an
agricultural survey by locating points at random on a map of the area
to be surveyed, and including as sample elements the farms within
whose boundaries the points happen to fall. (See, for example, F. Yates

[8].) It is clear that the size of the farms will be related to their probability of inclusion in the sample, and that unbiased estimates are

possible from samples drawn in this manner. The details for this case
and similar cases in other types of investigations remain to be work out.

in this problem and to Professor 0. Kempthorne and Dr. P. C. Tang
