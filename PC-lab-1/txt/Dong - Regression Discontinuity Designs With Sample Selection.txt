This article extends the standard regression discontinuity (RD) design to allow for sample selection or
missing outcomes. We deal with both treatment endogeneity and sample selection. Identification in this
article does not require any exclusion restrictions in the selection equation, nor does it require specifying
any selection mechanism. The results can therefore be applied broadly, regardless of how sample selection
is incurred. Identification instead relies on smoothness conditions. Smoothness conditions are empirically
plausible, have readily testable implications, and are typically assumed even in the standard RD design. We
first provide identification of the “extensive margin” and “intensive margin” effects. Then based on these
identification results and principle stratification, sharp bounds are constructed for the treatment effects
among the group of individuals that may be of particular policy interest, that is, those always participating
compliers. These results are applied to evaluate the impacts of academic probation on college completion
and final GPAs. Our analysis reveals striking gender differences at the extensive versus the intensive margin
in response to this negative signal on performance.

1. INTRODUCTION
One of the frequently encountered issues in empirical applications of regression discontinuity (RD) designs is the issue of
sample selection or missing outcomes. Intuitively, identification in the standard RD design relies on comparability of observations right above and right below the RD threshold (Hahn,
Todd, and van der Klaauw 2001; see also the discussion in
Dong 2016). Differential sample selection or missing outcomes
near the RD threshold may undermine such comparability and
hence the standard RD design is not valid. Recent empirical
studies highlighting this issue include Martorell and McFarlin (2011); McCrary and Royer (2011); Kim (2012) among
others.
McCrary and Royer (2011) estimated the impacts of female
education on fertility and infant health, using an RD design
based on the age-at-school-entry policy. Infant health is
observed only for those women who give birth, a selected sample where ample selection (the fertility decision) itself may
depend on women’s education. The selection bias is corrected
by controlling for the inverse Mills ratio (Heckman 1979). No
exclusion restriction is present in the selection equation. This
approach therefore relies entirely on the distributional assumption requiring the error term in the sample selection equation
and that in the outcome equation to follow a joint normal distribution. See also Martorell and McFarlin (2011) for a similar approach in their RD design, where sample selection arises
because earnings are not observed for those who do not work.
In addition, Kim (2012) estimated the effects of taking remedial courses on students’ performance in the subsequent main
courses. Only those who take and complete the subsequent
courses have available their performance measures. Following

a similar approach to Lee (2009), Kim (2012) provided bounds
on the treatment effects in his sharp RD design.
Various parametric, semi-parametric, or nonparametric
estimators exist for sample selection models with or without
endogeneity. See, for example, Heckman (1979, 1990), Ahn and
Powell (1993), Andrews and Schafgans (1998), Das, Newey,
and Vella (2003), and Lewbel (2007). See also Vella (1998)
for a survey on estimation of sample selection models. Existing sample selection corrections typically require exclusion
restrictions when not making functional form or distributional
assumptions. They may not work well in the above empirical
applications of RD designs due to the absence of plausible
exclusion restrictions.
This article extends the standard RD design to allow for differential sample selection or missing outcomes above or below
the RD cutoff. We focus on fuzzy designs, with sharp designs
following as a special case. We deal with both treatment endogeneity and sample selection. To our best knowledge, so far
there do not exist any studies that provide formal identification
of treatment effects in RD designs when sample selection results
in incomparability of observations near the RD threshold.
This article first provides point identification of the extensive
and intensive margin effects on the observed outcome distribution. Then based on these point identification results, bounds
are established on subgroup treatment effects. Identification

here does not require any exclusion restrictions in the selection
equation. The key assumptions are similar to those employed
in the standard RD design. Identification here also does not
require specifying any selection mechanism. Sample selection
can result from nonparticipation (e.g., dropout or unemployment), survey nonresponse, or other reasons (e.g, censoring by
death).
With nonnegative outcomes such as wage or health care utilization, the observed outcome for non-participants (those who
do not work or do not use health care) is zero. In contrast, when
the outcome is test score or other performance measure, the outcome for nonparticipants is truly not observed. Average treatment effects (ATEs) or local average treatment effects (LATEs)
in general are not identified in the first place. We explicitly consider the latter case where outcomes are missing nonrandomly,
but all our results apply to both cases.
Except for the standard RD literature, a few other studies
are related.1 Frandsen (2015) provided identification of treatment effects in a general model where the outcome is censored. Frandsen assumed random censoring, which we do not
assume here. Staub (2014) proposed a framework to decompose
the ATE for nonnegative outcomes, assuming that the LATE is
already identified. In contrast, here ATEs or LATEs are not point
identified, since we do not observe outcomes for nonparticipants, for example, test scores for dropouts. Staub also discussed
bounds on subpopulation-specific ATEs by restricting the sign
of the treatment effects, while we do not impose any sign restrictions.2 In addition, Chen and Flores (2014) provided bounds on
treatment effects in randomized experiments when both sample
selection and noncompliance are present. Unlike their bounds,
we provide sharp bounds.
We apply our identification results to evaluate the impacts
of academic probation on college completion and final GPAs,
using confidential data from a large Texas university. The proposed approach yields empirical evidence that is different from
that by the standard RD design. We show striking gender differences in response to this negative signal on performance.
Women are significantly more likely to drop out when placed
on probation. In contrast, probation has little impacts on men’s
dropout probability. Men seem to cope with this negative signal
by temporarily improving their GPAs to avoid being suspended.
The rest of the article proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides
identification of the extensive and intensive margin effects.
Section 3 provides sharp bounds on the treatment effect for
the always participating compliers. Also discussed is identifying characteristics of subgroups of compliers. Section 4
presents the empirical application. Section 5 concludes. The
1 Identification of the standard RD design has been discussed in Hahn, Todd, and

van der Klaauw (2001), Lee (2008), and Dong (2016). Inference was discussed
by Porter (2003), Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012), Calonico, Cattaneo, and
Titiunik (2014), Cattaneo, Frandsen, and Titiunik (2015), Otsu, Xu, and Matsushita (2015), and Feir, Lemieux, and Marmer (2016). See Cattaneo, Titiuni,
and Vazquez-Bare (2016) for a comparison of different inference approaches
for the standard RD design.
2 In particular, Staub (2014) discussed bounds under two alternative assumptions. The first assumption assumes that treatment effects are nonnegative for
everyone. The second assumption assume that treatment effects are nonnegative for switchers and have the same sign for always participants, and further
that one knows that ATE > 0 or ATE < 0.

main text focuses on bounds on average treatment effects.
Proofs and additional bounds on the corresponding quantile
treatment effects are provided in the Appendices.

2. IDENTIFICATION OF THE EXTENSIVE AND
INTENSIVE MARGIN EFFECTS
Let T be a binary treatment, so T = 1 when one is treated
and 0 otherwise. Let R be the so-called running or forcing
variable that determines the assignment of the treatment. At a
known threshold R = r0 , the treatment probability has a discrete
change. Let Y ∗ be the outcome of interest, which is observed
only for a non-randomly selected sample. Further let Y be the
observed outcome and S be a binary sample selection indicator,
so Y = Y ∗ if S = 1, and Y is missing if S = 0 . For example, T
can be an indicator for placement on academic probation, and R
can be the grade point average (GPA) used to determine placement on academic probation. Y ∗ can then be later performance,
which is observed only for students who do not drop out, so S
is an indicator for enrolling in school.
Given data on Y , S, T , and R, as a first step we are interested
in identifying the treatment effect on the sample selection probability, the extensive margin effect. We are also interested in
the intensive margin effect, that is, the treatment effect on the
observed outcome conditional on being selected into the sample. Here, we take advantage of the RD design to address both
treatment endogeneity and sample selection, so both the extensive and intensive margin effects are only identified locally at
the RD cutoff R = r0 among the so-called compliers.
Let Yt∗ for t = 1, 0, be an individual’s potential outcome
under treatment or no treatment, and Y ∗ = Y1∗ T + Y0∗ (1 − T ).
Similarly define St for t = 1, 0 as the potential sample selection
under treatment or no treatment.3 The observed selection status
is then S = S1 T + S0 (1 − T ). Identification in this article does
not require knowing the selection mechanism, so no selection
model or DGP for S is specified.
Let r be a value R can take on. All the following discussion applies to r ∈ (r0 − ε, r0 + ε) for some small ε > 0. Let
Z = 1(R ≥ r0 ), where 1(·) is an indicator function equal to 1
if the expression in the bracket is true and 0 otherwise. Given
R = r, define Tz (r), z = 1, 0, as an individual’s potential treatment status above or below the RD cutoff. For example, for an
individual with the observed running variable r > 0, T1 (r) is
her observed treatment, while T0 (r) is her counterfactual treatment if she were below the cutoff.4 We can then define four
types of individuals in a common probability space (, F, P)
(Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin 1996): always taker is the event
T1 (r) = T0 (r) = 1; never taker is the event T1 (r) = T0 (r) = 0;
complier is the event T1 (r) − T0 (r) = 1, and defier is the event
T1 (r) − T0 (r) = −1. For notational convenience, we simply use

3Y ∗ ≡ Y ∗ (t, S ) for t = 0, 1.

4 Assume T = h(R, V ) for unobservables V , which can be a vector. Without loss

of generality, one can write T = h1 (R, V )Z + h0 (R, V )(1 − Z). The function
hz (R, V ) for z = 0, 1 describes the treatment assignment below or above the
cutoff. Define then Tz (r) ≡ hz (r, V ) for z = 0, 1.

T1 and T0 to denote T1 (r) and T0 (r), respectively. Note that, however, just as potential outcomes can depend on the running variable, individual types can implicitly be functions of the running
variable.
Formally define the extensive margin effect as
E[S1 − S0 |R = r0 , C] and the intensive margin effect as
E[Y1∗ |S1 = 1, R = r0 , C] − E[Y0∗ |S0 = 1, R = r0 , C]. The extensive margin effect captures how the participation probability
differs under treatment or no treatment, while the intensive
margin effect captures how the observed outcomeis expected to
differ in these two counterfactual states of treatment.
Unlike the extensive margin effect, the intensive margin
effect in general does not represent a causal effect at the individual level. For example, the intensive margin effect typically
is different from the treatment effect for the always participating individuals, since participation is likely to change with
treatment. Instead, one may view the intensive margin effect
as a causal parameter from the distributional point of view.
This is similar to the distributional effects frequently estimated
in the program evaluation literature. The distributional effects
of a social program or treatment, represented by quantile
treatment effects(QTEs), generally do not capture individual
causal effects unless rank invariance or rank preservation holds
(see, e.g., the discussion in Heckman, Smith, and Clements
1997 and the nonparametric tests for this assumption in Dong
and Shen 2016). However, if what policy makers care about
is how the outcome distribution changes with the treatment,
then the QTE or similarly the intensive margin effect is the
treatment effect of policy interest. In our empirical application,

A1 and A2 are the standard RD identifying assumptions
(Hahn, Todd, and van der Klaauw 2001). A1 requires a positive fraction of compliers at the RD threshold. A2 is a monotonicity assumption ruling out defiers. A2 can be weakened by
the assumption that conditional on the values of potential outcomes, there are more compliers than defiers (de Chaisemartin
2014).
A3 requires that the conditional joint distribution of potential outcomes and potential sample selection conditional on the
running variable is continuous.5 The observed sample selection
S = S0 + T (S1 − S0 ) is allowed to change at the RD cutoff. In
contrast, in the standard RD design, only the conditional distribution of potential outcomes, FYt∗ |R, (y|r) for  ∈ {A, N, C}, is
required to be continuous (see, e.g., Hahn, Todd, and van der
Klaauw 2001; Dong 2016).
The smoothness conditions in A3 are imposed on the full
sample of observations with or without missing outcomes. The
standard RD argument applies that covariates are not needed
for consistency in estimating unconditional treatment effects,
though they can be useful for improving efficiency or for testing validity of the RD design. A3 is plausible given no precise
manipulation of the running variable and hence no sorting—the
typical argument for the standard RD design identification (Lee
2008).
A3 has readily testable implications. One can follow the standard RD validity tests to test smoothness of the density of the
running variable (McCrary 2008; Cattaneo, Jansson, and Ma
2016) and smoothness of the conditional means of predetermined covariates at the RD cutoff.
Theorem 1. Let g(·) be any measurable real function such that
E|g(·)| < ∞. If Assumption 1 holds, then for t = 0, 1,

the outcome of primary interest is the final GPA in college.
The extensive margin effect measures the impact of academic probation on the probability of completing college,
while the intensive margin effect measures how academic
probation affects the GPA (measuring quality or training) of college graduates, regardless of the composition
change.
Let F·|· (·|·) or F·|· (·) denote the conditional distribution function throughout the article.
Assumption 1. The following assumptions hold jointly with
probability 1 for r ∈ (r0 − ε, r0 + ε).
A1. (Discontinuity): limr↓r0 E[T |R = r] = limr↑r0 E[T |R = r].
A2. (Monotonicity): Pr(D) = 0.
A3. (Smoothness): FYt∗ ,St |R, (y, s|r) for s, t ∈ {0, 1} and  ∈
{A, N, C} are continuous at r0 . Pr(|R = r) for  ∈
{A, N, C} is continuous at r0 . The density of R is continuous and strictly positive at r0 .

Note that g(Y ∗ )S in the above is observed and is equal
to g(Y ) if S = 1, and 0 if S = 0. When g(Y ∗ ) = 1(Y ∗ ≤ y)
for y in R from the distribution of (Y, S, T, R), Equation
(1) identifies FYt∗ |St =1,R=r0 ,C (y) for t = 0, 1, the counterfactual distribution of observed outcomes under treatment
or no treatment. When g(Y ∗ ) = Y ∗ , Equation (1) identifies E[Yt∗ |St = 1, R = r0 , C] and hence the intensive margin
E[Y1∗ |S1 = 1, R = r0 , C] − E[Y0∗ |S0 = 1, R = r0 , C] . In addition, given Equation (2), the extensive margin can be simplified
to the standard fuzzy RD estimand,
E [S1 − S0 |R = r0 , C]
=

limr↓r0 E [S|R = r] − limr↑r0 E [S|R = r]

E[g(Yt∗ )|St = 1, R = r0 , C] = E[g(Yt∗ )|S = 1, R = r0 , C], and
hence Equation (3) would identify E[g(Y1∗ )|S = 1, R = r0 , C]
−E[g(Y0∗ )|S = 1, R = r0 , C]. In particular,

where the first equality follows from Assumption A3, the second quality follows from the fact that T = 1 for C when r >

from continuity of E[g(Y1∗ )|S = 1, R = r, C]. One can similarly
show E[g(Y0∗ )|S0 = 1, R = r0 , C] = E[g(Y0∗ )|S = 1, R = r0 , C],
given continuity of E[g(Y0∗ )|S = 1, R = r, C].6
To estimate the extensive and intensive margin effects, the
standard RD estimation can be applied, since both parameters involve strictly conditional means at a boundary point. Let
g(Y ∗ ) = Y ∗ , local linear or polynomial regressions can be used
to consistently estimate the four discontinuities in Equations (1)
and (2). Bandwidth choices can follow the plug-in approaches
of Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012) or Calonico, Cattaneo and
Titiunik (2014, CCT hereafter).
Alternatively, one can apply the standard fuzzy RD estimator
to estimate the extensive margin effect E[S1 − S0 |R = r0 , C].7
One can also apply the standard fuzzy RD estimator to estimate
E[Yt∗ |St = 1, R = r0 , C] for t = 0, 1 and hence the difference or

The previous section shows identification of the extensive and
intensive margin effects. Sample composition may change with
the treatment status, so those with S1 = 1 are not necessarily the
same individuals as those with S0 = 1. For example, the subpopulation with S1 = 1 would involve new participants if treatment
increases participation, or would not include quitters if treatment reduces participation. This section further discusses identification of subgroup treatment effects.
The analysis extends the discussion in Angrist (2001).
Angrist noted that in the case of nonnegative outcomes with
a nontrivial fraction of zeros (e.g., wages or health care utilization), the conditional-on-positives (COP) effect does not
measure the true causal impact of any treatment on participating
individuals.
Following principle stratification (Frangakis and Rubin
2002), one can classify individuals into four subgroups based
on their joint distribution of potential sample selection status:
new participants (S0 = 0, S1 = 1), quitters (S0 = 1, S1 = 0),
never participants (S0 = S1 = 0) and always participants
(S0 = 1, S1 = 1). Further note that the RD design only identifies treatment effects locally among compliers, so these
four types are defined among compliers. That is, we essentially
define principle strata based on the joint distribution of potential
sample selection and potential treatment.
Nonparametrically, one cannot achieve point identification of the treatment effect for each subgroup of compliers.
However, one may construct sharp bounds on the treatment effect of those always participating compliers, that is,
E[Y1∗ − Y0∗ |S0 = 1, S1 = 1, R = r0 , C]. The treatment effect for
this group measures the true causal effect of the treatment that
is not due to changes in participation (Lee 2009). In the case of
academic probation, this parameter measures the causal effect
of academic probation among a stable group of students who
would stay in college regardless of whether they are on probation or not. We focus on deriving bounds on average treatment
effects. Bounds on the corresponding quantile treatment effects
are provided in Online Supplemental Appendix I.8
Define pt ≡ E[St |R = r0 , C], t = 0, 1, which is identified by Equation (2) of Theorem 1. Further define
p jk ≡ Pr(S0 = j, S1 = k|, R = r0 , C) , j, k = 0, 1. The identified distributions in Theorem 1 can be decomposed as

6 That

is, smoothness conditions need to hold for the selected sample in order
for Equation (3) to identify a causal effect for the selected sample.
7 In practice, the fuzzy RD estimator along with its robust bias-corrected inference can be conveniently implemented using the Stata command rdrobust.ado
(https://sites.google.com/site/rdpackages/rdrobust).

and Rubin (2003) and Imai (2008) discussed similar bounds in the context of randomized experiments with perfect compliance. See also Lee (2009),

The above expressions involve fractions of three types of individuals, p11 , p01 , and p10 . Without further assumptions, these
fractions are not point identified. However, it is easy to show
that assuming p11 > 0,
p11 ∈ P ≡(0, 1] ∩ [p0 + p1 − 1, min {p0 , p1 }] .
General bounds for E[Y1∗ − Y0∗ |S1 = 1, S0 = 1, R = r0 , C] can

smallest (largest) p11 /p1 values of Y1 in the conditional distribution Y1∗ |S1 = 1, R = r0 , C and the largest (smallest) p11 /p0
values of Y0 of in Y0∗ |S0 = 1, R = r0 , C belong to always participants. That is, L ≤ E[Y1∗ − Y0∗ |S1 = 1, S0 = 1, R = r0 , C] ≤ U,

These bounds are typically too wide to be informative
in practice. In the following, we consider two commonly
employed assumptions to tighten the bounds for E[Y1∗ −
Y0∗ |S1 = 1, S0 = 1, R = r0 , C].

In our empirical scenario, this assumption assumes that academic probation induces individuals to quit rather than to participate, which is plausible. Existing studies have shown that
probation increases the probability of dropout (Lindo, Sanders,
and Oreopoulos 2010). Monotonic selection is frequently used
in constructing bounds in similar settings (see, e.g. Zhang and
Rubin 2003; Imai 2008; Lee 2009; Blanco, Flores, and FloresLagunes 2013; Chen and Flores 2014, in the context of randomized experiments). Such a monotonicity assumption is consistent with a latent index sample selection model with an additively separable latent error (Heckman 1979, 1990; Vytlacil
2002). Following similar arguments to those in de Chaisemartin
(2014), one can alternatively assume that conditional on potential outcomes, there are more quitting than newly participating
compliers.
Under Assumption 2, the subpopulation with S1 = 1 consists
of only always participants, that is, those having S0 = 1 and
S1 = 1, while the subpopulation with S0 = 1 consists of always
participants (S0 = 1, S1 = 1) and quitters (S0 = 1, S1 = 0). Let
q = p10 /p0 denote the fraction of quitters among the subpopulation with S0 = 1.

The worst-case (best-case) scenario is that the largest

Y0∗ |S0 = 1, R = r0 , C belong to always participants and the

The quantiles Q0 (τ ) for τ = 1 − q, q can be obtained
from the identified conditional distribution FY0∗ |S0 =1,R=r0 ,C (y)
by Theorem 1, once one knows q. In particular, Q0 (τ ) =
inf{y:FY0∗ |S0 =1,R=r0 ,C (y) ≥ τ }. The following Lemma 1 provides
identification of q.
Lemma 1. 1 If Assumptions 1 and 2 hold, then

3.1 Bounds Under Monotonic Selection
Given pt ≡ E[St |R = r0 , C], t = 0, 1, ruling out one type of
compliers allows one to identify the fractions of the remaining two types. We therefore impose the following monotonicity
assumption.
Assumption 2 (Monotonic Selection): Pr(S0 ≥ S1 ) = 1.
Assumption 2 requires that treatment can only affect sample selection in “one direction,” in particular, everyone is less
likely to participate under treatment. Derivation for S1 ≥ S0 is
symmetric to that for S0 ≥ S1 , so for now we focus on S0 ≥ S1 .

q=

limr↓r0 E [S (1 − T ) |R = r] − limr↑r0 E [S (1 − T ) |R = r]

Further by the inequalities in (6), we obtain the following
bounds.

All the terms are identified by Theorem 1 and Lemma 1.
Conditional means in the first terms of the lower and upper
bounds can be identified by Equation (1) of Theorem 1, setting g(Y ∗ ) = Y ∗ for t = 1, while those in the second terms can
be identified by setting g(Y ∗ ) = 1(Y ∗ ≥ Q0 (q))Y ∗ or g(Y ∗ ) =
1(Y ∗ ≤ Q0 (1 − q))Y ∗ for t = 0.
The above bounds fall in the class of “worst-case” bounds
by Horowitz and Manski (1995) and hence are sharp by
their Proposition 4. That is, Lm (U m ) is the largest (smallest)
lower (upper) bound for E[Y1∗ − Y0∗ |S1 = 1, S0 = 1, R = r0 , C]
that is consistent with the observed data. Neither exclusion restriction nor bounded support of the outcome is
required for these bounds. In contrast, the bounds proposed
by Horowitz and Manski (2000) require that the support
of the outcome is bounded so one can impute the missing data with either the largest or the smallest possible
values.
Theorem 2 provides bounds on the treatment effect for the
always participating compliers. The quitting compliers participate only under no treatment. Without making any assumptions on their counterfactual outcomes under treatment, bounds
can be constructed only for their potential outcome under no
treatment E[Y0∗ |S1 = 0, S0 = 1, R = r0 , C]. The upper bound
is 1q E[1(Y0∗ ≥ Q0 (1 − q))Y0∗ |S0 = 1, R = r0 , C], and the lower
bound is 1q E[1(Y0∗ ≤ Q0 (q))Y0∗ |S0 = 1, R = r0 , C].
In addition, Theorem 2 assumes that S0 ≥ S1 holds almost
surely. If instead S1 ≥ S0 holds almost surely, then Lm ≤
E[Y1∗ − Y0∗ |S1 = 1, S0 = 1, R = r0 , C] ≤ U m , where

Step 2: Estimate q by the standard fuzzy RD estimator, using S
as the outcome and S(1 − T ) as the treatment. Denote
the estimate as q̂.
Step 3: Estimate FY0∗ |S0 =1,R=r0 ,C (y) by the standard fuzzy RD
estimator, using 1(Y ∗ ≤ y)S(1 − T ) as the outcome and
S(1 − T ) as the treatment. Then invert the estimated
distribution to get the quantiles Q̂0 (q̂) and Q̂0 (1 − q̂).9
Step 4: Estimate E[1(Y0∗ ≤ Q0 (1 − q))Y0∗ |S0 = 1, R = r0 , C]
and E[1(Y0∗ ≥ Q0 (q))Y0∗ |S0 = 1, R = r0 , C] by the
standard fuzzy RD estimators, using S(1 − T ) as
the treatment and 1(Y ∗ ≤Q̂0 (1 − q̂))Y ∗ S(1 − T )
and 1(Y ∗ ≥Q̂0 (q̂))Y ∗ S(1 − T ), respectively, as the
outcomes.
Step 5: Construct bounds by replacing each term involved in
Theorem 2 with their estimates from Steps 1 to 4.
By construction, the lower and upper bounds are ordered,
that is, Lm ≤ U m , so confidence intervals for the true parameter
can be constructed following Imbens and Manski (2004),
using bootstrapped standard errors. Such confidence intervals are valid by Lemma 3 of Stoye (2009), and by noticing
that estmators of the proposed bounds are smooth functions of asymptotically normal estimators in Steps 1 to 4
(Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik 2014; Frandsen, Frölich,
and Melly 2012). If desired, one can also construct confidence intervals for the entire identification region, for
example, by bootstrap, following Horowitz and Manski
(2000).
3.2 Subgroup Characteristics and Testable Implications
of Monotonic Selection
Monotonic selection stated in Assumption 2 plays an important role in obtaining the sharp bounds in Theorem 2. By blocking sample selection in one direction, this assumption also
permits point identification of subgroup characteristics among
compliers. Identifying subgroup characteristics provides important information regarding what types of individuals are more
likely to quit (or participate) when they are under treatment. For
example, in our empirical application, it is of policy interest to
determine what types of students would quit when placed on
academic probation.
Identifying subgroup characteristics also leads to the opportunity of verifying the monotonic selection assumption. Under
Assumption 2, the identified probability distribution of characteristics for the quitting compliers should be bounded between
0 and 1. Otherwise, what is identified is a weighted difference in
the probability distribution of characteristics between the quitting compliers and the newly participating compliers, and hence
could lie outside of the interval [0, 1].
Let X with a support X ⊆ R be some predetermined covariate
other than the running variable. Following Theorem 1, immediately we have the following corollary.

The bounds in Theorem 2 can be conveniently estimated by
the following steps.
Step 1: Estimate E[Y1 |S1 = 1, R = r0 , C] by the standard fuzzy
RD estimator, using Y ∗ ST as the outcome and ST as the
treatment.

9 In

practice, these quantiles can be conveniently estimated by using the RD
quantile treatment effect estimator proposed by Frandsen, Frölich, and Melly
(2012), after replacing T with ST and (1 − T ) with S(1 − T ) to deal with sample
selection.

Corollary 1. Assume that A1 and A2 hold. Assume further that A3 holds after replacing Yt∗ with X. Then for
t = 0, 1,
FX|St =1,R=r0 ,C (x) =

limr↓r0 E [1 (X ≤ x) 1 (T = t ) S|R = r] − limr↑r0 E [1 (X ≤ x) 1 (T = t ) S|R = r]
.
limr↓r0 E [1 (T = t ) S|R = r] − limr↑r0 E [1 (T = t ) S|R = r]

Analogous to Equations (4) and (5), the above identified distributions can be decomposed as follows.
Corollary 2. Assume that A1 and A2 hold. Assume further
that A3 holds after replacing Yt∗ with X. Under Assumption 2,
FX|S1 =1,S0 =1,R=r0 ,C (x) = FX|S1 =1,R=r0 ,C (x), and

Equation (11) along with the inequality E[S1 −
S0 |R = r0 , C] < 0 under Assumption 2 can be easily tested
by one-sided t tests. Equation (11) therefore provides a practical way of verifying the plausibility of monotonic selection in
Assumption 2.
Kitigawa (2015) proposed a similar test for the LATE
assumption of Imbens and Angrist (1994). Kitigawa’s (2015)
test uses the fact that given monotonicity along with the other
LATE assumptions, the identified probability density distributions of potential outcomes for compliers should be nonnegative. Here we test covariates. Typically binary covariates, such
as gender, race, or ethnicity indicators are available. The proposed tests can then be implemented by simply testing that the
identified probabilities of these binary covariates for the quitting
compliers are between 0 and 1.
If instead assuming S1 ≥ S0 , one can analygously identify
characteristics of the always participating compliers and newly
participating compliers. That is,

3.3 Bounds Under Stochastic Dominance
When monotonic sample selection is not plausible, it is
necessary to rely on alternative assumptions to construct
bounds. This section provides sharp bounds for E[Y1∗ −
Y0∗ |S1 = 1, S0 = 1, R = r0 , C] under a different assumption than
Assumption 2.

(8)

Assumption 3 requires that the distribution of potential
outcome Y1∗ (Y0∗ ) for those always participating compliers weakly stochastically dominates that of newly participating (quitting) compliers. This assumption is plausible
when those who participate regardless of treatment states
have better outcomes than those who are induced to participate only in one treatment state (Blanco, Flores, and
Flores-Lagunes 2013; Chen and Flores 2014). Only mean
dominance,
E[Y1∗ |S0 = 1, S1 = 1, R = r0 , C] ≥ E[Y1∗ |S0 =
0, S1 = 1, R = r0 , C] and E[Y0∗ |S0 = 1, S1 = 1, R = r0 , C] ≥
E[Y0∗ |S0 = 1, S1 = 0, R = r0 , C], is needed to derive sharp
bounds on the average treatment effect of the always participating compliers. We impose a stronger assumption to also derive
sharp bounds for the corresponding quantile treatment effects
(provided in Online Supplemental Appendix I).
Theorem 3. Assume that p0 + p1 > 1. If Assumptions 1 and
3 hold, then
Ls ≤ E[Y1∗ − Y0∗ |S1 = 1, S0 = 1, R = r0 , C] ≤ U s , where

Finally, note that Assumptions 2 and 3 may be changed
and combined, depending on their plausibility in a particular
empirical application. For example, if both Assumptions 2 and
3 hold in addition to Assumption 1, then the sharp bounds in
Theorem 2 can be tightened. In particular, stochastic dominance
in Assumption 3 implies that E[Y0∗ |S1 = 1, S0 = 1, R = r0 , C] ≥
E[Y0∗ |S0 = 1, R = r0 , C], while E[Y0∗ |S0 = 1, R = r0 , C] ≥

E[1(Y0∗ ≤ Q0 (1 − q))Y0∗ |S0 = 1, R = r0 , C]. The lower

E[1(Y0∗ ≥

E[Y1∗ |S1 = 1, R = r0 , C] − E[Y0∗ |S0 = 1, R = r0, C] . That is, the
extensive margin is the upper bound in this case.

4. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: ACADEMIC
PROBATION AND GENDER DIFFERENCES IN
RESPONSES
This section applies the proposed approach to evaluate the
impacts of academic probation. Nearly all colleges and universities in the U.S. adopt academic probation to motivate students
to stay above a certain performance standard. Surprisingly little empirical evidence exists on how this popular policy affects
students’ outcomes.
Typically students are placed on academic probation if their
GPAs fall below a certain threshold. Students on probation
face the real threat of being suspended if their performance
continues to fall below the required standard. In a seminal
study, Lindo, Sanders, and Oreopoulos (2010) examined the
effects of academic probation using data from a large Canadian
university. Fletcher and Tokmouline (2010) performed similar
analysis using the U.S. data. Both studies adopt the standard
sharp RD design to evaluate the effects of the first-year (or
first-term) probation. They show that placement on academic
probation discourages some students from continuing in school
while motivating others to perform better. That is, academic
probation simultaneously increases the dropout probability yet
improves the performance of those nondropouts.
Here, we investigate the effects of being ever placed on academic probation in college. Correctly evaluating the overall
effects of academic probation requires dealing with attrition that
differs right above and right below the probation threshold. We
also investigate what type of students are induced to drop out
when placed on probation. For example, although academic probation increases college attrition, it might be welfare improving
if those who drop out are low performing students who would
not gain much from staying in college anyways. Identifying the
characteristics of dropouts is possible given our identification
results on subgroup characteristics in Section 3.2.
Let Y ∗ be the cumulative GPA. Let S be a sample selection
indicator which is 1 if a student does not drop out and 0 otherwise. Y ∗ is observed only if S = 1, that is, a student does
not drop out by the time their performance is measured. Our
main analysis focuses on the final GPAs of college graduates.
We additionally look at GPAs at the end of the first, second,
third, and fourth academic years. The treatment T is an indicator of whether a student has ever been on probation. The running variable R is the first semester GPA. Fuzzy RD designs are
entailed, since students with the first semester GPA falling just
above the probation threshold may still fail and be placed on
probation later. One exception occurs when the outcome under
consideration is performance at the end of the first year (second
semester). In this case, probation is determined solely by the first
semester GPA falling below the probation threshold and hence
the RD design is sharp.
The analysis draws on confidential data from a large public university in Texas. These data are collected under the
Texas Higher Education Opportunity Project (THEOP).10 An
undergraduate at this university is considered to be “scholastically deficient” if his or her GPA falls below 2.0. We do not
10 Fletcher and Tokmouline (2010) also used the THEOP data, but all the data
used in this article are obtained and processed independently.

observe the actual probation status. The treatment T is set to be 1
as long as a student’s cumulative GPA is below the school-wide
cutoff 2.0, that is, when a student is considered to be “scholastically deficient.”11 The data represent the entire population of the
first-time freshmen cohorts between 1992 and 2002. Their college transcript information is available from 1992 to 2007. We
include in our sample all students for whom we have complete
records. The total sample size is 64,310.
Table 1 presents the sample summary statistics for the full
sample and the sample with the first semester GPA falling
between 1.5 and 2.5 (referred to as the close-to-cutoff sample).12 The sample size for final GPA is much smaller, indicating
serious sample selection or attrition. Compared with students
who have never been placed on probation, those ever on probation are much less likely to complete college, 44.4% lower
in the full sample or 30.4% lower in the close-to-cutoff sample.
Among students who compete college, those ever on probation
also have lower final GPAs, 0.627 lower for the full sample
and 0.243 lower for the close-to-cutoff sample. However,
these simple correlations do not represent the causal impacts
of academic probation, since students ever on probation are
expected to be poorer performers. For example, they have lower
SAT scores on average. They are also less likely to be ranked
among the top 25% of their high school classes and less likely
to be a member of National Honors Society (NHS). In addition,
students ever on probation are more likely to be male and
less likely to be White. All these differences are statistically
significant at the 1% level. The same general pattern holds true
for the close-to-cutoff sample, even though not surprisingly all
the differences are smaller. Still all but one of the differences,
the NHS membership, are statistically significant at the 1%
level for the close-to-cutoff sample.
Figure 1 plots the probabilities of probation conditional on the
first semester GPA for the full sample, women, and men separately.13 For those whose first semester GPAs fall below the probation threshold, the probability of being on probation is 1 by
construction. This one-sided noncompliance implies no defiers,
and hence Assumption A2 holds by design. The estimated discontinuity in the probation probability at the cutoff is 59.3% for
the full sample, 66.3% for women, and 53.6% for men. These
estimates are statistically significant at the 1% level. Therefore,
Assumption A1 holds.
Now consider Assumption A3. There are no consistent tests
for A3. However, one can test its implications, smoothness of
the conditional means of predetermined covariates and smoothness of the density of the running variable. Figure 2(a) shows the
conditional means of some pre-determined covariates, including
SAT score, indicators for male, White, whether one is ranked
among the top 25% of the high school class, whether one is an
NHS member in high school, and whether one is from a feeder
school. Figure 2(b) presents the density of the first semester
11 In practice, when a student is considered as scholastically deficient, he or she
may only be given an academic warning. However, a quick survey administered
to the relevant academic deans suggests that students are generally placed on
probation in this case.
12 The close-to-cutoff sample is used to produce sample summary statistics and
figures only.
13 All our figures are conveniently generated using the Stata command,
rdplot.ado. Details can be found in Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik, (2015).

GPA.14 No noticeable differences are observed in the average
values of the covariates or in the density of the running variable
at the probation threshold. More formally, we perform falsification tests, that is, test the impacts of academic probation on
these covariates. We also test the discontinuity in the density of
the running variable at the RD cutoff (McCrary 2008; Cattaneo,
Jansson, and Ma 2016). Results from these tests are reported in
Table 2. None of the estimates are statistically significant, supporting the validity of the research design here.
We then estimate the extensive and intensive margin effects
based on Theorem 1. Figure 3 visualizes the probability of completing college (top row) and the final mean GPA (bottom row)
given the first semester GPA. Women whose first semester GPAs
fall just below 2.0 are much less likely to complete college than

Notes: All estimates are conditional on compliers at the first semester GPA equal to 2.0; Estimation of the extensive and intensive margins, and the bounds follows the description in
Sections 2 and 3.1, respectively. The CCT bias-corrected robust inference is used; in Panel III, 1 refers to the bounds under the monotonic sample selection assumption, while 2 refers to
the bounds assuming additionally mean dominance, particularly E(Y0 |S0 = 1, S1 = 0, C, R = r0 ) ≥ E(Y0 |S0 = 1, S1 = 1, C, R = r0 ); bootstrapped standard errors are in the parentheses;

a standard error 0.09) on men’s probability of completing college. The estimated effects at the intensive margin are small
and insignificant for both men and women, so academic probation does not seem to promote the ultimate performance of
college graduates. Note that by the standard RD design, the estimated effects of academic probation on final GPAs are all small
and insignificant, hiding any significant changes at the extensive
margin.
To further investigate gender differences in response to placement on probation, the top rows of Figures 4 and 5 show, respectively, the probabilities for women and men to stay in college till
the end of the first, second, third, and fourth years. The bottom
rows show correspondingly their cumulative GPAs. These figures reveal remarkable gender differences. In Figure 4, women
who fall just below the (first-semester) probation threshold are
increasingly more likely to drop out over academic years. In
contrast, in Figure 5 the dropout probability for men in general
does not differ much on either side of the probation threshold in
all years. At the same time, the observed mean GPAs for men
are always higher to the left of the threshold than those to the
right. This visual evidence suggests that while women are more
likely to drop out once being placed on probation, men seem to
cope with this negative signal by improving their performance
to avoid being suspended.
Tables 4 reports the estimated impacts on college persistence
and the cumulative GPA for women. Consistent with the visual
evidence in Figure 4, estimates in Table 4 show that placement
on probation significantly reduces college persistence among
women. Almost all women finish the first year of college,
regardless of their probation status. The estimated impact
on the probability of completing the first year is −1.1% and
is not statistically significant. However, the probabilities of
completing the second, third, and fourth years are estimated

to decrease significantly by 11.7%, 16.2%, and 16.7%, respectively.
Table 5 reports the estimated impacts for men. Placement on
probation has small and insignificant effects on their probability of staying in college in all years, yet it has positive effects on
their observed college GPAs. The estimates range from 0.084
to 0.107 in the first three years and statistically significant. The
estimated effect is 0.113 (with a standard error 0.072) at the end
of the fourth year. These results suggest that men may temporarily improve their performance once they are on probation. No
significant improvement is found in their final GPAs’ by the time
they complete college. Finally, it is worth noting that for men the
standard RD design yields significant estimates that are largely
similar to those estimated intensive margin effects. This is what
one would expect when there are no significant changes at the
extensive margin, or in the dropout probability for men in this
case.
Do relatively low ability women drop out once they are
placed on probation? This would be plausible if they form
rational expectations and make optimal decisions based on
their potential gains from staying in college. Table 6 reports
the estimated average characteristics of those quitting and
always participating compliers among women. Quitters are
more likely to be White. They have slightly higher SAT scores
on average. Note that SAT score is significantly positively
correlated with college final GPA in our sample. For example, SAT score alone explains over 17% of the total sample variation in college final GPA among women. In addition, quitters are more likely to be ranked among the top
25% of their high school classes. Interestingly, quitters seem
to be less likely from a feeder school, suggesting that they
may have fewer high-school peers with whom they can share
information.

Overall estimates in Table 6 do not suggest that those
quitters have lower ability compared with the always participating compliers. Quitter characteristics are all estimated
to carry the plausible positive sign. It is easy to test
that the estimated probabilities are not negative or greater
than 1, so monotonic selection is plausible. Assume that
those quitters on average would perform at least the same
as the always participants, had they not dropped out,
that is, E[Y0 |S0 = 1, S1 = 0, C, R = r0 ] ≥ E[Y0 |S0 = 1, S1 =
1, C, R = r0 ]. This is a mean dominance in the opposite direction than that implied by Assumption 3. Then analogous to
the discussion at the end of Section 3.3, the upper bound
on the intensive margin effect is E[Y1∗ |S1 = 1, R = r0 , C] −
1
E[1(Y0∗ ≤ Q0 (1 − q))Y0∗ |S0 = 1, R = r0 , C], while the lower
1−q
bound is E[Y1∗ |S1 = 1, R = r0 , C] − E[Y0∗ |S0 = 1, R = r0 , C].
That is, the intensive margin serves as a lower bound for
the true probation effect among those always participating
compliers.
The bottom panels of Tables 3–5 report estimates of the
bounds under monotonic selection and the above bounds under
additionally the mean dominance E[Y0 |S0 = 1, S1 = 0, C, R =
r0 ] ≥ E[Y0 |S0 = 1, S1 = 1, C, R = r0 ]. Imbens and Manski’s
(2004) confidence intervals are reported, since what is of interest
is the confidence interval for the true parameter, not that for the
identification region. Adding the mean dominance assumption
in general tightens the estimated bounds. The estimated intensive margin effects, or the lower bounds on the true probation
effect for those always participating compliers, are small yet
insignificant for women. At the same time, the lower ends of the
90% CIs for women are slightly below zero. That is, although we

can rule out large negative impacts of placement on probation,
there do not seem to be significant gains on average for women.
For men, the probation effects are bounded above zero for the
first three years. The lower end of the 90% confidence interval is
slightly below zero in the fourth year and moves further below
zero by the time they graduate. These results confirm again that
men seem to temporarily improve their GPAs once they are on
probation.
In Online Supplemental Appendix II, we report additional
results for students who are ranked among the top 25% of their
high school classes and those who are not. These additional
results are consistent with a discouragement effect of placement
on academic probation. In particular, those in the top quarter
of their high school classes are more likely to be discouraged
and hence to drop out once on probation. The impacts on the
dropout rates are large (8.7%–11.6%) and statistically significant from the second academic year onward. In contrast, placement on probation has mostly positive yet insignificant impacts
on college persistence among those who are not in the 25% of
their high school classes. In addition, the estimated intensive
margin effects are all positive. We can therefore rule out significant negative impacts of probation on GPAs, even though any
positive effects might be small.
These empirical results reveal striking gender differences
in response to placement on academic probation. College
probation discourages women from completing college. The
discouragement effect is particularly pronounced among those
who perform relatively better in high school. Intuitively, placement on probation is likely to be a greater negative information
shock for them. In contrast, men in general are not discouraged

by this negative signal on performance. Instead men temporarily improve their GPAs to avoid being suspended. These
findings strongly suggest that, to make academic probation
more beneficial, universities and colleges should take into
account the discouragement effects, particularly for women.
It is worth mentioning that our findings of the gender differences differ from those documented by Lindo, Sanders, and
Oreopoulos (2010). In particular, they showed that the dropout
rate among men almost doubles when placed on probation while
that among women has no significant changes. The differential findings could be due to different data (Canadian vs. U.S.
school data) or different policy implementation. For example,
students generally receive a notice about their probation status. Different universities may communicate the message differently. In addition, different universities impose different rules or
restrictions for students who are on probation. They may also
offer different services to assist these students. These variations
may lead to different impacts on students. It is therefore of great
policy interest to perform further analysis using more detailed
data to investigate students’ responses to this negative signal on
performance.

5. CONCLUSION
This article discusses identification of treatment effects
in RD designs when differential sample selection leads to
incomparability of observations near the RD threshold. Sample
selection or missing outcomes can frequently arise due to
dropout, survey nonresponse, censoring, or many other reasons.
We deal with both treatment endogeneity and sample selection issues. Identification in this article does not require any
exclusion restrictions in the selection equation, nor does it
require specifying the selection mechanism. The proposed identification results can therefore be applied broadly. The key identifying assumption, smoothness of the conditional distribution
of potential outcomes and potential sample selection status, is
plausible under no sorting near the RD threshold. This type of
smoothness conditions are typically assumed even in the standard RD design. They also have readily testable implications
and can be easily verified.
This article first provides nonparametric identification of
the extensive and intensive margin effects of the treatment.
This article then constructs sharp bounds on the treatment
effect among a well-defined subgroup of compliers, namely

those always participating compliers. Further discussed is
point identification of each subgroup characteristics among
compliers.
Applying these identification results, we evaluate impacts of
college probation and provide empirical evidence that is different from that by the standard RD design. We show that there
are striking gender differences at the extensive versus the intensive margin in response to placement on probation in college.
The probability for women to complete college decreases significantly if they have ever been placed on academic probation.

Contrary to what one might expect, low ability women are not
more likely to drop out. Instead those who are in the top percentiles of their high school classes are more likely to drop out
once on probation. In contrast, placement on probation has little
impacts on men’s probability of dropping out of college. Men
seem to cope with probation by temporarily improving their
GPAs to avoid being suspended.
For simplicity, this article does not deal with covariates
other than the running variable in developing theory and in
the empirical analysis. The standard argument for RD designs
applies, that is, covariates are not needed for consistency but
may improve efficiency in estimating unconditional treatment
effects. If desired, one can easily incorporate covariates as additional control variables in the local linear or polynomial regressions involved. In addition, this article deals with a single known
cutoff. In some empirical applications, multiple cutoffs exist.
For example, some colleges have floating probation thresholds that depend on the number of credit hours taken. Multiple cutoffs are also common in geographic RD designs (Keele
and Titiunik 2015). This article’s results can be applied by
normalizing all the thresholds to be zero, providing that all the
assumptions hold at each cutoff. Cattaneo et al. (2016) provided
