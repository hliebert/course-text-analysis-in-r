Abstract
The debate between structural and reduced-form approaches has
generated substantial controversy in applied economics. This article reviews a recent literature in public economics that combines
the advantages of reduced-form strategies—transparent and credible identification—with an important advantage of structural
models—the ability to make predictions about counterfactual outcomes and welfare. This literature has developed formulas for the
welfare consequences of various policies that are functions of reduced-form elasticities rather than structural primitives. I present a
general framework that shows how many policy questions can be
answered by estimating a small set of sufficient statistics using
program-evaluation methods. I use this framework to synthesize
the modern literature on taxation, social insurance, and behavioral
welfare economics. Finally, I discuss problems in macroeconomics,
labor, development, and industrial organization that could be tackled using the sufficient statistic approach.

There are two competing paradigms for policy evaluation and welfare analysis in economics: the structural approach and the reduced-form approach (also known as the program-evaluation or treatment-effect approach). The division between structural and
reduced-form methods has split the economics profession into two camps whose research
programs have evolved almost independently despite focusing on similar questions. The
structural approach specifies complete models of economic behavior and estimates or
calibrates the primitives of such models. Armed with the fully estimated model, these
studies then simulate the effects of changes in policies and the economic environment on
behavior and welfare. This powerful methodology has been applied to an array of topics,
ranging from the design of tax and transfer policies in public finance to the sources of
inequality in labor economics and antitrust policy in industrial organization.
Critics of the structural approach argue that it is difficult to identify all primitive parameters in an empirically compelling manner because of selection effects, simultaneity bias, and
omitted variables. These researchers instead advocate reduced-form strategies that estimate
statistical relationships, placing priority on the identification of causal effects using research
designs that exploit quasi-experimental variation.1 Reduced-form studies have identified a
variety of important empirical regularities, especially in labor, public, and development
economics. Advocates of the structural paradigm criticize the reduced-form approach
for estimating statistics that are not policy-invariant parameters of economic models
and therefore have limited relevance for policy and welfare analysis (Rosenzweig &
Wolpin 2000, Heckman & Vytlacil 2005, Deaton 2009).2
This article argues that a set of papers in public economics written over the past decade
(see Table 1) provide a middle ground between the two methods. These papers develop
sufficient-statistic formulas that combine the advantages of reduced-form empirics, transparent and credible identification, with an important advantage of structural models, the
ability to make precise statements about welfare. The central concept of the sufficientstatistic approach (illustrated in Figure 1) is to derive formulas for the welfare consequences of policies that are functions of high-level elasticities rather than deep primitives.
Even though there are multiple combinations of primitives that are consistent with the
inputs to the formulas, all such combinations have the same welfare implications.3 For
example, Feldstein (1999) showed that the marginal welfare gain from raising the incometax rate can be expressed purely as a function of the elasticity of taxable income even
though taxable income may be a complex function of choices such as hours, training, and
effort. Saez (2001) demonstrated that labor-supply elasticity estimates can be used to
make inferences about the optimal progressive income-tax schedule in Mirrlees’s (1971)
model. Chetty (2008) showed that the welfare gains from social insurance can be
expressed purely in terms of the liquidity and moral hazard effects of the program in a
broad class of dynamic, stochastic models. Each of these papers answers a policy question

The term reduced form is a misnomer: The relationships that are estimated are generally not reduced forms of
economic models. I use the term reduced form here simply for consistency with standard terminology used to
describe design-based studies that identify treatment effects.

See section 1 of Rosenzweig & Wolpin (2000) and table V of Heckman & Vytlacil (2005) for a more detailed
comparison of the structural and treatment-effect approaches.

The term sufficient statistic is borrowed from the statistics literature: Conditional on the statistics that appear in
the formula, other statistics that can be calculated from the same sample provide no additional information about
the welfare consequences of the policy.

Notes: Categories used to classify papers are defined as follows: structural, estimate or calibrate primitives to make predictions about welfare;
reduced form, estimate high-level behavioral elasticities qualitatively relevant for policy analysis, but do not provide quantitative welfare results;
sufficient statistic, make predictions about welfare without estimating or specifying primitives. This list includes only selected examples that relate
to the topics discussed in the text and omits many important contributions in each category.

using program-evaluation estimates, providing economic meaning to what might otherwise be viewed as atheoretical statistical estimates.
The goal of this review is to elucidate the key concepts of the sufficient-statistic
methodology and encourage its use as a bridge between structural and reduced-form
methods. I first provide a general framework for the derivation of sufficient-statistic
formulas for welfare analysis. This framework shows how envelope conditions from
optimization can be used to reduce the set of parameters that need to be identified. I then
illustrate the approach by reviewing several recent papers on tax policy, social insurance,
and behavioral public finance.
The idea that it is adequate to estimate certain sufficient statistics rather than the full
primitive structure to answer certain questions is not new; it was well understood by the
pioneers of structural estimation in the Cowles Commission (Marschak 1953, Koopmans
1953). Indeed, Heckman & Vytlacil (2007) labeled this idea “Marschak’s maxim,” arguing
that “for many decisions (policy problems), only combinations of explicit economic parameters are required—no single economic parameter need be identified.” In early microeconometric work, structural methods were preferred because the parameters of the simple

The sufficient-statistic approach. Here we consider a policy instrument t that affects social welfare
W(t).
dW  The structural approach maps the primitives ðoÞ directly to the effects of the policy on welfare
dt . The sufficient-statistic approach leaves o unidentified and instead identifies a smaller set of
high-level parameters ðbÞ using program-evaluation methods, e.g., via a regression of an outcome y on
exogenous variables X. The b vector is sufficient for welfare analysis in that any vector o consistent
with b implies the same value of dW
dt . Identifying b does not identify o because there are multiple o
vectors consistent with a single b vector.

models being studied in principle could be easily identified.4 In the 1980s, it became clear
that identifying primitives was difficult once one permitted dynamics, heterogeneity, and
selection effects. Concerns about the identification of parameters in these richer models
led a large group of empirical researchers to abandon structural methods in favor of
more transparent quasi-experimental research designs (e.g., Lalonde 1986, Card 1990,
Angrist & Krueger 1991).5 A large library of treatment-effect estimates was developed in
the 1980s and 1990s. The recent sufficient-statistic literature maps these treatment-effect
estimates into statements about welfare in structural models that incorporate dynamics,
heterogeneity, and general equilibrium effects.
The structural and sufficient-statistic approaches to welfare analysis should be viewed
as complements rather than substitutes because each approach has certain advantages. The
sufficient-statistic method has three benefits. First, it is simpler to implement empirically
because less data and variation are needed to identify marginal treatment effects (MTEs)
than to fully identify a structural model. Indeed, because of the estimation challenges,
structural primitives are often calibrated to match reduced-form moments rather than
formally estimated using microdata (Dawkins et al. 2001). The sufficient-statistic approach
obviates the need to fully calibrate the structural model. This is especially beneficial in
models with heterogeneity and discrete choice, in which the set of primitives is very large
but the set of MTEs needed for welfare evaluation remains small. By estimating the relevant
MTEs as a function of the policy instrument, one can integrate the formula for the marginal
welfare gain between any two observed values to evaluate policy changes.

4

An exception is the work of Harberger (1964), who advocated the use of elasticities as sufficient statistics for tax
policy analysis in equilibrium models. As I discuss in Section 3, Harberger’s work can be viewed as a predecessor to
the modern sufficient-statistic literature.

Imbens & Wooldridge (2008) reviewed program-evaluation methods, and Imbens (2009) discussed the advantages
of such methods from a statistical perspective.

Second, the identification of structural models often requires strong assumptions given
available data and variation. As it is unnecessary to identify all primitives, sufficientstatistic formulas can be implemented under weaker assumptions using design-based empirical methods. The results are therefore more transparent and empirically credible. Third,
the sufficient-statistic approach can be applied even when one is uncertain about the
positive model that generates observed behavior, such as in recent studies in the behavioral
economics literature that document deviations from perfect rationality. In such cases,
welfare analysis based on a structural model may be impossible, whereas the more agnostic
sufficient-statistic approach permits some progress. For instance, Chetty et al. (2009)
derived formulas for the deadweight cost of taxation in terms of price and tax elasticities
in a model in which agents make arbitrary optimization errors with respect to taxes.
The parsimony of the sufficient-statistic approach naturally comes with costs. First,
and most important, a new sufficient-statistic formula must be derived for each question.
For example, Gruber (1997) calculated the optimal level of unemployment benefits using a
sufficient-statistic formula. If one were interested in calculating the optimal duration of
unemployment benefits, one would have to derive a new formula and estimate a new set of
elasticities. In contrast, if one had estimated the structural primitives of the job-search
model used to derive these formulas, different policy simulations could be conducted with
ease. Moreover, for some questions, it may be difficult to derive a sufficient-statistic
formula, and a structural approach may be the only feasible option.
A second potential weakness of sufficient-statistic formulas is that they are more easily
misapplied than structural methods. This is because one can draw policy conclusions from a
sufficient-statistic formula without assessing the validity of the model upon which it is based.
For example, Gorodnichenko et al. (2009) showed that the assumptions about the costs of
evasion underlying Feldstein’s (1999) formula for the excess burden of income taxation are
inconsistent with the data. In contrast, because structural methods require full estimation of
the model, policy conclusions can be drawn only from models that fit the data.
A common argument in favor of the structural approach is that it has advantages in outof-sample predictions. One can also make out-of-sample predictions using the sufficientstatistic approach by estimating MTEs as a function of the policy instrument and making a
statistical extrapolation. For example, by estimating the elasticity of labor supply with
respect to the tax rate at various tax rates, one can extrapolate to the welfare consequences
of tax regimes that have not yet been observed. In principle, structural methods do not
require such ad hoc extrapolations, as the primitive structure is by definition policy invariant. However, in practice, structural models often rely on extrapolations based on functional form assumptions (such as constant-elasticity utilities). Hence, the real advantage of
structural models in out-of-sample predictions comes from the precision of the extrapolation. Statistical extrapolations may be less reliable than extrapolations guided by an economic model that imposes restrictions on how behavior changes with policies.6
The structural and sufficient-statistic methods can be combined to address the shortcomings of each strategy. For instance, a structural model can be calibrated to match the
sufficient statistics that matter for local welfare analysis to improve its empirical credibility.
Conversely, when making out-of-sample predictions using a sufficient-statistic formula,

See Lumsdaine et al. (1992) and Keane & Wolpin (1997) for comparisons of reduced-form statistical extrapolations and model-based structural extrapolations. These studies found that structural predictions are more accurate,
but statistical extrapolations that include the key variables suggested by the economic model come quite close.

one can use a structural model to guide the choice of functional forms used to extrapolate
the key elasticities. By combining the two methods in this manner, researchers can pick a
point in the interior of the continuum between reduced-form and structural estimation,
without being pinned to one end point or the other. In addition, sufficient-statistic formulas
provide theoretical guidance for reduced-form empirical work by identifying the parameters of greatest interest for a given question.
The review is organized as follows. The next section discusses Harberger’s (1964)
formula for the deadweight cost of taxation, a precursor to the modern literature on
sufficient statistics. In Section 3, I develop a general framework that provides a six-step
rubric for deriving sufficient-statistic formulas. Sections 4 through 6 review applications of
the sufficient-statistic method to income taxation, social insurance, and behavioral (nonrational) models. These three sections provide a synthesis of the modern public-finance
literature, showing how a dozen seemingly unrelated papers are essentially variants on the
theme of finding sufficient statistics. The review concludes in Section 7 with a discussion
of potential applications to fields beyond public finance.

2. A PRECEDENT: MEASURING DEADWEIGHT LOSS
Harberger (1964) popularized the measurement of the excess burden of a commodity tax
using a simple elasticity-based formula. This result can be viewed as a precedent to the
modern literature on sufficient statistics and provides a starting point from which to build
intuition about the applications discussed below.
Let us consider a static general equilibrium model in which an individual is endowed
with Z units of the numeraire (y), whose price is normalized to 1. Firms convert the
numeraire good y (which can be interpreted as labor) into J other consumption goods,
x ¼ ðx1 ; . . . ; xJ Þ. Producing xj units of good j requires an input of cj ðxj Þ units of y, where cj
P
is a weakly convex function. We let cðxÞ ¼ Jj¼1 cj ðxj Þ denote the total cost of producing a
vector x. Production is perfectly competitive. The government levies a unit tax t on good 1.
We let p ¼ ðp1 ; . . . ; pJ Þ be the vector of pretax prices for the produced goods, which are
determined endogenously in market equilibrium.
To simplify the exposition, we ignore income effects by assuming that utility is quasilinear in y. The consumer takes the price vector as given and solves
max uðx1 ; . . . ; xJ Þ þ y
x;y
s:t: px þ tx1 þ y ¼ Z;

ð1Þ

where uðxÞ is strictly quasiconcave. The representative firm takes prices as given and
solves
max p  x  cðxÞ:
x

ð2Þ

These two problems define maps from the price vector p to the demand and supply of the J
goods, xD ðpÞ and xS ðpÞ. The model is closed by the market-clearing condition xD ðpÞ ¼ xS ðpÞ.
We let p(t) denote the market-clearing price vector as a function of the tax rate t.
Let us suppose the policy maker wants to measure the efficiency cost of the tax t. The
efficiency (or deadweight) cost of a tax increase equals the loss in surplus from the transactions that fail to occur because of the tax. In calculating the efficiency cost, the conceptual
experiment is to measure the net loss in welfare from raising the tax rate and returning

the tax revenue to the taxpayer through a lump-sum rebate.7 With quasi-linear utility, the
consumer will always choose to allocate the lump-sum rebate to consumption of the
numeraire good y. Social welfare can therefore be written as the sum of the consumer’s
utility (which is a money metric given quasilinearity), producer profits, and tax revenue:

x

where the second equation effectively recasts the decentralized equilibrium as a planner’s
allocation problem. The term in curly brackets measures private surplus; the tx1 term
measures tax revenue. The individual treats tax revenue as fixed when choosing x, failing
to internalize the effects of his behavior on the lump-sum transfer he ultimately receives.
This assumption, which is standard in efficiency-cost calculations, captures the intuition
that in an economy populated by a large number of individuals, any one individual has a
negligible impact on the government revenue and therefore treats it as fixed.
There are two approaches to estimating the effect of an increase in the tax on social
 
welfare dW
dt . The first is to estimate (or calibrate) a J good demand and supply system to
recover the utility function uðxÞ and cost function cðxÞ. Once u and c are known, one can
directly compute WðtÞ, recognizing that the tax t will affect equilibrium prices and quantities in all J markets. Preferences can be recovered using the parametric demand systems
proposed, for instance, by Stone (1954) or Deaton & Muellbauer (1980). Alternatively,
one can fit a demand system to the data and then integrate to obtain the expenditure
function, as in Hausman (1981) or Hausman & Newey (1995). The econometric challenge in implementing any of these structural methods is simultaneity: Identifying the
slope of the supply and demand curves requires 2J instruments.
Harberger (1964) proposed an alternative, simpler solution to the problem.8 Differentiating Equation 3 and exploiting the first-order conditions from consumer and firm
maximization yield

tax change that lies within the observed support of t by integrating Equation 4:

Formally, excess burden is defined using equivalent or compensating variation measures (e.g., see Auerbach 1985).
The social-welfare calculation here is equivalent to these measures because we are considering a specification
without income effects. With income effects, the Harberger formula discussed below applies with the Hicksian
elasticity in place of the Marshallian elasticity.

individuals and firms (subject to constraints imposed by the government). Although the
tax induces changes in behavior, these behavioral responses cannot have a first-order effect
on private welfare; if they did, consumers
or firms would not be optimizing. Second, the
 
changes in equilibrium prices dp
can also be ignored when calculating dW
dt
dt . This is
because prices cancel out of the expression for social welfare in Equation 3. Changes in
prices simply redistribute income from producers to consumers without changing aggregate surplus.
These two observations imply that the loss in social surplus from the tax is determined
purely by the difference between the agent’s willingness to pay for good x1 and the cost of
producing good x1 . The difference can be measured by the area between the supply and
demand curves and the initial and post-tax quantities (i.e., the Harberger triangle), which
dx1

@x1 @p2
@x1 @pJ

is proportional to dx
dt . The total derivative dt ¼ @p1 @t þ @p2 @t þ . . . þ @pJ @t measures the
effect of an increase in the tax rate on x1 , allowing all prices and equilibrium demands to
1
change endogenously. The simplicity of Harberger’s approach stems from estimating dx
dt
directly rather than estimating its various components, which is effectively what the
structural approach requires.
The tradeoffs between the sufficient-statistic and structural approaches are apparent in
the debate that followed Harberger’s work. One limitation of Equation 4 is that it does not
permit pre-existing distortions in the other markets; otherwise the spillover effects would
have first-order effects on welfare. This limitation can be addressed by an extension of the
formula that includes cross-price elasticities, as shown in Harberger’s original analysis.
Under empirically plausible approximations about the structure of the distortions, the
formula can be expressed purely in terms of own-price elasticities (Goulder & Williams
2003). Hence, a different sufficient-statistic formula is required to handle cases with preexisting distortions.9
A second limitation of Equation 4 is that it cannot be used directly to evaluate counterfactual policy changes, such as the imposition of a large new tax on good x1 . This
1
limitation can be addressed by estimating dx
dt ðtÞ for various values of t and making
functional-form assumptions to extrapolate out of sample. In practice, the Harberger
formula is typically implemented under a linear or log-linear approximation to demand
1
(e.g., dx
dt constant) because data limitations preclude the estimation of higher-order properties of the demand curve. Simulations of calibrated models suggest that implementations
of Harberger’s formula using linear approximations are generally quite accurate (Shoven
1976, Ballard et al. 1985). Thus, despite its limitations, the simple Harberger triangle
formula has become central to applied welfare analysis and has inspired a vast literature
estimating tax elasticities.
The benefits of Harberger’s approach are especially evident in modern structural models that permit heterogeneity across individuals and discrete choice. I now incorporate
these features into the preceding analysis, following Small & Rosen’s (1981) analysis for
the discrete-choice case.

9

A related concern is that one may inadvertently ignore some pre-existing distortions and apply an inaccurate
version of the Harberger formula. Indeed, Goulder & Williams (2003) argued that previous applications of the
simple formula in Equation 4 to assess the deadweight costs of commodity taxation are biased by an order of
magnitude because they fail to account for interactions with the labor-income tax. This mistake would not have
been made in a properly specified structural model.

The structural approach requires identifying the demand functions and utilities for all i
agents. The sufficient-statistic approach simplifies the identification problem substantially
here. Because there is an envelope condition for xi for every agent, we can ignore all

The effect of a tax increase on aggregate demand dx
is a sufficient statistic for the
dt
marginal excess burden of that tax; there is no need to characterize the underlying heterogeneity in the population to implement Equation 7. Intuitively, even though each individual has a different demand elasticity, what matters for government revenue and aggregate
welfare is the total change in behavior induced by the tax.10
1
An important caveat is that with heterogeneity, dx
dt may vary considerably with t because the individuals at the margin will differ with the tax rate. Hence, it is especially
important to distinguish average and marginal treatment effects for welfare analysis by
1
estimating dx
dt ðtÞ as a function of t in this case.
Extension 2: Discrete Choice. Now suppose individuals can only choose one of the
J products f1; . . . ; Jg. These products might represent models of cars, modes of transportation, or neighborhoods. Each product is characterized by a vector of K attributes
xj ¼ ðx1j ; . . . ; xKj Þ observed by the econometrician and an unobservable attribute zj .
If agent i chooses product j, his utility is
uij ¼ vij þ eij
with vij ¼ Zi  pj þ zj þ fi ðxj Þ;
where eij is a random unobserved taste shock. Let Pij denote the probability that individual
P
i chooses option j, Pj ¼ i Pij denote total (expected) demand for product j, and
P ¼ ðP1 ; . . . ; PJ Þ denote the vector of aggregate product demands. Product j is produced
P
by competitive firms using cj ðPj Þ units of the numeraire good y, and cðPÞ ¼ j cj ðPj Þ. This
model differs from the one above in two respects: (a) Utility over the consumption goods is

10
Of course, to analyze a policy that has heterogeneous impacts across groups (such as a progressive income tax),
one needs group-specific elasticity estimates to calculate dW
dt . The key point, however, is that the only heterogeneity
that matters is at the level of the policy impact; any additional heterogeneity within groups can be ignored. For
instance, heterogeneous labor-supply responses within an income group need to not be characterized when analyzing optimal progressive income taxation.

To build intuition, first consider a case in which individuals make binary decisions about

At the microeconomic level, this envelope condition reflects the fact that the marginal

standard multinomial logit discrete choice models, assume that eij has a type 1 extreme

The classical approach to policy analysis in these models is to estimate the distributions of fi
and zj and simulate total surplus before and after a policy change (e.g., see Train 2003, p.
60). Identification of such models is challenging, especially if the econometrician does not
observe all product attributes, as zj will be correlated with pj in equilibrium (Berry 1994,
Berry et al. 1995).
Sufficient-statistic approaches offer a means of policy analysis that does not require
identifying fi and zj . For example, let us suppose the government levies a tax t on good 1,
raising its price to p1 þ t. The government returns the proceeds to agents through a lump-sum
transfer T so that yi becomes yi þ T. As above, agents do not internalize the effects of their
behavior on the size of the transfer T. Using the envelope condition for profit maximization,

The efficiency cost of a tax on all products depends on the aggregate expenditure elasticity
for the taxed market; it does not require estimation of the substitution patterns within that
market. A similar derivation can be used to show that the efficiency cost of a tax on a
single characteristic, such as gas mileage, can be calculated simply by estimating the effect
of the tax on the equilibrium quantity of that characteristic (e.g., gasoline consumption).
Hence, many policy questions of interest can be answered simply by estimating reducedform aggregate demand responses even in discrete-choice models.
The modern sufficient-statistic literature builds on Harberger’s idea of identifying only
the aspects of the model relevant for the question at hand. Before describing specific
applications of this approach, I present a general framework that nests the papers in this
literature and provides a recipe for developing such formulas.

3. GENERAL FRAMEWORK

Annu. Rev. Econ. 2009.1:451-488. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org
by University of St. Gallen on 03/11/13. For personal use only.

Abstractly, many government policies amount to levying a tax t to finance a transfer TðtÞ.
In the context of redistributive taxation, the transfer is to another agent; in the context of
social insurance, it is to another state; and in the context of the excess-burden calculations
above, the transfer can be thought of as being used to finance a public good. I now present
a six-step rubric for calculating the welfare gain from raising the tax rate t [and the
accompanying transfer TðtÞ] using sufficient statistics.
To simplify exposition, I formally present the rubric in a static model with a single
agent. The same sequence of steps can be applied to obtain formulas for multiagent
problems with heterogeneous preferences and discrete choice if UðÞ is viewed as a
(smooth) social-welfare function aggregating the utilities of all the agents, as in Equations
6 and 10. Similarly, dynamics can be incorporated by integrating the utility function over
multiple periods.

3.1. Specify the Structure of the Model
Let x ¼ ðx1 ; . . . ; xJ Þ denote the vector of choices for the representative agent in the private
sector. A unit tax t is levied on choice x1 and the transfer TðtÞ is paid in units of xJ . Let
fG1 ðx; t; TÞ; . . . ; GM ðx; t; TÞg denote the M5J constraints faced by the agent, which include budget constraints, restrictions on insurance or borrowing, hours constraints, and so
on. The agent takes t and T as given and makes her choices by solving
max UðxÞ s:t: G1 ðx; t; TÞ ¼ 0; . . . ; GM ðx; t; TÞ ¼ 0:

ð12Þ

The solution to Equation 12 gives social welfare as a function of the policy instrument:
WðtÞ ¼ max UðxÞ þ
x

M
X

lm Gm ðx; t; TÞ:

m¼1

This specification nests competitive production because any equilibrium allocation can be
viewed as the choice of a benevolent planner seeking to maximize total private surplus
subject to technological constraints.
For example, in the single-agent Harberger model analyzed above,
UðxÞ ¼ uðx1 ; . . . ; xJ1 Þ þ xJ
G1 ðx; t; TÞ ¼ T þ Z  t1 x1  cðx1 ; . . . ; xJ1 Þ  xJ :

ð13Þ

A more general specification of preferences and constraints will yield a formula that is
more robust but harder to implement empirically.

3.2. Express dW

constraint, and @G
@T and @t can be calculated mechanically. For example, in the Harberger

dG1
model, TðtÞ ¼ tx1 and hence dT
dt ¼ x1 þ t dt . Differentiating Equation 13 yields dT ¼ 1 and
dG1
dt

dx1
¼ x1 . It follows that dW
dt ¼ l1 t dt .
The critical unknowns are the lm multipliers. In the excess-burden application, l1
measures the marginal value of relaxing the budget constraint. In a social-insurance
application, l1 could represent the marginal value of relaxing the constraint that limits
the extent to which agents can transfer consumption across states. If l1 is small, there is
little value to social insurance, whereas if it is large, dW
dt could be large.

3.3. Substitute Multipliers by Marginal Utilities
The lm multipliers are recovered by exploiting restrictions from the agent’s first-orderconditions. Optimization leads agents to equate marginal utilities with linear combinations of the multipliers:
u0 ðxj Þ ¼ 

M
X
m¼1

lm

@xj

Inverting this system of equations generates a map from the multipliers into the marginal
utilities. It is helpful to impose the following assumption on the structure of the constraints
in order to simplify this mapping.
Assumption 1: The tax t enters all the constraints in the same way as the good
on which it is levied ðx1 Þ, and the transfer T enters all the constraints in the
same way as the good in which it is paid ðxJ Þ. Formally, there exist functions
kt ðx; t; TÞ, kT ðx; t; TÞ such that

8m ¼ 1; . . . ; M
@T
@xJ

:

Assumption 1 requires that x1 and t enter every constraint interchangeably (up to a scale
factor kt Þ.12 That is, increasing t by $1 and reducing x1 by $kt would leave all constraints
unaffected. A similar interchangeability condition is required for xJ and T. In models with
only one constraint per agent, Assumption 1 is satisfied by definition. In the Harberger
model (in which the only constraint is the budget constraint), kt corresponds to the mechanical increase in expenditure caused by a $1 increase in t ð$x1 Þ versus a $1 increase in
1
in that model. Because increasing the transfer by $1 affects
x1 ð$p1 þ tÞ. Hence, kt ¼ p1xþt
the budget constraint in the same way as reducing consumption of xJ by $1, kT ¼ 1.
Models in which the private-sector choices are second-best efficient subject to the
resource constraints in the economy typically satisfy the conditions in Assumption 1. This
is because the fungibility of resources ensures that the taxed good and tax rate enter all
constraints in the same way (see Chetty 2006a for details). The sufficient-statistic approach can be implemented in models that violate Assumption 1 (see Section 5 for an

This expression captures a simple and general intuition: Increasing the tax t is equivalent
to reducing consumption of x1 by kt units, which reduces the agent’s utility by kt u 0 ðx1 ðtÞÞ.
The additional transfer that the agent gets from the tax increase is dT

Because

specification of the model, this expression distills local welfare analysis to recovering a
pair of marginal utilities.13
In models with heterogeneity, the aggregate welfare gain is a function of a pair of average
marginal utilities across agents. In dynamic models, the welfare gain is also a function of a
pair of average marginal utilities, but with the mean taken over the lifecycle for a given agent.
This result is obtained using envelope conditions when differentiating the value function.

3.4. Recover Marginal Utilities from Observed Choices
The final step in obtaining an empirically implementable expression for dW
dt is to back out
the two marginal utilities. One way to do this is to make assumptions about the relevant
marginal utilities based on surveys or external evidence, such as measures of the value of
an additional year of healthy life. This is implicitly the approach taken in the cost-benefit
analyses sometimes reported in reduced-form studies (e.g., Levitt 1997).
Sufficient-statistic studies recover the marginal utilities from choice data using the
structure of the model specified in step 1. There is no canned procedure for this step. The
applications below provide several illustrations. The trick that is typically exploited is that
the marginal utilities are elements in first-order conditions for various choices. As a result,
they can be backed out from the comparative statics of behavior. For instance, in the singleagent Harberger model above, the assumption of no income effects implies u0 ðxJ Þ ¼ 1. To
identify u0 ðx1 Þ, exploit the first-order condition for x1, which is u0 ðx1 Þ ¼ p1 þ t. Plugging in
these expressions and the other parameters above into Equation 15, we obtain Equation 4:

Let us suppose the sufficient-statistic formula one derives has the following form:

When implementing this expression empirically, researchers should keep two issues in mind.
First, the relevant derivatives may require holding different variables fixed depending upon
13

In many applications, steps 2 and 3 are consolidated into a single step because the constraints can be substituted
directly into the objective function.

the application. For example, the Harberger formula in Equation 4 calls for the measure1
ment of the total derivative dx
dt , which incorporates general equilibrium effects and price
changes in all markets. In contrast, many reduced-form empirical studies explicitly seek to
1
identify the partial derivative @x
@t , holding prices in other markets constant. These studies
typically compare the behavior of a small group of individuals treated by a tax change with
other unaffected individuals. Such studies do not recover the sufficient statistic of interest for
the Harberger policy question. The elasticities they estimate, however, are directly relevant
for assessing the efficiency cost of a tax increase on a small subset of consumers that does not
affect equilibrium prices in other markets. The general lesson is that the experiment used to
identify the relevant elasticities must be matched to the policy question being asked.14 In
situations in which one cannot credibly identify the elasticity called for by the formula, it
may be possible to make progress using approximations (e.g., a tax levied on a small
market has negligible effects on prices in other markets in equilibrium).
The second issue arises from the fact that policy changes of interest are never infinitesimal. The ideal way to implement Equation 16 to assess the efficiency costs of a discrete
policy change is to estimate the inputs as nonparametric functions of the policy instrument
@x1
1
t. With estimates of @x
@t ðtÞ and @Z ðtÞ, one can integrate Equation 16 between any two tax
rates t1 and t2 that lie within the support of observed policies to evaluate the welfare gain
DW for a policy change of interest. This procedure is similar in spirit to Heckman &
Vytlacil’s (2001, 2005) recommendation that researchers estimate a complete schedule of
MTEs and then integrate that distribution over the desired range to obtain policy-relevant
treatment effects. In the present case, the marginal welfare gain at t depends on the MTE
at t; the analysis of nonmarginal changes requires estimation of the MTE as a function
of t. Predictions about welfare gains from policies outside the observed support can be
1
made by extrapolating @x
@t ðtÞ out of sample. That is, one can effectively obtain sufficient
statistics for out-of-sample welfare analysis under assumptions about the functional form
1
of @x
@t ðtÞ.
In most applications, there is insufficient power to estimate x1 ðtÞ nonparametrically.
Instead, typical reduced-form studies estimate local average treatment effects (Angrist et al.
2000), such as the effect of a discrete change in the tax rate from t1 to t2 on demand:
x1 ðt2 Þx1 ðt1 Þ
Dx1
1
. The estimate of Dx
t2 t1
Dt ¼
Dt permits inference about the effect of raising the tax
rate from t1 to t2 on welfare. To see this, consider the Harberger model, in which
dx1
Dx1
dW
dt ðtÞ ¼ t dt ðtÞ. A researcher who has estimated Dt has two options. This first is to bound
the average welfare gain over the observed range:
Wðt2 Þ  Wðt1 Þ ¼

ð t2

Dx1
ðtÞdt ) t1
> dW=dt > t2
:

ð17Þ

Intuitively, the excess burden of taxation depends on the slope of the x1 ðtÞ between t1 and
t2 , multiplied by the height of the Harberger trapezoid at each point. When one observes
only the average slope between the two tax rates, bounds on excess burden can be
obtained by setting the height to the lowest and highest points over the interval.

14
A related problem is that reduced-form studies often estimate the combined effect of multidimensional changes,
such as welfare reforms that affect both time limits and financial incentives to work. Such estimates cannot be
plugged directly into sufficient-statistic formulas. In such cases, structure may be needed to obtain elasticities with
respect to each dimension of the change.

The second option is to use an approximation to x1 ðtÞ to calculate dW=dt. For
instance, if one can estimate only the first-order properties of x1 ðtÞ, making the approxi1
mation that dx
dt is constant over the observed range implies
t1 þ t2 Dx1
:
2
Dt
1
If x1 ðtÞ is linear, the average height of the trapezoid and Dx
Dt exactly determine excess
burden. If one has adequate data and variation to estimate the higher-order terms of
x1 ðtÞ, these estimates can be used to fit a higher-order approximation to x1 ðtÞ to obtain a

more accurate estimate of dW=dt.
The same two options are available in models in which dW
dt is a function of more than one

effects can be mapped directly into the marginal welfare gain: dWðtÞ
dt ¼ f ð Dt ; DZ ; tÞ. If dt
can only be estimated accurately at the current level of t, one can at least determine the
direction in which the policy instrument should be shifted to improve welfare.
The bottom line is that the precision of a sufficient-statistic formula is determined by
the precision of the information available about the sufficient statistics as a function of the
policy instrument. In the applications discussed below, the data and variation available
only permit estimation of first-order properties of the inputs, and the authors are therefore
constrained to calculating a first-order approximation of dW=dt. The potential error in
this linear approximation can be assessed using the bounds proposed above or using a
structural model.

3.6. Model Evaluation
Although sufficient-statistic formulas do not require full specification of the model, they
do require some modeling assumptions; it is impossible to make theory-free statements
about welfare. It is important to assess the validity of these assumptions to ensure that the
formula’s results are accurate. Unfortunately, because this step is not necessary to calculate
dWðtÞ
dt , it is often not implemented in existing sufficient-statistic studies.
The model can be evaluated in two ways. First, one can test qualitative predictions that
would falsify the assumptions that are central for deriving the sufficient-statistic formula.
For example, Harberger’s formula assumes that individuals treat prices and taxes identically, making choices based only on the total price of the good ðp þ tÞ. This assumption
can be tested by comparing price and tax elasticities of demand (Chetty et al. 2009).
Second, one should identify at least one vector of structural parameters o that is consistent
with the sufficient statistics estimated in step 5. If the empirical estimates of the sufficient
statistics are internally consistent with the model, at least one o must fit the estimated
statistics. This is not a stringent test, because the idea of the sufficient-statistic approach is
that there will be multiple values of o consistent with the sufficient statistics. However,
there are cases in which the estimated high-level elasticities may not be consistent with
any underlying vector of primitives, rejecting the assumptions of the model (see Chetty
2006a,b for an example).
The next three sections show how a variety of recent papers in public economics can be
interpreted as applications of this six-step rubric. Each application illustrates different
466

strengths and weaknesses of the sufficient-statistic approach and demonstrates the techniques that are helpful in deriving such formulas.

4. APPLICATION 1: INCOME TAXATION
Since the seminal work of Mirrlees (1971) and others, there has been a large structural
literature investigating the optimal design of income-tax and transfer systems. Several
studies have simulated optimal tax rates in calibrated versions of the Mirrlees model (see
Tuomala 1990 for a survey). A related literature uses microsimulation methods to calculate the effects of changes in transfer policies on behavior and welfare. The most recent
structural work in this area has generalized the Mirrlees model to dynamic settings and
simulated the optimal design of tax policies in such environments using calibrated models.
Parallel to this literature, a large body of work in labor economics has investigated the
effects of tax and transfer programs on behavior using program-evaluation methods (see
Table 1 for examples of structural and reduced-form studies).
Recent work in public economics has shown that the elasticities estimated by labor
economists can be mapped into statements about optimal tax policy in the models that
have been analyzed using structural methods. This sufficient-statistic method has been
widely applied in the context of income taxation in the past decade, with contributions
by Feldstein (1995, 1999), Piketty (1997), Diamond (1998), Saez (2001), Gruber & Saez
(2002), Goulder & Williams (2003), Chetty (2009), and others. All these papers can be
embedded in the general framework proposed above. I focus on two papers here in the
interest of space: Feldstein (1999) and Saez (2001).

4.1. Feldstein (1999)
Traditional empirical work on labor supply did not incorporate the potential effects of
taxes on choices other than hours of work. For instance, income taxes could affect an
individual’s choice of training, effort, or occupational choice. Moreover, individuals may
be induced to shelter income from taxation by evading or avoiding tax payments (e.g.,
taking fringe benefits, underreporting earnings). Although some studies have attempted to
directly examine the effects of taxes on each of these margins, it is difficult to account for
all potential behavioral responses to taxation by measuring each channel separately.
Feldstein proposed an elegant solution to the problem of calculating the efficiency costs
of taxation in a model with multidimensional labor-supply choices. His insight is that the
elasticity of taxable income with respect to the tax rate is a sufficient statistic for calculating deadweight loss. Feldstein considered a model in which an individual makes J laborsupply choices ðx1 ; . . . ; xJ Þ that generate earnings. Let wj denote the wage paid for choice j
and cj ðxj Þ denote the disutility of labor supply through margin xj .15 In addition, let us
suppose that the agent can shelter e of earnings from the tax authority (via sheltering
P
or evasion) by paying a cost gðeÞ. Total taxable income is TI ¼ Jj¼1 wj xj  e. Let
15
Feldstein takes the wage rates wj as fixed, implicitly assuming that the demand for each type of labor supply is
perfectly elastic. Allowing for downward-sloping labor demand curves in a competitive market does not affect the
formula he derives for the same reason that endogenous prices do not affect the Harberger formula in Equation 7.
With endogenous wages, the sufficient statistic for deadweight loss is the total derivative dTI
dt , which incorporates all
equilibrium wage responses to the tax change.

c ¼ ð1  tÞTI þ e denote consumption. For simplicity, assume that utility is linear in c to
abstract from income effects. Feldstein demonstrated that it is straightforward to allow for
income effects. As in the Harberger model, we calculate the excess burden of the tax by
assuming that the government returns the tax revenue to the agent as a lump-sum transfer

Equation 21 shows that we simply need to measure how taxable income responds to
changes in the tax rate to calculate the deadweight cost of income taxation. There is no
need to determine whether TI changes because of hours responses, changes in occupation,
or avoidance behaviors to calculate efficiency costs. Intuitively, the agent supplies labor on
every margin ðx1 ; . . . ; xJ Þ up to the point at which his marginal disutility of earning
another dollar through that margin equals 1  t. The marginal social value of earning an

extra dollar net of the disutility of labor is therefore t for all margins. Likewise, the agent
optimally sets the marginal cost of reporting 1 less to the tax authority [g0 ðeÞ] equal to the
marginal private value of doing so (t). Hence, the marginal social costs of reducing
earnings (via any margin) and reporting less income via avoidance are the same at the
individual’s optimal allocation. This makes it irrelevant which mechanism underlies the
change in TI for efficiency purposes.
The main advantage of identifying dTIðtÞ
dt as a sufficient statistic is that it permits inference
about efficiency costs without requiring the identification of the potentially complex effects
of taxes on numerous labor supply, evasion, and avoidance behaviors. Moreover, data on
taxable income are available on tax records, facilitating the estimation of the key parameter dTI
dt . Feldstein (1995) implemented Equation 21 by estimating the changes in reported
taxable income around the Tax Reform Act of 1986, implicitly using the linear approximation described in step 5 of the rubric. He concluded based on these estimates that the excess
burden of taxing high-income individuals is very large, possibly as large as $2 per $1 of
revenue raised. This result has been influential in policy discussions by suggesting that top
income-tax rates should be lowered (e.g., see Joint Econ. Comm. 2001). Subsequent empirical work motivated by Feldstein’s result has found smaller values of dTI
dt , and the academic
debate about the value of the taxable income elasticity remains active.
The sixth step of the rubric, model evaluation, has only been partially implemented in
the context of Feldstein’s formula. Slemrod (1995) and several other authors have found
that the large estimates of dTI
dt are driven primarily by evasion and avoidance behaviors
de
.
However,
these
structural
parameters [gðeÞ; cj ðxj Þ] of the model have not been evaldt
uated directly. Chetty (2009) gave an example of the danger in not investigating the
structural parameters. He argued that the marginal social cost of tax avoidance may not
be equal to the tax rate at the optimum, violating the first-order condition (Equation 20)
that is critical to derive Equation 21, for two reasons. First, some of the costs of evasion
and avoidance constitute transfers, such as the payment of fines for tax evasion, rather
than resource costs. Second, there is considerable evidence that individuals overestimate
the true penalties for evasion. Using a sufficient-statistic approach analogous to that
above, Chetty relaxed the g0 ðeÞ ¼ t restriction and obtained the following generalization
of Feldstein’s formula:

does not have a large resource cost, changes in e have little efficiency cost, and thus it is
only dLI

Not surprisingly, implementing Chetty’s more general formula requires the identification of more parameters than Feldstein’s formula. The most difficult parameter to identify
is g0 ðeÞ, which is a marginal utility. By leaving g0 ðeÞ in the formula, Chetty does not

be evident in consumption data; thus, the gap between income and consumption measures
can be used to infer g0 ðeÞ. Implementing this method to analyze the efficiency costs of a
large reduction in income-tax rates in Russia, these authors found that g0 ðeÞ is quite small
dLI
and that dTI
dt is substantial, whereas dt is not. They showed that Feldstein’s formula
substantially overestimates the efficiency costs of taxation relative to Chetty’s more general measure. Intuitively, reported taxable incomes are highly sensitive to tax rates, but the
sensitivity is driven by avoidance behavior that has little social cost at the margin and
hence does not reduce the total size of the pie significantly.
This literature underscores the point that sufficient-statistic approaches are not model
free. It is critical to evaluate the structure of the model, even though the formula for dW
dt
can be implemented without the last step of the rubric. In the taxable-income application,
estimating g0 ðeÞ has value instead of simply assuming that g0 ðeÞ ¼ t, given plausible concerns that this condition does not hold in practice.

4.2. Saez (2001)
Harberger and Feldstein studied the efficiency effects and optimal design of a linear tax.
Much of the literature on optimal income taxation has focused on nonlinear income-tax
models and the optimal progressivity of such systems. Mirrlees (1971) formalized this
question as a mechanism design problem and provided a solution in differential equations
that are functions of primitive parameters. The Mirrlees solution offers little intuition into
the forces that determine optimal tax rates. Building on the work of Diamond (1998), Saez
(2001) expressed the optimality conditions in the Mirrlees model in terms of empirically
estimable sufficient statistics.
Saez analyzed a model in which individuals choose hours of work, l, and have heterogeneous wage rates w distributed according to a distribution FðwÞ. Wage rates (skills) are
unobservable to the government. Let pretax earnings be denoted by z ¼ wl. For simplicity,
I again restrict attention to the case without income effects, as in Diamond (1998).
Saez began by analyzing the optimal tax rate on top incomes. He considered a model in
which the government levies a linear tax t on earnings above a threshold z and characterizes the properties of the optimal tax rate t as z ! 1. For a given z, individuals
maximize utility

The social planner’s objective is to maximize a weighted average of individual’s utili~
ties, where the weights GðuÞ
are social-welfare weights that reflect the redistributive
preferences of the planner:


g measures the social value of giving $1 more income to individuals in the top bracket
relative to the value of public expenditure. If g ¼ 1, the government weighs the consumption of the individuals it taxes and public expenditure equally, and Equation 23 collapses
to the Harberger formula for excess burden in Equation 4. When 
g51, the first term in
Equation 23 captures the welfare loss to individuals in the top tax bracket from having to
pay more taxes. The second term reflects the gain in revenue to the government, which
consists of two familiar components: the mechanical gain in revenue and the offset due to
the behavioral response.
Equation 23 illustrates that three parameters are together sufficient statistics for the
welfare
  gain of increasing top income-tax rates: (a) the effect of tax rates on earnings
dzm
dt , which quantifies the distortions created by the tax; (b) the shape of the earnings
distribution [zm ðzÞ], which measures the mass of individuals whose behavior is distorted
by the marginal tax, and (c) the marginal social-welfare weight ð
gÞ, which measures the
planner’s redistributive preferences. We note that Saez does not implement step 4 of the
rubric (recovery of marginal utilities from observed behavior) because he views the relevant marginal utility in this case ðgÞ as a feature of the planner’s social-welfare function
that is external to the choice environment. Thus, g is determined by the shape of the
earnings distribution and the (exogenous) specification of the social-welfare function
(e.g., utilitarian or Rawlsian).
The advantage of Equation 23 relative to a structural approach is that one does not
need to identify preferences ðcÞ or the shape of the skill distribution FðwÞ to calculate
dW=dt. Moreover, one can permit arbitrary heterogeneity across skill types in preferences
without changing the formula. The disadvantage of Equation 23 is that zm ; 
g; and dzdtm are
endogenous to t: The level of earnings and the weight the social planner places on top
earners presumably decrease with t, whereas dzdtm may vary with t depending upon the
shape of the cðlÞ function. Hence, dW
dt ðtÞ measures only the marginal welfare gain at a
given tax rate t and must be estimated at all values of t to calculate the tax rate t that
maximizes W. To simplify empirical implementation and derive an explicit formula for the
optimal tax rate, Saez observed that the ratio zmzðzÞ is approximately constant in the upper

lees model, a and e converge to constants (invariant to t) in the limit as z ! 1. Equation
24 is therefore an explicit formula for the optimal asymptotic top income-tax rate if the
social-welfare weight g is taken as exogenous. For example, one plausible assumption is
that g ! 0 as z ! 1: Saez exploited this property of Equation 24 to calculate optimal top
income-tax rates using reduced-form estimates of the taxable income elasticity for high
incomes (Gruber & Saez 2002) and a Pareto parameter of a ¼ 2 consistent with the
earnings distribution in the United States. He found that optimal top income-tax rates are
generally above 50% when the formula is calibrated using plausible elasticities.
Building on this sufficient-statistic approach, Saez characterized the optimal tax rate at
any income level z in a nonlinear tax system. Let E denote the fixed amount of government
expenditure that must be financed through taxation, and TðzÞ denote the total tax paid by
dz 1t

itself, and hence Equation 25 is not an explicit formula for optimal taxation. The techniques used to obtain the explicit formula for the asymptotic top income-tax rate in Equation 24 cannot be applied at an arbitrary income level z because there are no analogous
limit convergence results. Hence, Equation 25 can only be used to evaluate how perturbing the existing tax system TðzÞ would affect welfare.
To go further and calculate the optimal tax schedule, Saez made additional assumptions about the model’s structure. He assumed that the elasticity eðzÞ is constant, which
pins down the functional form of the utility uðc; lÞ. Given this utility function and an
elasticity estimate taken from the literature, he inferred the skill distribution FðwÞ from
the empirically observed distribution of incomes in the current tax regime. Having identified all the primitives of the model, he simulated the optimal tax schedule in the calibrated
model. The resulting optimal income-tax schedule is inverse-U shaped, with a large lumpsum grant to nonworkers and marginal rates ranging from 50% to 80%.
This exercise illustrates the costs and benefits of placing more structure on the problem.
By assuming a one-parameter constant-elasticity utility, one can point identify the primitives from the data and calculate the optimal tax schedule. However, the strong assumptions required for structural identification of the model reduce our confidence in the
optimal tax-schedule calculations. We have greater confidence in the top tax-rate calculations based on the sufficient-statistic formula in Equation 24 or marginal welfare-gain
calculations based on Equation 25.

5. APPLICATION 2: SOCIAL INSURANCE
Programs such as unemployment insurance (UI), health insurance, social security, workers
compensation, and disability insurance account for the majority of government expenditure in many countries. Starting with seminal contribution of Wolpin (1987), a large
literature has studied the optimal design of social-insurance programs in dynamic structural models. Parallel to this literature, a large body of reduced-form empirical work has
investigated the impacts of social-insurance programs on health expenditures, unemployment durations, consumption, disability claims, and so on (see Table 1 for examples of
structural and reduced-form studies).
In the context of social insurance, an important harbinger to the sufficient-statistic
approach is the work of Baily (1978), who showed that the optimal level of unemployment benefits can be expressed as a function of a small set of parameters in a static model.
Baily’s result was viewed as having limited practical relevance because of the strong
assumptions made in deriving the formula. However, recent work has shown that the
parameters Baily identified are actually sufficient statistics for the welfare analysis of
social insurance in a rich class of dynamic models. Studies in this literature include Gruber
(1997), Chetty (2006a), Shimer & Werning (2007), Chetty (2008), Einav et al. (2008a),
and Chetty & Saez (2008). I now embed these papers in the general framework above,
focusing primarily on the first four papers.16

16
The tax and social-insurance problems are closely related because social insurance is effectively state-contingent
taxation. Rather than levying taxes on the basis of income, taxes and transfers are levied on the basis of a state (e.g.,
joblessness, sickness, injury, and disability). Conversely, redistributive taxation is social insurance against uncertain
skill realizations behind the veil of ignorance.

For simplicity, consider a static model with two states: high and low. Let wh denote the
individual’s income in the high state, and wl 5wh is income in the low state. Let A denote
wealth, ch consumption in the high state, and cl consumption in the low state. The low
state can be thought of as corresponding to job loss, injury, disability, natural disaster, and
so on. The agent can control the probability of being in the bad state by exerting effort e at
a cost cðeÞ. For instance, effort could reflect searching for a job, taking precautions to
avoid injury, or locating a house away from areas prone to natural disasters. Choose units
of e so that the probability of being in the high state is given by pðeÞ ¼ e.
Individuals may have some ability to insure against shocks through informal privatesector arrangements, such as transfers between relatives. To model such informal privateinsurance arrangements, we suppose that the agent can transfer $bp between states at a
cost qðbp Þ, so that increasing consumption by bp in the low state requires payment of a
premium 1e
e bp þ qðbp Þ in the high state. The loading factor qðbp Þ can be interpreted as
the degree of incompleteness in private insurance. If qðbp Þ ¼ 0, private-insurance markets
are complete; if qðbp Þ ¼ 1, there is no capacity for private insurance.
The government pays a benefit b in the low state that is financed by an actuarially fair
tax tðbÞ ¼ 1e
e b in the high state. The model can be formally specified using the notation in
Section 3 as follows:17

In tax models with quasilinear utility, the welfare gain measure dW

need a method of converting dW

This expression, which is Baily’s (1978) formula, corresponds to the marginal utility
expression obtained after the third step of the rubric in Section 3. The first term in
Equation 27 measures the gap in marginal utilities between the high and low states, which
quantifies the welfare gain from transferring an additional dollar from the high to low
state. The second term measures the cost of transferring this additional dollar due to
behavioral responses.
Chetty (2006a) established that the parameters in Equation 27 are sufficient statistics in
that they are adequate to calculate MW ðbÞ in a general class of dynamic models that nest
existing structural models of insurance. He analyzed a dynamic model in which transitions
from the good state to the bad state follow an arbitrary stochastic process. Agents make J
choices and are subject to M constraints. The choices could include variables such as
reservation wages, savings behavior, labor supply, or human capital investments. Subject
to a regularity condition analogous to Assumption 1, Chetty showed that Equation 27
holds in this general model, with the difference in marginal utilities replaced by the
difference between the average marginal utilities in the high and low states over the agent’s
life. This result distills the calculation of welfare gains in complex dynamic models to
two parameters: the gap in average marginal utilities and the elasticity that enters the
government’s budget constraint e1e;b . The identification of parameters such as asset limits
or the degree of private insurance [qðbp Þ] is not required. This permits calculation
of dW
db without the assumptions made in the structural studies for tractability, such as
no private insurance or no borrowing (Hansen & İmrohoroğlu 1992, Hopenhayn &
Nicolini 1997).
Equation 27 cannot be directly implemented because the gap in marginal utilities
remains to be recovered from choice data (step 4 of the rubric). The recent literature has
proposed the use of three types of choice data to recover the marginal utility gap: consumption (Gruber 1997), liquidity and substitution effects in effort (Chetty 2008), and
reservation wages (Shimer & Werning 2007).

Building on work by Hamermesh (1982), Gruber estimated the consumption-smoothing
effect of UI benefits by exploiting changes in UI benefit laws across states in the United
States coupled with panel data on consumption. He estimated a ¼ 0:24 and b ¼ 0:28,
and then calibrated the welfare gain from raising UI benefits using estimates of e1e;b from
Meyer (1990). He found that at conventional levels of risk aversion ðg52Þ, increasing the
UI benefit level above the levels observed in his data (roughly 50% of the wage) would
lead to substantial welfare losses.


Gruber proceeded to solve for the b such that dW
db ðb Þ ¼ 0 in Equation 29 and found

that b is close to zero. These calculations of the optimal benefit level assume that Dc
c is
linear in b, and gðbÞ and e1e;b ðbÞ do not vary with b. This application of the sufficientstatistic formula, which is not guided by a structural model, could be inaccurate because it
uses ad hoc assumptions to make predictions about counterfactuals that are well out of
sample. Equation 29 should not be used to make statements about global optima unless
one can estimate the sufficient statistics for a range of different benefit levels. Lacking such

estimates, a more coherent method of inferring b would be to calibrate a structural model

to match the sufficient statistics and simulate the optimal b in that model, as in Saez
(2001).
A difficulty with Equation 29 is that risk aversion ðgÞ is known to vary substantially
across contexts (Rabin 2000, Chetty & Szeidl 2007). Because Gruber’s results are highly
sensitive to the assumed value of g, more recent studies have sought alternative techniques
for recovering the gap in marginal utilities that do not require an estimate of g.

5.3. Chetty (2008)
Chetty (2008) demonstrated that the gap in marginal utilities in Equation 27 can be
backed out from the comparative statics of effort choice. To see this, we observe that the
first-order condition for effort is

The intuition for this formula is that the gap between marginal utilities in the good and
bad states can be inferred from the extent to which effort is affected by liquidity versus
moral hazard. In a model with perfect consumption smoothing ðch ¼ cl Þ, the liquidity
effect @e=@A ¼ 0 because a cash grant raises uðch Þ and uðcl Þ by the same amount. Chetty
showed that similar to Baily’s formula, Equation 33 holds in a general dynamic search
model because of envelope conditions in the agent’s value functions.
@e
An issue that arises in the empirical implementation of Equation 33 is that @b
must be
measured holding the tax t fixed, whereas the elasticity e1e;b must be measured while
permitting t to vary. Instead of attempting to estimate both parameters, Chetty used
numerical simulations to show that the effect of a UI benefit increase on job-finding rates
is virtually identical regardless of UI taxes being held fixed. This is because the fraction of
unemployed individuals is quite small, making UI tax rates very low.
Chetty implemented Equation 33 by estimating the effects of unemployment benefits
and severance payments on search intensity using hazard models for unemployment durations. He found that the welfare gains from raising the unemployment benefit level are
small but positive, suggesting that the current benefit level is slightly below the optimum
given the concavity of WðbÞ. He concluded that the optimal benefit level is close to the
current wage-replacement rate of approximately 50%.

5.4. Shimer & Werning (2007)
Shimer & Werning (2007) inferred the gap in marginal utilities from the comparative
statics of reservation wages instead of effort in a model of job search. They considered a
model in which the probability of finding a job, e, is determined by the agent’s decision to
accept or reject a wage offer rather than by search intensity. Wage offers are drawn from a
distribution FðwÞ. If the agent rejects the job offer, he receives income of wl þ b as in the
model above. For simplicity, assume that the agent has no private insurance ðq ¼ 1Þ;
allowing q51 complicates the algebra but does not affect the final formula. The remainder of the model is specified as in Equation 26.
The agent rejects any net-of-tax wage offer w  t below his outside option wl þ b.
Therefore, e ¼ 1  Fðwl þ b þ tÞ, and the agent’s expected value upon job loss is
WðbÞ ¼ eE½uðw  tÞjw  t > wl þ b þ ð1  eÞuðwl þ bÞ:
Even though the microeconomic choices of accepting or rejecting wage offers are discrete,
the welfare function is smooth because of aggregation, as in Equation 10.

large, positive value for MW ðbÞ at current benefit levels. However, they cautioned that the
credibility of existing reservation-wage elasticity estimates is questionable, particularly in
view of evidence that UI benefit levels have little impact on subsequent wage rates (e.g.,
Card et al. 2007, van Ours & Vodopivec 2008).
The multiplicity of formulas for MW ðbÞ illustrates a general feature of the sufficientstatistic approach: Because the model is not fully identified by the inputs to the formula,
there are generally several representations of the formula for welfare gains.20 This flexibility allows the researcher to apply the representation most suitable for his application given
the available variation and data. For example, in analyzing disability insurance, it may be
easiest to implement Chetty’s (2008) formula as the available variation permits the identification of liquidity and moral hazard effects (Autor & Duggan 2007).

5.5. Inefficiencies in Private Insurance
An important assumption made in all three formulas above is that the choices within the
private sector are constrained Pareto efficient; that is, total surplus is maximized in the
private sector subject to the constraints. In practice, private-insurance contracts are likely

18

Shimer & Werning studied a stationary dynamic model with constant absolute risk aversion utility where the
reservation wage is fixed over time, in which case it does not matter at what point of the spell the reservation wage
is elicited.

This corresponds to equation 12 in Shimer & Werning (2007), where the unemployment rate is u ¼ 1  e. The

20

All three formulas hold in models that allow both reservation wage and search intensity choices. Chetty’s (2006a)
generalization of Baily’s formula nests the model with stochastic wages. If agents control the arrival rate of offers via
search effort, the first-order condition for search effort remains the same as in Equation 30, with Eu0 (ch) replacing
u0 (ch). It follows that Chetty’s (2008) formula also holds with stochastic wages.

to be second-best inefficient as well because of adverse selection and moral hazard in
private markets. In this case, the envelope condition invoked in deriving Equation 27 is
violated because of externalities on the private insurer’s budget constraint that are not
taken into account by the individual.
Recent work by Einav et al. (2008b) and Chetty & Saez (2008) identified sufficient
statistics for the welfare gains from social insurance in environments with adverse selection and moral hazard in private-insurance markets. Einav et al. developed a method of
characterizing the welfare gain from government intervention that uses information about
insurance purchase decisions. They showed that the demand curve for private insurance
and the average cost of providing insurance as a function of the price are together sufficient statistics for welfare analysis. Einav et al. implemented their method using quasiexperimental price variation in health insurance policies and found that the welfare gains
from government intervention in health insurance markets are small.
Chetty & Saez focused on ex-post behaviors, namely how marginal utilities vary across
the high and low states, as in Baily’s formula. They developed a simple extension to
Gruber’s (1997) implementation of the formula that includes two more parameters: the
size of the private-insurance market and the crowdout of private insurance by public
insurance. Intuitively, the government exacerbates the moral hazard distortion created by
private insurance, and must therefore take into account the amount of private insurance
and degree of crowdout to calculate the welfare gains from intervention. Chetty & Saez
applied their formula to analyze health insurance, showing that naively applying Equation
27 dramatically overstates the welfare gains from government intervention in this case.
These examples illustrate that the sufficient-statistic approach can be extended to
environments in which private-sector choices are not second-best efficient. One has to
deviate slightly from the general rubric to handle such second-best inefficiencies because
the incentive compatibility constraints for private insurance violate Assumption 1. These
constraints lead to additional terms in the sufficient-statistic formula, increasing the number of moments that need to be estimated for welfare analysis.

6. APPLICATION 3: BEHAVIORAL MODELS
There is now considerable reduced-form evidence that individuals’ behavior deviates
systematically from the predictions of neoclassical perfect optimization models [see Table 1
for a few examples and DellaVigna’s (2009) review for many more]. In light of this
evidence, an important new challenge is normative analysis in models where agents’
choices deviate from perfect optimization. The budding literature on this topic has proposed some structural approaches to this issue, primarily in the context of time discounting. An early example is Feldstein’s (1985) model of social security with myopic agents, in
which individuals have a higher discount rate than the social planner. Feldstein numerically calculated the welfare gains from social security policies under various assumptions
about the primitives. More recently, a series of papers have used calibrations of Laibson’s
(1997) b-d model of hyperbolic discounting to make numerical predictions about optimal
policy for agents who are impatient (see Table 1). Another set of studies has modeled the
behavioral patterns identified in earlier work—such as ironing and spotlighting effects in
response to nonlinear price schedules—and simulated optimal tax policy in such models
(Liebman & Zeckhauser 2004, Feldman & Katuščák 2006).

The difficulty with the structural approach in behavioral applications is that there are
often multiple positive models that can explain deviations from rationality, and each
model can lead to different welfare predictions. The sufficient-statistic approach can be
useful in such situations because welfare analysis does not require full specification of the
positive model underlying observed choices (Bernheim & Rangel 2009). In applications in
which agents optimize, the main benefit of the sufficient-statistic approach is that it
simplifies identification. If one had unlimited power to identify primitives, there would
be no advantage to using the sufficient-statistic approach in such models. In nonoptimizing models, however, the sufficient-statistic strategy has value even if identification is not a
problem because there is no consensus alternative to the neoclassical model.
Given the infancy of this area, there is currently little work applying sufficient-statistic
approaches to behavioral models. However, this is a fertile area for further research, as
illustrated by Chetty et al.’s (2009) recent analysis of the welfare consequences of taxation
when agents optimize imperfectly with respect to taxes. These authors presented evidence
that the effect of commodity taxes on demand depends on whether the tax is included in
posted prices. Taxes that are not included in posted prices (and are hence less salient to
consumers) induce smaller demand reductions. There are various psychological and economic theories that could explain why salience affects behavioral responses to taxation,
including bounded rationality, forgetfulness, and cue theories of attention. Chetty et al.
therefore developed a sufficient-statistic approach to welfare analysis that is robust to
specifications of the positive theory of tax salience.
Chetty et al. characterized the efficiency costs and incidence of taxation in a two-good
model analogous to the Harberger model presented in Section 2. Let x denote the taxed
good and y the numeraire. The demand for x as a function of its pretax price and tax rate
is denoted by xðp; tÞ. I assume here that utility is quasilinear in y and production is
constant returns to scale. These assumptions simplify the exposition by eliminating income
effects and changes in producer prices; Chetty et al. showed that similar results are
obtained when these assumptions are dropped.
The agent’s true ranking of the consumption bundles ðx; yÞ is described by a smooth,
quasiconcave utility function
Uðx; yÞ ¼ uðxÞ þ y
¼ uðxÞ þ Z  ðp þ tÞx;
where the second line imposes that the allocation ðx; yÞ the agent chooses must satisfy the
true budget constraint ðp þ tÞx þ y ¼ Z. Chetty et al. departed from the traditional Harberger analysis by dropping the assumption that the consumption bundle ðx; yÞ is chosen
to maximize Uðx; yÞ. Instead, they took the demand function xðp; tÞ as an empirically
@x
estimated object generated by a model unknown to the policy maker, permitting @x
@p 6¼ @t .
To calculate excess burden, assume that tax revenue is returned to the agent as a lump
sum. Then, under the assumption that an individual’s utility is a function purely of her
ultimate consumption bundle, social welfare is given by
Wðp; tÞ ¼ fuðxÞ þ Z  ðp þ tÞxg þ TðtÞ;
where TðtÞ ¼ txðtÞ. In nonoptimizing models, one must deviate from step 2 of the rubric
in Section 3 at this point because the envelope condition used to derive Equation 14 does
not hold. Instead, totally differentiate the social-welfare function to obtain

This marginal-utility-based expression captures a simple intuition. An infinitesimal tax
increase reduces consumption of x by dx
dt . The loss in surplus from this reduction in consumption of x is given by the difference between willingness to pay for x [u0 ðxÞ] and the cost
of producing x, which equals the price p under the constant-returns-to-scale assumption.
Equation 35 applies in any model, irrespective of how xðp; tÞ is chosen. Given that dx
dt
can be estimated empirically, the challenge in calculating dW
dt (which reflects the main
challenge in behavioral public economics more generally) is the recovery of the true
preferences [u0 ðxÞ]. In neoclassical models, we use the optimality condition u0 ðxÞ ¼ p þ t
to recover marginal utility and immediately obtain the Harberger formula in Equation 4.
As we do not know how x is chosen, we cannot use this condition here. Chetty et al.
tackled this problem by making the following assumption.
Assumption 2: When tax-inclusive prices are fully salient, the agent chooses
the same allocation as a fully optimizing agent:
xðp; 0Þ ¼ arg max uðxÞ þ Z  px:
X

This assumption requires that the agent only makes mistakes with respect to taxes, and not
fully salient prices. To see why this assumption suffices to calculate welfare, let
PðxÞ ¼ x1 ðp; 0Þ denote the agent’s inverse-price-demand curve. Assumption 2 implies that
PðxÞ ¼ u0 ðxÞ via the first-order condition for xðp; 0Þ. Plugging this into Equation 35 yields

This formula for dW

burden in behavioral economics models. Intuitively, the tax-demand curve dx

determine the actual effect of the tax on behavior. Then, the price-demand curve ðdx
dpÞ is
used to calculate the effect of that change in behavior on welfare. The price-demand curve
can be used to recover the agent’s preferences and calculate welfare changes because it is
(by assumption) generated by optimizing behavior.
Because it does not rely on a specific structural model, Equation 36 accommodates
all errors in optimization with respect to taxes and is hence easily adaptable to other
applications. For example, confusion between average and marginal income-tax rates
(Liebman & Zeckhauser 2004, Feldman & Katuščák 2006) or overestimation of estate
tax rates (Slemrod 2006) can be handled using the same formula, without requiring
knowledge of individuals’ tax perceptions or rules of thumb. Any such behaviors are
reflected in the empirically observed tax and price elasticities.

In sum, one can make progress in behavioral welfare economics by making assumptions that narrow the class of models under consideration without fully specifying one
particular model. One is effectively forced to make stronger assumptions about the class of
models in exchange for relaxing the full optimization assumption. These stronger assumptions make it especially important to implement step 6 of the rubric (model evaluation) in
behavioral models. For instance, identifying the structural reasons for why tax salience
matters would cast light on the plausibility of Assumption 2.

7. CONCLUSION: OTHER APPLICATIONS

The literature reviewed in this article has focused on identifying sufficient statistics for
normative (welfare) analysis. Sufficient statistics can also be used to answer positive
(descriptive) questions. A simple example is predicting the effect of a tax change on tax
revenue. One only needs to estimate the elasticity of equilibrium quantity with respect to
the tax rate to answer this question. Another example is the literature on capitalization
effects (e.g., Summers 1981, Roback 1982, Greenstone & Gallagher 2008), which shows
that changes in asset prices are sufficient statistics for distributional incidence in dynamic
equilibrium models. The techniques relevant for positive analysis differ from those discussed in this article, as one cannot exploit envelope conditions in most positive applications. However, the general concept is still to formulate answers to questions in terms of a
few elasticities instead of a full primitive structure.
Although the sufficient-statistic approach has been most widely applied in the public
economics literature, it is natural to apply this approach in other areas. I conclude by
briefly discussing applications in other fields.

7.1. Macroeconomics
A central debate in macroeconomics is whether households adhere to the permanentincome hypothesis. The structural approach to answering this question, taken, for example, by Scholz et al. (2006), is to specify a dynamic model of optimization and test whether
observed consumption and savings patterns are consistent with those predicted by the
model. The sufficient-statistic counterpart to this approach is to isolate one moment, such
as the drop in consumption at retirement or the sensitivity of behavior to cash on hand,
that is adequate to test between models (e.g., see Aguiar & Hurst 2005, Card et al. 2007).
Similarly, models of business cycles and growth can be distinguished simply by identifying
the labor wedge (Shimer 2008).

7.2. Labor
Labor economists have studied the effects of minimum wages on employment and wages
extensively using reduced-form methods. Such evidence can be mapped into statements
about optimal policy using a sufficient-statistic approach (Lee & Saez 2008). Another
potential application is to the analysis of returns to schooling. Many studies have investigated the effects of schooling on behaviors such as job mobility and occupation choice.
A sufficient-statistic approach would intuitively suggest that examining effects on total
482

earnings is adequate to measure the benefits of additional schooling in a model in which
agents optimize.

7.3. Development
Starting with Townsend (1994), a large literature in development has studied risk-sharing
arrangements. Although it is informative to understand the mechanisms through which
shocks are smoothed, identifying consumption fluctuations and risk aversion is sufficient to
make inferences about the welfare costs of shocks (Chetty & Looney 2006). Hence, quasiexperimental evidence such as that of Gertler & Gruber’s (2002) study of health shocks in
Indonesia sheds light on welfare and optimal policy even though it does not fully characterize the structure of insurance and risk-sharing networks. More generally, one may be able
to give precise answers to policy questions using estimates from randomized experiments
coupled with sufficient-statistic formulas derived from standard structural models.

7.4. Industrial Organization
Weyl & Fabinger (2009) showed that estimates of the pass through of cost shocks are
sufficient statistics for questions ranging from the effects of mergers on markups to the
effects of price caps on market structure. Researchers who seek to develop sufficientstatistic approaches to other problems in industrial organization (IO) must confront two
challenges. First, many questions of interest concern discrete changes such as antitrust
policy or the introduction of a new product. Second, much of the IO literature focuses on
models of strategic interaction rather than price theory. In strategic games, small changes
in exogenous parameters can lead to jumps in behavior. Because the techniques used in this
article rely on smoothness, one may need to develop different techniques to apply the
sufficient-statistic approach to IO problems. These are interesting topics for further research at the interface of structural and reduced-form methods.
