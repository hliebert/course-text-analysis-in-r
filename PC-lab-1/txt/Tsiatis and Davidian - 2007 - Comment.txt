Comment: Demystifying Double
Robustness: A Comparison of Alternative
Strategies for Estimating a Population
Mean from Incomplete Data
Anastasios A. Tsiatis and Marie Davidian
INTRODUCTION
We congratulate Drs. Kang and Schafer (KS hence

Throughout, we use the same notation as in the pa

per.

forth) for a careful and thought-provoking contribution

to the literature regarding the so-called "double robust
ness" property, a topic that still engenders some con
fusion and disagreement. The authors' approach of fo

cusing on the simplest situation of estimation of the
population mean /x of a response y when y is not ob

served on all subjects according to a missing at ran
dom (MAR) mechanism (equivalently, estimation of
the mean of a potential outcome in a causal model un
der the assumption of no unmeasured confounders) is

commendable, as the fundamental issues can be ex

plored without the distractions of the messier notation

and considerations required in more complicated set
tings. Indeed, as the article demonstrates, this simple
setting is sufficient to highlight a number of key points.

As noted eloquently by Molenberghs (2005), in
regard to how such missing data/causal inference
problems are best addressed, two "schools" may be
identified: the "likelihood-oriented" school and the
"weighting-based" school. As we have emphasized
previously (Davidian, Tsiatis and Leon, 2005), we pre
fer to view inference from the vantage point of semi
parametric theory, focusing on the assumptions em
bedded in the statistical models leading to different

"types" of estimators (i.e., "likelihood-oriented" or
"weighting-based") rather than on the forms of the esti
mators themselves. In this discussion, we hope to com

plement the presentation of the authors by elaborating
on this point of view.

SEMIPARAMETRIC THEORY PERSPECTIVE
As demonstrated by Robins, Rotnitzky and Zhao
(1994) and Tsiatis (2006), exploiting the relationship
between so-called influence functions and estimators
is a fruitful approach to studying and contrasting the
(large-sample) properties of estimators for parameters
of interest in a statistical model. We remind the reader
that a statistical model is a class of densities that could

have generated the observed data. Our presentation
here is for scalar parameters such as /x, but gener
alizes readily to vector-valued parameters. If one re
stricts attention to estimators that are regular (i.e., not

"pathological"; see Davidian, Tsiatis and Leon, 2005,
page 263 and Tsiatis 2006, pages 26-27), then, for
a parameter ? in a parametric or semiparametric sta
tistical model, an estimator /x for ? based on inde
pendent and identically distributed observed data z?,

i = 1, ..., ft, is said to be asymptotically linear if it

properties. Many of the estimators discussed by KS are
regular and asymptotically linear; in the sequel, we re
fer to regular and asymptotically linear estimators as
simply "estimators."
We capitalize on this connection by considering the
problem of estimating ?jl in the setting in KS in terms of

statistical models that may be assumed for the observed
data, from which influence functions corresponding to
estimators valid under the assumed models may be de

All of I?III are semiparametric statistical models in
that some aspects of p(z) are left unspecified. Denote

by mo(x) the true function E(y\x) and by tto(x) the
true function P(t ? l\x) = E(t\x) corresponding to
the true density po(z).
Semiparametric theory yields the form of all influ
ence functions corresponding to estimators for ? un
der each of the statistical models I?III. As discussed in

Tsiatis (2006, page 52), loosely speaking, a consistent

rived. In the situation studied by KS, the "full" data
that would ideally be observed are (t,x,y); however,

and asymptotically normal estimator for ? in a statisti

as y is unobserved for some subjects, the observed data

of densities defined by the model, nl/2(? ? ?) ->

available for analysis are z = (t,x, ty). As noted by
KS, the MAR assumption states that y and t are condi

tionally independent given x; for example, P(t ? 1|

j,x) = P(t = l\x). Under this assumption, all joint

densities for the observed data have the form

(2) p(z) = p(y\x)I^t=^p(t\x)p(x),
where p(y\x) is the density of y given x, p(t\x) is the
density of t given x, and p(x) is the marginal density
of x. Let po(z) be the density in the class of densities
of form (2) generating the observed data (the true joint

density).
One may posit different statistical models by making
different assumptions on the components of (2). We fo
cus on three such models:

I. Make no assumptions on the forms of p(x) or
p(t\x), leaving these entirely unspecified. Make
a specific assumption on p(y\x), namely, that

E(y\x) = m(x,?) for some given function

m(x, ?) depending on parameters ? (p x 1). De
note the class of densities satisfying these assump

tions as M?.
II. Make no assumptions on the forms of p(x) or
p(y\x). Make a specific assumption on p(t\x)

that P(t = l\x) = E(t\x) = n(x,a) for some

given function n(x,a) depending on parameters a
(s x 1). Here, we also require the assumption that
P(t = l\x) > s > 0 for all x and some s. Denote
the class of densities satisfying these assumptions

as Mu.

III. Make no assumptions on the form of p(x), but
make specific assumptions on p(y\x) and p(t\x),
namely, that E(y\x) = m(x, ?) and P(t ? \\x) =
E(t\x) = tt(x, a) > s > 0 for all x and some s for
given functions m(x, ?) and n(x, a) depending on
parameters ? and a. The class of densities satisfy
ing these assumptions is Mi O Mu.

cal model has the property that, for all p(z) in the class

oV"{0, <j2(p)}, where -> means convergence in distri
bution under the density p(z), and a2(p) is the asymp
totic variance of ?2 under p(z).

If model I is correct, then mo(x) = m(x,?) for
some ?, and it may be shown (e.g., Tsiatis, 2006, Sec
tion 4.5) that all estimators for ? have influence func
tions of the form

(3) mo(x) ? ? + ta(x){y - m?(x)}
for arbitrary functions a(x) of x. If model II is correct,
then 7To(x) = n(x, a) for some a, and all estimators for
? have influence functions of the form

(4) ?? +-?? h(x) - ?
7To(x) 7To(x)

for arbitrary h(x), which is well known from R
Rotnitzky and Zhao (1994). If model III is correc

for arbitrary a(x) and h(x). Depending on forms of
m(x, ?) as a function of ? and n(x,a) as a function
of a, there will be restrictions on the forms of a(x) and

h(x); see below.

We now consider estimators discussed by KS from
the perspective of influence functions. The regression

estimator ?oLS in (7) of KS comes about naturally
if one assumes model I is correct. In terms of influ
ence functions, ?ois may be motivated by consider
ing the influence function (3) with a(x) = 0, as this
leads to the estimator rTl Y^=\m(xi^ ?)- In fact> al~
though KS do not discuss it, the "imputation estima

be motivated by taking a(x) ? 1 in (3). Of course,

that mo(x) = m(x, ?o).

The IPW estimator ?Xipw-pop m (3) of KS and
its variants arise if one assumes model II. In par
ticular, ?Xipw-pop can be motivated via the influence

function (4) with h(x) = ? ?. The estimator ?Xipw-nr
in (4) of KS follows from (4) with h(x) = -E[y{\ -

7t(x)}]/E[{l ? n(x)}]. In fact, if one restricts h(x)

jzq(x) =Tc(x,ao).

Doubly robust (DR) estimators are estimators that
are consistent and asymptotically normal for models
in M i U Mu, that is, under the assumptions of model I

or model II. When the true density po(z) Mi D Mp,
then the influence function of any such DR estimator

must be equal to (3) with a(x) = l/jro(x) or, equiva
lently, equal to (4) with h(x) = ?mo(x). Accordingly,
when po(z) Mi D Mp, that is, both models have been
specified correctly, all such DR estimators will have
the same asymptotic variance. This also implies that,
if both models are correctly specified, the asymptotic
properties of the estimator do not depend on the meth

ods used to estimate ? and a.

KS discuss strategies for constructing DR esti
mators, and they present several specific examples:

?BC-OLS in their equation (8); the estimators be

low (8) using POP or NR weights, which we denote as
?BC-POP and ?BC-NR> respectively; the estimator ?wis

in their equation (10); ?^-cov in their equation (12);
and a version of ?n~Cov equal to the estimator proposed
by Scharf stein, Rotnitzky and Robins (1999) and Bang

in (4) to be a constant, then, using the fact that the ex

and Robins (2005), which we denote as ?isrr. The re

pectation of the square of (4) is the asymptotic vari
ance of the estimator, one may find the "best" such
constant minimizing the variance as h{x) = ? E[y{\ ?

scenarios (Mi H Mp) in Tables 5-8 of KS are consis

it(x)}/it(x)}/E[{\ ?n(x)}/7t(x)]. An estimator based
on this idea was given in (10) of Lunceford and Da
vidian (2004, page 2943). In general, as for model I,
(4) implies that all estimators for ? that are consis
tent and asymptotically normal if model II is correct
must be asymptotically equivalent to an estimator of

the form

?q\ -i\M tiyi ti-ix(xi,a)T |

(g) n 2J~7?^ +-?~zzr-~h(xi)\,

where a is estimated by solving an equation of the

sults for these estimators under the "Correct-Correct"
tent with the asymptotic properties above. We note that

?n-cov is not DR under Mi U Mp because of the addi
tional assumption that the mean of y given it must be
equal to a linear combination of basis functions in it.

Making this additional assumption may not be unrea
sonable in practice; however, strictly speaking, it takes

?n-cov outside the class of DR estimators discussed
here, and hence we do not consider it in the remainder
of this section. However, ??srr is still in this class.

KS suggest that a characteristic distinguishing the
performance of DR estimators is whether or not the
estimator is within or outside the augmented inverse
probability weighted (AIPW) class. We find this dis

nary regression. As above, because a is estimated, the

tinction artificial, as all of the above estimators

catenated by an additional element, the coefficient of
7T--1. The A(x, ?) for ?2srr thus involves a design ma
trix that is unstable for small 7?/, consistent with the
comment of KS at the end of their Section 3.

In summary, we believe that studying the perfor
mance of estimators via their influence functions can
provide useful insights. Our preceding remarks refer to

performance, which depends directly on
where we write Jr; ? 7t(a:/, c?) and m; ? m{xi, ?) large-sample
for

the influence function. Estimators with the same influ
brevity. For /?wls and /xs##, this identity follows from

the fact that Y?=\ ??(yi ~ i) = 0? which for /xWLiS

holds because KS restrict to m(x, ?) = xT?, with x
including a constant term. Thus, we contend that is
sues of performance under Mi U Mu are not linked
to whether or not a DR estimator is AIPW, but, rather,

are a consequence of forms of the influence functions

of estimators under Mi or Mu. In particular, under
model II, it follows that the above estimators have in

ence function can exhibit different finite-sample prop
erties. It may be possible via higher-order expansions
to gain an understanding of some of this behavior; to
the best of our knowledge, this is an open question.

BOTH MODELS INCORRECT
The developments in the previous section are rele

fluence functions of the form (4) with h(x) equal to (9)

vant in Mi U Mp. Key themes of KS are performance
of DR and other estimators outside this class; that is,

with h(x) = -{y* + m(x, /}*)}, where y* and ?* are

when both the models n(x, a) and m(x, ?) are incor

the limits in probability of y and ?, respectively. Thus,
features determining performance of these estimators

rectly specified, and choice of estimator under these

when model II is correct are how close y* + m(x, ?*)
is to mo 00 and how a is estimated, where maximum
likelihood is the optimal choice. In fact, this perspec
tive reveals that, for fixed m(x, ?), using ideas similar
to those in Tan (2006), the optimal choice of y is as in

circumstances.

One way to study performance in this situation is
through simulation. KS have devised a very interesting

Ybc-nr with ti(l- 7t i) I t? i replaced by ?/(l - ?i)/?f.

and instructive specific simulation scenario that high
lights some important features of various estimators.
In particular, the KS scenario emphasizes the difficul
ties encountered with some of the DR estimators when

these estimators are of the form (3) with a(x) equal
to (7) with 500 = if\/7T(x,a*) + 1/^2, where a* is
the limit in probability of a and 1/^1 = 1 and ^2 = 0
for ?Xbc-ols, ?Xwls and ?XSrr\ ^1 = \/E{no(x)/n(x,
a*)} and ^2 = 0 for ?Xbc-pop\ and \?/\ and ^2 for

quently, estimators like ?2ols rely on extrapolation into

Similarly, under model I, the influence functions of

?Xbc-nr are more complicated expectations involving
7io00 and n (x, a*). Thus, under model I, features de
termining performance of these estimators are the form
of a 00 and how ? is estimated through the choice of

A(x,?).

We may interpret some of the results in Tables 5,

6 and 8 of KS in light of these observations. Un
der the "7T-model Correct-y-model Incorrect" scenario
(Mu H Mcj), ?Xbc-ols, ?Xwls and ?XSrr show some non
trivial differences in performance, which, from above,
are likely attributable to differences in m(x, /?*). Under

the "7T-model Incorrect-);-model Correct" (M? H Mcu),
all three estimators share the same a(x) but use differ
ent methods to estimate ?, so that any differences are

jz(xi, a) is small for some x?. Indeed, in our expe
rience, poor performance of DR and IPW estimators
in practice can result from few small n(xi,?). When
there are small n(xi,a), as noted KS, responses are
not observed for some portion of the x space. Conse
that part of the x space. KS have constructed a sce
nario where failure to observe j in a portion of the x
space can wreak havoc on some estimators that make
use of the tt(x? , a) but has minimal impact on the qual
ity of extrapolations for these x based on m(x, ?). One

could equally well build a scenario where the x for
which _y is unobserved are highly influential for the re
gression m(x, ?) and hence could result in deleterious
performance of ?1ols> We thus reiterate the remark of
KS that, although simulations can be illuminating, they
cannot yield broadly applicable conclusions.
Given this, we offer some thoughts on other strate

gies for deriving estimators that may have some ro
bustness properties under the foregoing conditions, that

is, offer good performance outside M\ U Mp. One ap

proach may be to search outside the class of DR es
timators valid under Mi U Mp. For example, as sug
gested by the simulations of KS, estimators in the spirit

of ?n-cov, which impose additional assumptions ren
dering them DR in the strict sense only in a subset
of Mi U Mp, may compensate for this restriction by
yielding more robust performance outside Mi U Mp;
further study along these lines would be interesting. An
alternative tactic for searching outside Mi U Mp may
be to consider the form of influence functions (5) for

estimators valid under Mi H Mp. For instance, a "hy
brid" estimator of the form

longer be applicable. It may be necessary to use higher
order asymptotic theory to make progress in this di

rection; see, for example, Robins and van der Vaart

(2006).

CONCLUDING REMARKS
We again compliment the authors for their thought
ful and insightful article, and we appreciate the oppor
tunity to offer our perspectives on this important prob

lem. We look forward to new methodological devel
opments that may overcome some of the challenges
brought into focus by KS in their article.
