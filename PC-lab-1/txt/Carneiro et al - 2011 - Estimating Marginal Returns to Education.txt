Estimating Marginal Returns to Education1
By Pedro Carneiro, James J. Heckman, and Edward J. Vytlacil*

Estimating marginal returns to policies is a central task of economic cost-benefit
analysis. A comparison between marginal benefits and marginal costs determines
the optimal size of a social program. For example, to evaluate the optimality of a
policy that promotes expansion in college attendance, analysts need to estimate the
return to college for the marginal student and compare it to the marginal cost of the

policy.
This is a relatively simple task (i) if the effect of the policy is the same for every

one (conditional on observed variables) or (ii) if the effect of the policy varies across
individuals given observed variables but agents either do not know their idiosyn
cratic returns to the policy, or if they know them, they do not act on them. In these

cases, individuals do not choose their schooling based on their realized idiosyncratic
individual returns, and thus the marginal and average ex post returns to schooling
are the same.1

Under these conditions, the mean marginal return to college can be estimated
using conventional methods applied to the following Mincer equation:

The recent literature shows how to empirically test the conditions that justify

application of conventional methods (Heckman, Daniel Schmierer, and Sergio
Urzua 2010; Heckman and Schmierer 2010). Applying these methods on data from
the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth of 1979 (NLSY), we find that returns
vary (i.e., (3 is random) and, furthermore, agents act as if they possess some knowl
edge of their idiosyncratic returns (i.e., f3 is correlated with S). Selection on gains
complicates the estimation of marginal returns.

Under assumptions presented in Guido W. Imbens and Joshua D. Angrist
(1994), an instrumental variable estimator identifies a local average treatment
effect (LATE), which measures the return to college for individuals induced to go
to school by the change in the instrument. Unfortunately, the people induced to go
to school by a change in an instrument need not be the same as the people induced
to go to school by a given policy change, and the returns to the two groups of
people can differ substantially, as we illustrate in this paper. We show how to use a
local version of instrumental variables introduced in Heckman and Vytlacil (1999,
2005, 2007b) to estimate the marginal returns to alternative ways of producing
marginal expansions in college attendance without requiring that the variation in
the available instruments correspond exactly to the variation induced by a policy.
For a sample of white males from the NLSY, we establish that marginal expan
sions in college attendance attract students with lower returns than those enjoyed
by persons currently attending college. The contrast between what conventional IV
measures and the marginal return to a policy can be stark. For example, while the
conventional IV estimate is 0.0951, the estimated marginal return to a policy that
expands each individual's probability of attending college by the same proportion is
only 0.0148. This policy induces students who should not attend college to attend it.2
The methods used in this paper improve on LATE by identifying what sections

of an economically interpretable mean marginal benefit surface are identified by
different instruments. It is thus possible to compare on a common scale the differ
ent margins identified by different instruments. Furthermore, our methods allow
the evaluation of policy changes that do not directly correspond to current varia
tion in any particular instrument and are thus not directly identified by standard IV
procedures.
The plan of this paper is as follows. In the next section, we present the empiri
cal framework used in this paper. The following section discusses the estimation
method and presents empirical estimates and robustness checks. The final section
concludes.

to be correct.

outcomes as

(2) Yx = /i,(X) + £/, and 70 = Mo(X) + U0,
where /^(x) = E(YX |X = x) and /j0(x) = E(Y0\X = x). The return to schooling is
Yx — F0 = (3 = /i,(X) — fi0(X) + Ux — t/0, so that the average treatment effect

conditional on X = x is given by /3(x) = E(/3 |X = x) = /i,(x) — n0(x) and the
average effect of treatment on those who choose to attend college conditional on

X = x is given by E{/3|X = x,S = 1) = /?(x) + E(UX - U0\S = 1,X = x). X
need not be statistically independent of (U0, Ux). We condition on X throughout.
A standard latent variable discrete choice model represents the individual's deci

sion to enroll in college (see, e.g., Willis and Rosen 1979). Let Is be the net benefit
to the individual of enrolling in college, which depends on observed (Z) and unob
served (V) variables:

is central to our analysis of how to go from (local) IV estimates to policy effects.
This parameter was introduced in the literature by Anders Bjorklund and Moffitt

(1987) and extended in Heckman and Yytlacil (1999, 2001a, 2005, 2007b). It is
the mean return to schooling for individuals with characteristics X = x and U
= us. Recall that Us has been normalized to be unit uniform, so that tracing MTE

over us values shows how the returns to schooling vary with different quantiles of

the unobserved component of the index of the desire to go to college. Alternatively
it is the mean return to schooling for persons indifferent between going to college or

not who have mean scale utility value P(Z) = us.
The MTE can be estimated by the method of local instrumental variables pro

posed by Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2001a, 2005), which we implement in this
paper. It is identified by differentiating £(F|X = x,P(Z) = p) with respect to p,
which can be computed over the support of the distribution of P(Z). Using the equa
tions in (2), observed earnings are

(4) Y = (5)F, + (1 - S)Y0
= //0(X) + [pl (X) - Mo(X) + Ux- U0]s + U0
= Mo(X) + MX) - Mo(X)]S + {U0 + 5(£/, - £/„)}■
The conditional expectation of Y given X = x and P(Z) = p is

E(Y\X = x,P{ Z) = p) = £(F0|X = x,P{ Z) = p)
+ E(YX - Y0|X = x,S = 1,P(Z) - p)p.
Using choice equation (3), this expression can be written as

(5) E(Y\X = x,P(Z) = p)

= MoW + [MiW - Mo(x)lP

fying the expression,

£(y|X = x,P(Z) = p) = Mo(x) + fQ MTE(x,us) dus.

5 We are assuming in this derivation that U\ - Ua is a continuous random variable. However, the result holds
under more general conditions. See Heckman andVytlacil (2001a, 2005) and Heckman, Urzua, andVytlacil (2006).

mr\z = *rm = P) _
dp

Applied to sample data, this is the local instrumental variable (LIV) estimator of
Heckman and Vytlacil (1999). We can recover the return to schooling for persons
indifferent between 5=1 and S = 0 at all margins of Us within the empirical sup
port of P(Z) (conditional on X). Notice that persons with a high mean scale utility
function P(Z) identify the return for those with a high value of Us, i.e., a value of
Us that makes persons less likely to participate in schooling. Marginal increases in
P(Z) starting from high values of P(Z) induce those individuals with high Us values
into schooling. Those with low values of Us are already in school for such values of
P(Z) so that a marginal increase in P(Z) starting from a high value has no effect on
them. We can identify returns at all quantiles of Us within the support of the distribu

tion of P(Z). Thus, we can determine which persons (identified by the quantile of
the unobserved component of the desire to go to college, Us) are induced to go into

college (S = 1) by a marginal change in P(Z).
As noted by Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil (2006), the probability of selection
(P(Z)), sometimes called the "propensity score," plays a central role in instrumen
tal variable models that satisfy the independence and monotonicity conditions of
Imbens and Angrist (1994) (or equivalently that are characterized by the latent vari
able discrete choice model of equation (3)). Aggregating the instruments into the
scalar index P(Z) enlarges the range of values over which we can identify MTE in
comparison to using each instrument one at a time.6 One can also determine the con
tribution of each instrument to identifying different regions of the MTE function.

Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2001a, 2005, 2007a, b) establish that standard sum
mary measures of the return to college, such as the average return to college in the
population {E(/3\ X)) and the average return to college among those who attend col
lege (E((3\X, S = 1)), can be expressed as different weighted averages of the MTE.
They show that treatment parameter j, Ay-(x), can be written as a weighted average
of the MTE:

(7) A,(x) = i: MTE (x, us) hj (x, us) dus.
See Table A- IB in the online Appendix for the weights for different treatment param
eters in the literature. Heckman and Vytlacil also show that the standard IV estimator

6In the case of multiple instruments when fi is correlated with S, the common practice of using one instrument
at a time to identify the marginal effect of that instrument (e.g., David Card 1999, 2001) is fraught with danger. It
is necessary to account for the variation in other instruments associated with the variation in the instrument used in

order to isolate the ceteris paribus effect of any particular instrument. Thus, if Z = (Z,,..., ZK) and K > 2, comput
ing the LATE for Z| not controlling for Z1,...,ZK produces the direct effect of Z, on 5 as it affects Y, as well as the
effect produced by varying Z2,... ,ZK and their effects on S and hence Y if they covary with Z,. Aggregating all Z
into P(Z), and looking at the effect of variations in P(Z) on outcomes, avoids this problem. From the economics of
the problem, all Z enter choices through their effects on P(Z). See Heckman (2010) for a discussion of this issue.

where, again, the weights can be consistently estimated from sample data.7 Observe

that if MTE (x, us) does not depend on us, all instruments estimate the same param
eter which is f3(x), the average treatment effect. In this case, marginal and average ex

post returns are equal, and all IVs estimate a common policy effect that is the same

no matter how P(Z) is varied by policy shifts. The instrumental variable weights
arise because different values of the instruments identify different segments of the
MTE and IV averages out the different values using weight hk(x,us). The explicit
formula for the IV weight is given in online Appendix Table A-IB.8 In general, the
IV weights are different from the treatment parameter weights.

A. Policy Relevant Treatment Effects and
Marginal Policy Relevant Treatment Effects

Following Heckman and Vytlacil (2001b, 2005, 2007b), we consider a class of
policies that change P(Z), the probability of participation in the program, but that do

not affect potential outcomes or the unobservables related to the selection process,

(Fo, Fb V).9 An example from the literature on the economic returns to schooling
would be policies that change tuition or distance to school, but that do not directly
affect potential wages (Card 2001).10
Let S* be the treatment choice that would be made after the policy change. Let P*
be the corresponding probability that S* = 1 after the policy change. S* is defined

by S* = I [P* > Us]. Let Y* = S*F, + (1 — S*) Y0 be the outcome under the alterna
tive policy. Heckman and Vytlacil (2005, 2007b) show that the mean effect of going
from a baseline policy to an alternative policy per net person shifted is the policy
relevant treatment effect (PRTE), defined when E(S) ^ E(S*) as

E(Y\ Alternative Policy) - E(Y\Baseline Policy)
E (S* | Alternative Policy) — E(S\ Baseline Policy)

= EE(s] - fiS) = Jo MTE("^prteK) dus.

7 The weights integrate to one, no matter what the instrument, but they need not be positive at all values of us.

Heckman and Vytlacil (2005, 2007b).

where FP» and FP are the distributions of P* and P, respectively, and we suppress X

to simplify notation. The condition E(S) 7^ E(S*) is consistent with the policy hav
ing a nonmonotonic effect on participation, as long as the fraction switching into
treatment is not exactly offset by the fraction switching out of treatment. The PRTE

parameter gives the normalized effect of a change from a baseline policy to an alter
native policy and depends on the alternative being considered.11
As shown by the above equation, PRTE depends on the policy change only through
the distribution of P* after the policy change. In other words, given our assumptions,

FP• is sufficient to summarize everything about the proposed policy change that is
relevant for calculating the average effect of the policy change. The PRTE maps the
proposed policy change (corresponding to a distribution of P*) to the resulting per
person change in outcomes. In general, the PRTE for a proposed policy change of
interest will differ from the probability limit of an IV estimator. The change in the

distribution of P induced by the policy in general differs from the change induced
by an instrument, unless the instrument is the policy change. For example, policy
variations in tuition will not, in general, have the same effects as instrument varia
tions in distance to college.
The PRTE is defined for a discrete change from a baseline policy to a fixed alter
native. As noted in Carneiro, Heckman, and Vytlacil (2010), identifying it in any
sample can be a challenging task because it often requires that the support of P(Z)
be the full unit interval. Below, we show that our estimated P(Z) does not satisfy
this requirement. Instead, we estimate a marginal version of the PRTE parameter
(MPRTE) that corresponds to a marginal change from a baseline policy. It is less
empirically demanding to estimate, yet answers an economically interesting ques
tion. The marginal version of the PRTE depends on the nature of the perturbation that

defines the marginal change. For example, a policy change that subsidizes tuition
by a fixed amount and a policy change that subsidizes tuition so that the probability
of college-going expands proportionately will, in general, have different limits for
infinitesimally small subsidies (Carneiro, Heckman, and Vytlacil 2010).
More formally, we define the MPRTE as follows. Consider a sequence of policies
indexed by a scalar variable a, with a = 0 denoting the baseline, status quo policy.
We associate with each policy a the corresponding fitted probability of schooling Pa,
where P0 = P(Z), the baseline propensity score. For each policy a we define the
corresponding PRTE parameter for going from the baseline status quo to policy

a. We define the MPRTE as the limit of such a sequence of PRTEs as a goes to
zero. We will consider the following examples of such sequences of policies: (i) a
policy that increases the probability of attending college by an amount a, so that
Pa — Pq -f- ol and Fa(t) = F0(t — a); (ii) a policy that changes each person's prob

ability of attending college by the proportion (1 + a), so that Pa = (1 + a)P0 and
Fa(t) = F0(t/(l + a)); and (iii) a policy intervention that has an effect similar to a
shift in one of the components of Z, say ZH, so that ZjJ' = Zw + a and Z$ = Zw
for j 7^ k. For example, the /:th element of Z might be college tuition, and the policy

"The PRTE can be interpreted as an economically more explicit version of James Stock's (1989) nonparamet
ric policy analysis parameter for a class of policy interventions with explicit agent preferences, where the policies

evaluated operate solely on agent choice sets. The condition E(S) ^ E(S*) is not required if we define PRTE using
aggregates not normalized to a per capita basis (see Heckman and Vytlacil 2001b).

under consideration subsidizes college tuition by the fixed amount a. In each of
these three cases, we consider the corresponding PRTE for going from the status quo
to policy a, and consider the limit of such PRTEs as a goes to zero. These limits dif
fer from IV estimates in general. Just as IV is a weighted average of the MTE, as in
equation (8), there is a similar expression for average marginal policy changes that
weights up the MTE by the proportion of persons induced to change by the policy.
In general, the weights are different for IV and MPRTE. (Compare the IV weights in
Table A-IB in the online Appendix and the weights in Table 1 in the text.)
The MPRTE is the appropriate parameter with which to conduct cost-benefit anal
ysis of marginal policy changes. In our empirical work we contrast our estimates of
the MPRTE with conventional IV estimates of the returns to college.

Carneiro, Heckman, and Vytlacil (2010) relate the MPRTE to the average mar
ginal treatment effect (AMTE): the mean benefit of treatment for people indifferent

between participation in treatment and nonparticipation. There are technical issues
that arise in identifying the marginal gain to persons in indifference sets that arise
from the thinness of the indifference sets. For conventional economic models, the

probability that anyone is indifferent is exactly zero. Different ways to approxi
mate the indifference set P(Z) = Us through limit operations determine different
values of the AMTE. The effect of a marginal policy change for a particular pertur
bation of P(Z) is the same as the average effect of treatment for those who are arbi
trarily close to being indifferent between treatment or not, using a metric m(P, Us)

measuring the distance between P(Z) and Us. This parameter is defined as
AMTE = limEfK, - YQ\m(P, Us) < e\. For the three examples of MPRTE previ
ously discussed, the corresponding metrics defining the AMTE are, respectively:

(i)m(P, Us) = |Fy\P) - Fy\Us) | = |ms(Z) - V|;(ii)m(P,t/s) = \P - Us|;(iii)
m(P, Us) = | (P/Us) - 11. Table 1 shows the different weights associated with the
different definitions of the AMTE and the associated MPRTE.

B. Practical Issues in Estimating the MPRTE
In practice, it is very difficult to condition on X nonparametrically, especially
when X includes many variables (as is the case in our empirical work). Therefore, in
our empirical work we proceed by imposing an additional assumption, which is stan
dard in the literature applying both IV and selection models to estimate the returns
to schooling: that (X,Z) is independent of (U0, Ux, Us) (as opposed to the weaker
assumption that (U0, Ux, Us) is independent of Z given X). Under this assumption the
MTE is additively separable in X and Us. One important consequence of imposing

this assumption is that the MTE is identified over the unconditional support of P, as
opposed to the support of P conditional on X. We discuss this assumption further in
Section IIC below.

In our empirical analysis, we work with linear-in-the-parameters versions of

^(X), /i0(X), and p,s(Z): /i,(X) = X<51; p0(X) = X<50, ps(Z) = Z7. In this case,

(9) £"(r|X = x,P(Z) = p) = x60 + px[5x - <50] + K{p),
where K(p) = E{JJX — U0\ S = 1,P(Z) = p) can be estimated nonparametrically. It

is straightforward to estimate the levels and derivatives of £(F|X = x,P(Z) = p)
and their standard errors using the methods developed in Heckman et al. (1998).
An alternative to the semiparametric model just described is to invoke parametric
assumptions on the joint distribution of (U0, Ux, V) and derive the expression for the

MTE (see Heckman, Justin L. Tobias, and Vytlacil 2001; Arild Aakvik, Heckman,
and Vytlacil 2005). Below, we also present estimates based on the assumption that
(U0, Uh V) is jointly normally distributed and independent of (X, Z). Following con

ventions in discrete choice analysis (McFadden 1974), we normalize the variance
of V to 1. In this case:

(10) MTE(x,us) = x(6i - 60) + E(U, - U0\US = us)

= x(5, - S0) + E(Ui - U0\V = *-\us))
— x(5j — 50) — (alv — cr0v)$ '("5),
where crlv = Cov(Uh V), aov = Cov(U0, V), and where $"'(■) is the inverse of the
standard normal cumulative distribution function. The parameters (<50, <5],<rlv., <r0V/)

and their standard errors can be estimated by maximum likelihood with the result
ing parameter estimates plugged into equation (10) to form an estimate of the MTE.
II. Estimates of the MTE and Comparison of Marginal Returns,
Policy Relevant Returns, and IV Estimands
A. Data

This section reports estimates of the MTE using a sample of white males from
the NLSY. The data are described in the online Appendix. Individuals are separated
into two groups: 5 = 0 (high school dropouts and high school graduates) and S = 1
(individuals with some college, college graduates, and postgraduates). Below, we
study the sensitivity of our estimates to alternative definitions of schooling groups,

aWe use a measure of this score corrected for the effect of schooling attained by the participant at the date of th
test, since at the date the test was taken, in 1981, different individuals have different amounts of schooling and the
effect of schooling on AFQT scores is important. We use a correction based on the method developed in Karsten T
Hansen, Heckman, and Kathleen J. Mullen (2004). We take the sample of white males, perform this correction, an

county of residence at age 17.12

Distance to college was first used as an instrument for schooling by Card (1995

and was subsequently used by Thomas J. Kane and Cecilia Elena Rouse (1995)
Jeffrey R. Kling (2001), Janet Currie and Enrico Moretti (2003), and Camero
and Taber (2004). Cameron and Taber (2004) and Carneiro and Heckman (2002

show that distance to college in the NLSY79 is correlated with a measure of ability

(Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT)). In this paper, we include this measure
of ability in the outcome equation.
Cameron and Heckman (1998,2001) and the papers they cite emphasize the impor
tance of controlling for local labor market characteristics (see also Cameron and Taber

2004). If local unemployment and local earnings at age 17 are correlated with the
unobservables in the earnings equations in the adult years, our measures of local labor

market conditions would not be valid instruments. To mitigate this concern, we hav

included measures of permanent local labor market conditions (which we define as

the average earnings and unemployment between 1973 and 2000 for each location o

residence at 17) both in the selection and outcome equations. Effectively, we use onl
the innovations in the local labor market variables as instruments. This is similar to

the procedure used by Cameron and Taber (2004). Further, in the outcome equation
we also include the average log earnings in the county of residence in 1991, and th
average unemployment rate in the state of residence in 1991.13

Tuition is used to predict college attendance in Cameron and Heckman (1998
2001) and Kane and Rouse (1995). We control for AFQT and maternal educatio

12We have constructed both county and state measures of unemployment, but our state measure has better pre
dictive power for schooling (perhaps because of less measurement error), and therefore we choose to use it inste
of county unemployment.
13 As Cameron and Taber (2004) argue, the sign of the total impact of these variables on schooling choice is the
retically ambiguous. Local labor market conditions can influence schooling through two possible channels. On the
one hand, better labor market conditions increase the opportunity costs of schooling and reduce educational atta
ment. On the other hand, better labor market conditions lead to an increase in the resources of credit constrained
households and, therefore, promote educational attainment.

in all of our models. These variables are likely to be highly correlated with college
quality. We use these variables to account for any correlation between our measure
of tuition (which corresponds only to four-year public colleges) and college quality.
In order to examine the sensitivity of our estimates to the choice of instruments, we
estimate models with and without tuition.

Included among X and Z in the linear-in-parameter representations are linear and
quadratic terms in AFQT, mother's education, number of siblings, permanent local

earnings, and permanent local unemployment, as well as a dummy variable indicat
ing urban residence at age 14 and cohort dummies. The four exclusion restrictions
or instruments enter ns(Z) but not the outcome equations /i,(X) or /i0(X). They are
interacted with AFQT, maternal education, and number of siblings.14 In addition,
three variables are included in the outcome equations but not the selection equation:
years of experience in 1991 (and its square), earnings in the county of residence in
1991, and unemployment in the state of residence in 1991. Given that these vari
ables are realized only in 1991 and that we condition on earlier values of these vari
ables, it is natural to assume the residualized variables do not enter the individuals'
information sets at the time individuals make their college decision, which for most
of them takes place more than 12 years earlier.15

Table 3 presents estimates of the parameters of a logit model for schooling choice.
We provide estimates of the average marginal derivatives of each variable in the choice

model (the coefficients are in Table A-4 in the online Appendix). The instruments are

(jointly) strong predictors of schooling, as are mother's education, AFQT, number of
siblings, and permanent local earnings in the county of residence at age 17.

The tests for selection on returns ((3 correlated with S in equation (1), also known

as selection on gains), developed and applied in Heckman, Schmierer, and Urzua
(2010), test whether the MTE is constant in us (/3 uncorrected with S), or whether
it varies with us (J3 correlated with 5). Given equations (5) and (6), a simple test of
selection on gains consists of estimating equation (9), specifying K(P) to be a poly
nomial in P (P is estimated using a logit), and testing whether the coefficients on the
polynomial terms of order higher than one are jointly equal to zero.
The results of this test are presented in Table 4, panel A. In each column of the table

we specify a polynomial in P of orders 2 through 5. For each specification (i.e., each
model defined by the highest order of the polynomial in P) we present the ^-values
of joint tests that the coefficients on the terms of order higher than one in each poly

nomial are equal to zero (rejection would indicate that K(P) is a nonlinear function of
P). We account for the fact that we test multiple hypotheses simultaneously (Joseph P.

Romano and Michael Wolf 2005) by constructing an adjusted critical value, following

14The total sample size is 1,747 (882 with S = 0 and 865 with S = 1). Table A-3 in the online Appendix docu
ments that individuals who attend college have, on average, a 34 percent higher wage than those who do not attend

college. They also have 3.25 fewer years of work experience since they spend more time in school (on average,
they have four additional years of completed schooling). The scores on a measure of cognitive ability, the AFQT,
are much higher for individuals who attend college than they are for those who do not. Those who attend only high
school have less educated mothers, come from larger families, and are less likely to have grown up in an urban
area and in an area with a public four-year college than individuals who attend college. They face higher tuition
in the areas where they grew up. Local labor market variables are not much different between these two groups of
individuals, independently of the time of measurement.
15 Below we also present results where instruments are not interacted with X, and where these experience and
local labor market conditions in 1991 are not excluded from the selection equation. The results are very similar to
the ones we obtain in our main specification, although with larger standard errors in the first case.

Notes: This table reports the coefficients and average marginal derivatives from a logit regres

sion of college attendance (a dummy variable that is equal to one if an individual has ever
attended college and equal to zero if he has never attended college but has graduated from high
school) on polynomials in the set of variables listed in the table and on cohort dummies (not
reported). For each individual, we compute the effect of increasing each variable by one unit
(keeping all the others constant) on the probability of enrolling in college, and then we average
across all individuals. Bootstrapped standard errors (in parentheses) are presented below the
corresponding parameters (250 replications). At the bottom of the table we present p-values for
the test of joint significance of coefficients on the instruments. Corrected AFQT corresponds
to a standardized measure of the Armed Forces Qualifying Test score corrected for the fact
that different individuals have different amounts of schooling at the time they take the test (see

Hansen, Heckman, and Mullen 2004; see also the online Appendix). This variable is standard
ized within the NLSY sample to have mean 0 and variance 1. Local earnings and unemploy
ment rates are averages across all individuals in the population residing in a given area (county
for log earnings, state for unemployment), independent of age, gender, race, and skill level. For
each location, "Permanent" local earnings and unemployment take the average of each variable
between 1979 and 2000 (and then assign it to the location of residence at 17).

fact that P is estimated by using standard corrections to asymptotic standard errors (in
Table A-5 of the online Appendix, we present alternative results where this correction

is done using the bootstrap). Using this test, we reject that the MTE is constant in us

aThe size of the test is controlled using a critical value constructed by the bootstrap method of Romano and Wolf
(2005) using a 10 percent significance level.
bIn order to compute the numbers in this table, we construct groups of values of Us and average the MTE within

these groups, by computing E(Yt — K0|X = x, Us' < Us < U"'), where Us' and U"J are the lowest and highest
values of Us defined for interval j. Then we compare the average MTE across adjacent groups and test whether the
difference is equal to zero using the bootstrap with 250 replications.

B. Estimating the MTE and Marginal Policy Effects

Using a Normal Selection Model
The traditional approach to estimating the model of equations (2) and (3) specifies
a parametric joint distribution for (U0, Uu V), usually that (£/0, Ux, V) are jointly nor

mally distributed and independent of (X,Z), and estimates the outcome and choice
equations together using the method of maximum likelihood (e.g., Bjorklund and
Moffitt 1987). Although our primary empirical results are from a semiparametric
method, the results based on a parametric normal model are a useful benchmark
against which to compare our estimates from less functional form dependent estima
tors. The parametric specification is less flexible than our semiparametric specifica
tion, but the resulting estimates are much more precise.
Maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters 50, $i, 7 and their standard errors

are presented in Table A-6 in the online Appendix. The MTE for this model is equa
tion (10). A simple test of whether the slope of the MTE is zero (i.e., individuals do
not select into college based on variability in 0) is a test of whether a lv — aov — 0.
We estimate that aw — anv = —0.2388 with a standard error of 0.0982, so we reject

this hypothesis (p-value = 0.0150). This supports the conclusions in Table 4 that do
not impose the joint normality assumption.
Figure 1 plots the estimated MTE with 90 percent confidence bands, evaluated at
mean values of X (we obtain annualized estimates of the returns to college by divid
ing the MTE by four, which is the average difference in years of schooling for those

with S = 1 and those with S = 0). The MTE is declining and precisely estimated.
The people with the highest gross returns are more likely to go to college (have low

Figure 1. MTE Estimated from a Normal Selection Model

Notes: To estimate the function plotted here, we estimate a parametric normal selection model by maximum likeli
hood. The figure is computed using the following formula:

Amte(x,m5) = /!,(*) - rt,(x) - (aiv - aov)$>~'(us),
where <rlv and aov are the covariances between the unobservables of the college and high school equation and the
unobservable in the selection equation; and X includes experience, current average earnings in the county of resi
dence, current average unemployment in the state of residence, AFQT, mother's education, number of siblings,
urban residence at 14, permanent local earnings in the county of residence at 17, permanent unemployment in the
state of residence at 17, and cohort dummies. We plot 90 percent confidence bands.

Us). Individuals choose the schooling sector in which they have comparative advan
tage. The magnitude of the heterogeneity in returns on which agents select is sub
stantial: returns can vary from —15.6 percent (for high Us persons, who would lose
from attending college) to 28.8 percent per year of college (for low Us persons).16
The magnitude of total heterogeneity is likely to be even higher since the MTE is
the average gain at that quantile of desire to attend college. In general, there will be
a distribution of returns centered at each value of the MTE. Furthermore, once we
account for variation in X and its impact on returns through X(<5, — <50), we observe

returns as low as —31.56 percent and as high as 51.02 percent.

Using the weights presented in online Appendix Table A-IB, we can construct
the standard treatment parameters from the MTE. We present the results in the
first column of Table 5 (standard errors are bootstrapped). These include marginal
returns to the three different policies considered in Table 1 (MPRTE), which are all

MTE(x, 1) = —00. In order to get finite values at the extremes of the normal MTE, we restrict the support of Us to
be between 0.0001 and 0.9999.

treatment on the untreated (TUT), and different versions of the marginal policy relevant treat
ment effect (MPRTE). The linear IV estimate uses P as the instrument. Standard errors are

below the return to the average student (TT = E(B\ S = 1)), the average person
(ATE = E(j3)), and the IV estimate. But it is not clear if these estimates are reliable,
given the strong normality assumption used to generate them. We next corroborate
these estimates of marginal returns using a more robust semiparametric approach.

C. Estimating the MTE and Marginal Policy Effects
Using Local Instrumental Variables

An alternative and more robust approach for estimating the MTE estimates
E(Y\X,P(Z) = p) semiparametrically and then computes its derivative with respect
to p, as shown in the analysis of equations (5) and (6). If all we are willing to assume
is that (U0,UhV) is independent of Z given X, then it is only possible to estimate the
MTE over the support of P conditional on X. Figure 2 plots/(P| X), the density of P
given X (P is estimated by a logit). Since X is multidimensional, we use an index of
X (X[5, — <50]). It is striking how small the support of P is for each value of the X
index. It is not possible to estimate MTE over the full unit interval, and as a conse
quence, it is not possible to estimate conventional treatment parameters such as the
average treatment effect (E(j3)) or the effect of treatment on the treated (E(/3\S =1)).

It is still possible, however, to estimate MPRTE, since this parameter only puts posi
tive weight over sections of the MTE that are identified within the support of f(P | X).

Empirically, it is very difficult to apply the procedure described in Section I while
conditioning on X nonparametrically. We first proceed by invoking the stronger
assumption that (X,Z) is independent of (U0, Uh Us). We relax it below. Under this

Figure 2. Support of P Conditional on X

Notes: P is the estimated probability of going to college. It is estimated from a logit regression of college atten
dance on corrected AFQT, mother's education, number of siblings, urban residence at 14, permanent earnings in the
county of residence at 17, permanent unemployment in the state of residence at 17, cohort dummies, a dummy vari
able indicating the presence of a college in the county of residence at age 14, average log earnings in the county of
residence at age 17, and average state unemployment in the state of residence at age 17 (see Table 3). X corresponds
to an index of variables in the outcome equation.

assumption, MTE is identified over the marginal support of P(Z), and thus it is only
necessary to investigate the marginal support of P(Z) as opposed to the support of
P(Z) given X. The support of the estimated P(Z) is shown in Figure 3, and it is almost

the full unit interval. We trim observations for which the estimated P(Z) is below
0.0324 or above 0.9775, which are the minimum and maximum values of P for which
we have common support.17

The parameters of equation (9) can be estimated by a partially linear regression
of Y on X and P(Z). We proceed in two steps. The first step is construction of the
estimated P(Z), and the second step is estimation of <5, and S0 using the estimated
P(Z). The first step is carried out using a logit regression of S on Z. Our specifica
tion is quite flexible, and alternative functional form specifications for the choice
model (e.g., probit) produce results similar to the ones reported here. In the second
step we use the Peter M. Robinson (1988) method for estimating partially linear
models as extended in Heckman, Hidehiko Ichimura, and Todd (1997).18 Estimates
of S | and <50 are presented in online Appendix Table A-7.

17We define common support as the intersection of the support of P(Z) given D — 1 and the support of P(Z)
given D = 0. Restricting our empirical estimates to the common support leads us to delete 67 observations, cor
responding to 4.35 percent of the sample.
18 We run kernel regressions of each of the regressors on P using a bandwidth of 0.05. We compute the residuals
of each of these regressions and then run a linear regression of Y on these residuals. Our results are robust to choices
of bandwidth between 0.01 and 0.2.

Figure 3. Support of P for 5 = 0 and s = 1

Notes: P is the estimated probability of going to college. It is estimated from a logit regression of college atten
dance on corrected AFQT, mother's education, number of siblings, urban residence at 14, permanent earnings in the
county of residence at 17, permanent unemployment in the state of residence at 17, cohort dummies, a dummy vari
able indicating the presence of a college in the county of residence at age 14, average log earnings in the county of
residence at age 17, and average state unemployment in the state of residence at age 17 (see Table 3).

Next, consider estimation of K(P(Z)). Equation (9) implies that

E(Y - XS0 - P(Z)X[S1 - 60}\P(Z)) = K(P(Z)).
We thus use local polynomial regression of Y — X<50 — P(Z)X[<5, — <50] on P(Z) to
estimate K(P(Z)) and its partial derivative with respect to P(Z). Local polynomial
estimation not only provides a unified framework for estimating both a function and
its derivative but also has a variety of desirable properties in comparison with other
available nonparametric methods.19
Figure 4 plots the component of the MTE that depends on Us, with 90 percent
confidence bands computed from the bootstrap.20 We fix the components of X at their

19Jianqing Fan and Irene Gijbels (1996) provide a detailed discussion of the properties of local polynomial
estimators. In general, use of higher-order polynomials may reduce the bias but increase the variance by introduc
ing more parameters. Fan and Gijbels suggest that the order n of the polynomial be equal to it = t + 1, where r is
the order of the derivative of the function of interest that we want to fit. That is, Fan and Gijbels recommend a local

linear estimator for fitting a function and a local quadratic estimator for fitting a first-order derivative. Therefore,

we use a local quadratic estimator of dK(p)/dp. We choose the bandwidth that minimizes the residual square cri
terion proposed in Fan and Gijbels, which gives us a bandwidth of 0.322. Our results are robust to the choice of

bandwidths between 0.1 and 0.4.

20Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd (1997) show that the bootstrap provides a better approximation to the true
standard errors than asymptotic standard errors for the estimation of /?,, /?0, and K(P) in a model similar to the one
we present here. We use 250 bootstrap replications. Throughout the paper, in each iteration of the bootstrap we re
estimate P(Z) so all standard errors account for the fact that P(Z) is itself an estimated object.

Locally Quadratic Regression Estimates
Notes'. To estimate the function plotted here, we first use a partially linear regression of log wages on polynomials
in X, interactions of polynomials in X and P, and K(P), a locally quadratic function of P (where P is the predicted
probability of attending college), with a bandwidth of 0.32; X includes experience, current average earnings in the
county of residence, current average unemployment in the state of residence, AFQT, mother's education, number of
siblings, urban residence at 14, permanent local earnings in the county of residence at 17, permanent unemployment
in the state of residence at 17, and cohort dummies. The figure is generated by evaluating by the derivative of (9)
at the average value of X. Ninety percent standard error bands are obtained using the bootstrap (250 replications).

mean values in the sample. As above, we annualize the MTE. Our estimates show
that, in agreement with the normal model, E(UX — U0\US = us) is declining in us, i.e.,
students with high values of Us have lower returns than those with low values of Us.

Even though the semiparametric estimate of the MTE has larger standard errors
than the estimate based on the normal model, we still reject the hypothesis that its
slope is zero. We have already discussed the rejection of the hypothesis that MTE is
constant in us, based on the test results reported in Table 4, panel A. But we can also
directly test whether the semiparametric MTE is constant in us or not. We evaluate

the MTE at 26 points, equally spaced between 0 and 1 (with intervals of 0.04). We
construct pairs of nonoverlapping adjacent intervals (0-0.04, 0.08-0.12, 0.16-0.20,

0.24-0.28,...), and we take the mean of the MTE for each pair. These are LATEs
defined over different sections of the MTE. We compare adjacent LATEs. Table 4,
panel B, reports the outcome of these comparisons. For example, the first column
reports that

E(YX - K0|X = < Us < 0.04)
- E(YX - F0|X = x,0.08 < Us < 0.12) = 0.0689.

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

OCTOBER 2011

The p-value of the test of the hypothesis that this difference is equal to zero is
reported below this number and is 0.0240, which implies that we reject this hypoth

esis at conventional levels of significance.21 This table shows that the slope of the
MTE is negative and statistically significant (at a 10 percent level of significance)
for values of Us up to 0.76 (p-values are reported in the bottom row of the table), and

it remains negative but statistically insignificant after that. This is further evidence

that individuals select into college based on heterogeneous returns in realized out
comes, although the rejection is only strong in the left tail of the estimated MTEs.22

A joint test that the difference across all adjacent LATEs is different from zero has

a /?-value of 0.0520.

P only has support between 0.0324 and 0.9775, and thus it is not possible to
estimate parameters that require full support, such as E(0), E(3\S = 1) and
E(j3\S = 0). Estimation of such parameters is possible in the normal model only
because of its parametric assumptions. Analysts often define such parameters as the
objects of interest, even though they are very hard to identify,23 and even though they

are often not economically interesting.

In contrast, the MPRTE parameter not only answers interesting economic ques
tions about the marginal gains of specific policies, but it is also identified without
strong support assumptions, since it only requires estimating the MTE within the

support of the data (see Carneiro, Heckman, and Vytlacil 2010). The second col
umn of Table 5 presents estimates of three different versions of the MPRTE, where

the policy considered is either a marginal change in tuition or a marginal change
in P. The estimates are obtained in the following way. First we construct differ
ent weighted averages of the MTE by applying the weights presented in Table 1.
Recall, however, that these weights are defined conditional on X and they define
parameters conditional on X. Therefore, after computing each of these parameters
for each value of X = x, we need to integrate them against the appropriate distribu
tion of X.24

21 Given that we bootstrap the nonparametric MTE, we implement the following test. For each pair of adja
cent LATEs, the null is that the two LATEs are equal, and the alternative is that they are different. We construct

250 bootstrap replications of the MTE, evaluated at mean values of X. The MTEs are evaluated on 26 equally

spaced points on a grid (between 0 and 1). Let LATE' — LATE'+' be the difference between two adjacent
LATEs (j and /+1), and let LATE'b-LATE'bl be b'h bootstrap replication of this difference. Then we compute
the following statistics: T = | LATE' — LATE'+t | (the absolute value of the difference between two adjacent

LATEs) and Tb = | (LATE'b - LATEtf1) — {LATE' — LATE'+I) | (the recentered absolute value of the dif
ference between two adjacent LATEs). The p-value of the test is the proportion of bootstrap replications for

which Tb > T. A p-value for a joint test is also possible by constructing C = Y,j=l (LATE' — LATE'+l)2 and

Cb = Ej'l [(LATE'b - LATE'b') - (LATE1 - LATE'+')}2, where J is the number of LATEs taken (12 in our
case). The p-value of the test is the proportion of bootstrap replications for which Cb > C.
22This and the other tests assume the validity of the instruments. If the instruments are not valid, these test results
could be a consequence of the invalidity of the instruments.

23One alternative is to construct bounds, following Heckman and Vytlacil (2000). For example, applying the
Heckman and Vytlacil bounds to our data, the estimated lower bound on ATE is 0.0411, and the estimated upper
bound is 0.1043 (assuming a minimum value for the hourly wage of $1 and a maximum value of $100). We have
also computed approximations to E(f3), E(/3\S = 1), and E(0\S = 0), where we rescale the weights in Table 1 to
integrate to one over the region [0.0324; 0.9775]. These estimates are respectively (bootstrapped standard errors in

parenthesis): 0.0815 (0.0454), 0.2420 (0.0713), and -0.0662 (0.0819).

24Since X is a high dimensional vector, it is not computationally feasible to condition on it. Therefore, as an
approximation, we condition instead on an index of X: X(<5, — <50). A better approach would be to estimate the
index using, for example, semiparametric least squares (SLS; see Ichimura 1993), exploiting the fact that/(P] X)

= f(P\X6)=>E(P\X) = E(P\X6). Since this procedure is computationally very intensive, it is not feasible to

Note: The scale of the j-axis is the scale of the MTE, not the scale of the weights, which are scaled to fit the picture.

It is informative to visualize the weights underlying each parameter, which show

us why some parameter values are higher or lower than others. Figure 5 graphs the
weights on E(YX — K01 X,(/5 = us) for the three MPRTE parameters with estimates

reported in Table 5, all evaluated at the mean of X. While the MPRTE weights for

the first two policies (Z* = Zk + a and Pa = P + a) weight mainly the middle
section of the MTE, the third policy (Pa = (1 + a)P) overweights individuals with
high levels of Us because its effect on enrollment is larger for those with already
high levels of P.25

The IV estimate, presented in the second to the last row of Table 5, is 0.0951.
We use P(Z) as the instrument, but it is possible to construct IV estimates for other

combinations of instruments (see Table A-8 in the online Appendix). IV does not
correspond to any of the MPRTE parameters that we consider, and it is particularly
far from MPRTE in the case of the third policy. Figure A-1 in the online Appendix
shows the sharp difference in the MTE weights for IV/LATE and the third of the
MPRTE parameters, evaluated at mean X.

Notice that both MPRTE and LATE correspond to some marginal effect (see
Imbens 2010, for arguments for using LATE). However, LATE only estimates the
policy effect of interest if the instrument variation corresponds exactly to the policy

compute standard errors from it. We show below that the point estimates we obtain when estimating this index by
SLS are very similar to the ones we get with the index we use.

25Throughout the paper, we refer to the MPRTE of the policy Z* = Zk + a as a shorthand for the limit as

a —» 0 of the PRTE parameters defined by Z' = Z1' + a, and likewise with the MPRTE for Pa = P + a and

Pa = (1 + a)P.

variation. For a specific policy of interest, LATE can be wildly off the mark. Figure 6

plots the IV weights (using P as the instrument) together with the MPRTE weights

for the marginal policy defined by Pa — (1 + a) P. These two weights are dramati
cally different from each other.26

One benefit of our approach over the LATE approach is that it enables us to deter
mine what portion of the MTE each instrument in Z\X identifies, i.e., it enables
analysts to identify the quantiles of Us that each instrument traces out. Thus, in our
approach, the margin traced out by variation in each instrument is clearly identified.

In the LATE approach that does not specify an explicit choice equation, the margin
identified by variation in an instrument is not clearly defined.

Figure 7 shows the support of P(Z) when we fix the variables in X at two different
values and vary the instruments one at a time. This is the approach required to secure

estimates if we condition on X and do not invoke independence between X and (U0,
UbV). This exercise informs us about what margin each instrument identifies under
more general conditions. It also shows how far we expand the support of P(Z) (and,
therefore, the support of Us over which we can estimate the MTE) by using multiple
instruments simultaneously, as opposed to using them one at a time.
There are two curves in the picture corresponding to the MTE evaluated at differ
ent values of X. The two lines correspond to the twenty-fifth (bottom) and seventy
fifth (top) percentiles of the distribution of X(<5x — S0). The curves have dashed and

26 In fact, the IV estimate is a much better approximation to either of the other two MPRTE parameters, although

the differences are still substantial (but not statistically significant). The approximation implicit in the estimates
depends on the weights graphed in Figure A-l in the online Appendix.

Figure 7. Support of P for Fixed X

Notes: This figures shows the support of P and the corresponding identified portion of the MTE when we fix the
variables in X at a given value. We start by computing the average X for values of X(6, — 60) at the twenty-fifth and
seventy-fifth percentile of its distribution. The twocurvesin the figure represent the MTE evaluated at these two valuesof

X0, — <50), with the solid component corresponding to the portion of the MTE that is identified if we do not assume
independence between X and (U0, Uh V). In order to draw the line labeled "Distance," we not only fix X at the two
values referred to above, but we also fix all the other instruments at the corresponding mean values. The line labeled
"Wage" corresponds to the support of P( Z) we obtain when all variables except local wage at 17 are kept at their

mean values (conditional on a given percentile of X(<5, — <50)), the line labeled "Unemp." is generated by vary
ing only local unemployment at 17, and the line labeled "Tuition" is generated by varying only local tuition at 17.
Finally, the line labeled "All" is the support of P( Z) when all the instruments are allowed to vary and the variables
in X are fixed.

solid segments. The solid segment represents the portion of the MTE we can identify

at each value of X if we do not invoke independence between X and (U0,Ui,V).
To be precise, we find values of X for which X(<5, — 50) is at the twenty-fifth percen

tile of its distribution (we pick values of this index between the twenty-fourth and
twenty-sixth percentile of its distribution and compute mean X in this interval). Then,
we vary the instruments within this range, and we trace out the corresponding support

of P for X fixed at this value. We then take our estimate of the MTE and select only
the segment contained within the support of P for fixed X. We do the same for values

of X for which X^ — 60) is at the seventy-fifth percentile of its distribution. The
dashed segments in each curve correspond to the additional portions of the MTE that

we identify if, instead, we assume independence between X and (U0,U\,V).
It is informative to know not only what section of the MTE is identified at each
value of X, but also what section of the MTE is identified by varying each instru
ment one at a time. To generate the graph labeled "Distance," we fix not only X
at the two values referred to above, but also fix all the other instruments at the

corresponding mean values for each of the two percentiles of the distribution of

X((5| — S0) that we consider. Because the distance variable takes only two values
for each X, the support of P(Z) in this case has only two points. The line labeled

"Wage" corresponds to the support of P(Z) we obtain when all variables except
local wage at 17 are kept at their mean values (conditional on a given percentile of
X(<5] — SQ)), the line labeled "Unemp." is generated by varying only local unemploy
ment at 17, and the line labeled "Tuition" is generated by varying only local tuition at

17. Finally, the line labeled "All" is the support of P(Z) when all the instruments are
allowed to vary and the variables in X are fixed. Each instrument has different sup

port, so if we were to use each instrument in isolation at mean X we would only be
able to identify a small section of the MTE. When we allow all the instruments to vary

simultaneously we get larger support for the MTE, but it is still not close to the full

unit interval. This analysis makes clear which instruments contribute to identifying
which portions of the MTE.

D. Sensitivity to Alternative Models and Specifications

In order to examine the robustness of our estimates, it is useful to examine the
sensitivity of our results to changes in specifications. The simplest way to do this is

to examine how various summary measures of returns vary across specifications. It
would be natural to present estimates of such parameters as the average treatment

effect (ATE) ( = £(/?)), the effect of treatment on the treated (TT) (= E(j3\S = 1)),
and the effect of treatment on the untreated (TUT) (— E(/3\S = 0)), which put most
of their weight in very different sections of the MTE, and therefore should be sensi
tive to changes in the estimated MTE. Unfortunately, these parameters cannot be
identified in our data, because the support of P is not quite the unit interval, even
invoking assumptions about the independence of X and the unobservables. The sup
port of P is close to the unit interval, however. We report estimates of what ATE, TT,

and TUT would be if we restricted the weights to integrate to one in the support of

the MTE ([0.0324;0.9775]). We call these parameters ATE, TT, and TUT (to distin
guish them from ATE, TT, and TUT, which are not identified). In addition to these,
we also consider (for parsimony, only) the first of the three definitions of MPRTE

(Z* = Zk + a), and the equivalent AMTE (| Z7 - V| < e), shown in Table 5.
Results are reported in Tables 6, panel A (where we focus mainly on choice of
sample and specification of the outcome equations), and Table 6, panel B (where
we focus mainly on the specification of the choice equation). Column 1 of Table 6,
panel A, presents estimates of the baseline specification, in addition to the p-values
for two simple tests of selection on returns: a test of the null that MPRTE = TT
(does the marginal student attracted into schooling by the policy change have the
same return as the average student in college?); and, for a test of the null, that there
is no selection on returns in the normal model (H0 : alv - aov = 0).

Our baseline model has the important limitation that we restrict the school
ing variable to take only two values. It is possible to extend this methodology to

multiple levels of schooling (e.g., Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil 2006, 2008;
Heckman and Vytlacil 2007b) but this requires multiple instrumental variables,
one for each schooling transition. Even though the specification we use is common
in the literature (e.g., Willis and Rosen 1979; Taber 2001; Carneiro and Heckman
2002; Moffitt 2008), it is still worthwhile to examine the robustness of our results to

simple changes in it. To start with, note that other papers in the literature have either

increase in the point estimates.

dummy for whether a person has dropped out of high school (these dummies are

assumed to be exogenous). The estimates of the return to schooling are similar to
the ones in the baseline model, although slightly higher. The main patterns remain
the same, however.
Table 6, panel B, considers changes in the specification of the decision equation.
We start by noting that in our baseline specification there are three variables that are

included in the wage equation but not in the college decision equations: years of
experience, local earnings in the county of residence in 1991, and local unemploy
ment in the county of residence in 1991. The assumption is that (conditional on all
other controls) the agent does not have information about the effect of these vari

ables on earnings at the time of the college decision that is typically made 8 to 15
years before, and therefore they would have a zero coefficient in the selection equa

tion. Alternatively, we could include these variables in the selection equation. The
results from this exercise are shown in column 1 of panel B, Table 6. The magnitude
and main pattern of the estimates resembles that of the baseline model.
Recall from Section IIA that the instruments (presence of college in area of resi
dence, local wage and unemployment rate, local tuition) enter the college decision
equation interacted with some of the control variables (AFQT, maternal education,
number of siblings). It is natural to use this specification because the effect of each
of these instruments is likely to vary across different families. Furthermore, such a
specification is helpful in achieving lower standard errors. One may worry, however,
that in such a specification what drives independent variation in college attendance
is the set of controls (entering in a nonlinear way) as opposed to the instruments,
even though we safeguard against this by having a very flexible specification of the
wage equations. In column 2 of Table 6, panel B, we estimate a specification where
none of the instruments is interacted with any other variable. The results are very
similar to our baseline results, but with larger standard errors.
Columns 3 and 4 of Table 6, panel B, explore the sensitivity of our results to the
choice of instruments. In column 3, we use only the instruments in Cameron and
Taber (2004) (the presence of a college and local wage in the area of residence in
adolescence), and in column 4 we exclude only tuition from the set of instruments
in case it is correlated with college quality, even after controlling for AFQT and
maternal education. The overall conclusion is that our main results are insensitive
to the inclusion of tuition and of the local unemployment rate in the set of instru
ments, over and above the instruments used in Cameron and Taber (2004). The null
hypothesis of no selection on returns is rejected in all of these samples, whether we
use the normality test or the test that 7T = MPRTE.27

Finally, the last column of Table 6, panel B, shows the point estimates of the
main parameters that result from using an alternative method to estimate the
index of X on which to condition when estimating the density of P conditional on

X, /(P|X). In particular, we estimate E(P | X) assuming a linear index in X and
using semiparametric least squares (SLS; see Ichimura 1993). We then use this
index instead of the full X vector (and instead of an arbitrary index) to estimate

/(P|X), which we use to construct the parameter weights of Tables 1 and the
online Appendix Table A-IB. The estimates we obtain using this method are very

27 One exception is the model with estimates reported in column 2 of Table 6, panel B.

similar to the point estimates of our baseline specification. They are computation

ally very demanding, however, and it is not feasible to produce standard errors fo
our parameters using this method.

III. Summary and Conclusions

This paper estimates marginal returns to college when returns differ among
individuals, and persons select into economic activities based in part on their idio

syncratic returns. Consistent with Heckman, Schmierer, and Urzua (2010), w

find evidence that people select into schooling on the basis of realized returns to
schooling. In general, marginal and average returns to college are not the same.28
Conventional average return parameters and IV estimators are weighted averages of
the marginal treatment effect (MTE). Unless the instruments are the policy changes
of interest, these parameters do not answer well-posed policy questions. We show
how to use the estimates from a local version of IV (LIV) to determine the marginal
policy relevant treatment effect (MPRTE).
We show how to identify and estimate the MTE using a robust semiparametric
selection model. Focusing on a policy-relevant question, we construct estimators
based on the MTE to answer it, rather than hoping that a particular instrumenta
variable estimator happens to answer a question of economic interest.
It has been written "better LATE than nothing" (Imbens 2010). We say that in

addressing policy questions, "better MPRTE than LATE." We use the MTE to iden
tify the margins that different instruments identify.

We test for the importance of self-selection on ex post gains in the labor market.

The data suggest that self-selection on gains (the correlation of (3 with S) is an
empirically important phenomenon governing schooling choices, consistent with
the analysis of Willis and Rosen (1979). Individuals sort into schooling on the basi
of gains that are observed by the economist as well as unobserved (by the econo
mist) variables. Some marginal expansions of schooling produce marginal gains that
are well below average returns. For other policies associated with other marginal

expansions, the marginal gains are substantial.
Comparing estimates from our semiparametric IV approach with estimates from
a normal selection model of the sort used by Willis and Rosen (1979) and Bjorklund

and Moffitt (1987), the semiparametric estimates produce an MTE with the same
general shape consistent with diminishing returns to education for additional stu
dents, but with larger standard errors.
