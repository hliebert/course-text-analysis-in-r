1. Introduction
In many applications of duration analysis, structural interpretations can be given to defects in
duration distributions. In studies of fecundity, defects in durations until first birth correspond to
sterility (e.g., Heckman and Walker, 1990). Defects in unemployment duration distributions are
sometimes associated with structural unemployment (e.g., Ridder and van den Berg, 1998). In the job
matching model by Jovanovic (1979), some workers and firms learn rapidly that their matches are of
exceptional value and should be cherished, and job tenure distributions are defective. In medicine,
some proportion of a population under study may not be susceptible to developing a disease (e.g.,
Hougaard et al., 1994).
An early and well-known model of defective duration distributions is the mover–stayer model by
Blumen et al. (1955). They assume that a population of job holders consists of a group of ‘stayers’,
who never leave their jobs, and a group of ‘movers’, who leave their jobs at constant rates. The
resulting job duration distribution of the population has a defect equal to the share of the stayers in the
population. In the duration-to-birth example, stayers can be identified with sterile couples, and movers

with fertile couples. However, not all fertile couples necessarily have children. This suggests an
¨ ¨
extension of the mover–stayer model with an additional group, ‘defecting movers’ (e.g., Gonul,
1989). Unlike stayers, defecting movers have typically been at risk of moving, but have eventually
ended up never moving. Such a group exists if the hazard rates of moving decrease sufficiently fast
with duration, for instance exponentially.
If mover hazards vary with regressors, the share of defecting movers typically varies with the
regressors as well, and is generally lower for groups with high hazards. For example, if socioeconomic circumstances increase the rate at which couples reproduce, they are less likely to grow old
without having at least one child. Alternatively, defects could vary with regressors through the share
of stayers (Heckman and Walker, 1987).
In this note, we discuss identification of potentially defective duration models. Even though such
models have been estimated in various special and parametric forms, non-parametric identification has
hardly been discussed in the literature. Section 2 introduces a mixed proportional hazard (MPH)
duration model with stayers and defective movers. We first assume that the share of stayers is
independent of the regressors, and show that we only need data for two samples corresponding to two
values of the regressors for identification. Existing identification proofs for the two-sample case
routinely assume defectiveness away (Elbers and Ridder, 1982; Kortram et al., 1995). Section 3
qualifies this result by discussing models in which the share of stayers depends on the regressors.

2. An identification theorem
Consider the following MPH model for a random variable T $ 0 conditional on a k 3 1-vector of
regressors X (e.g., Lancaster, 1979):

E

Pr(T . tuX) 5 + (z(t)f (X)): 5 e 2z(t ) f (X )v dG(v),

(1)

with f :- , R k → (0, `), z:[0, `) → [0, `) continuously differentiable with z9 . 0 and z(0) 5 0, G the
distribution of some nonnegative random variable V independent of X, and + its Laplace transform.1
Eq. (1) is a mixture of the distribution of T u(X, V ) over the distribution G of V. The hazard rate
corresponding to the distribution of T u(X, V ) is z9(t)f (X)V, which explains the name ‘mixed
proportional hazard’.
Suppose that X assumes only two values, say x 1 and x 2 . Denote the corresponding survival
functions by F¯ 1 (t): 5 Pr(T . tuX 5 x 1 ) and F¯ 2 (t): 5 Pr(T . tuX 5 x 2 ), and the cumulative distribution
functions by F1 : 5 1 2 F¯ 1 and F2 : 5 1 2 F¯ 2 . We have that lim t →` F¯ i (t) 5 lim t→` + (f (x i )z(t)) . 0 if
either lim t→` z(t) , ` or lim z→` + (z) 5 Pr(V 5 0) . 0, or both. Obviously, Pr(V 5 0) is the share of
stayers. Lim t →` F¯ i (t) includes both stayers and defecting movers, and is smallest for that i such that
f (x i ) is largest. We have the following non-parametric identification result.
Proposition 1. If E[V ] 5 1, f (x 1 ) 5 1, and c: 5 f (x 2 ) ± 1, there corresponds a unique triple (z, c, + )
to each pair (F¯ 1 , ¯F2 ) consistent with Eq. (1).
1

The assumptions that z is continuously differentiable and that z9 . 0 are made for expositional convenience only, and can
be relaxed. Also, we could allow for ‘observed’ stayers, i.e. f (x) 5 0 for some x, but this would be trivial.

The conditions in the Proposition are standard in the MPH literature (e.g., Elbers and Ridder, 1982).
The normalizations are innocuous, apart from requiring that E[V ] , `. Unlike Kortram et al. (1995),
we have to keep track of the intervals on which + 21 and + are identified, and exploit the real
analyticity of + to extend identification to [0, `).
The result can be partially extended to censored data by applying the identification theorem for
21
interval-censored data provided by Kortram et al. (1995). They exploit the analyticity of F¯ 1 + F¯ 2 to
identify + from interval-censored data, again routinely assuming defectiveness away. We could
extend our result along these lines and identify the share of stayers from interval-censored data.
However, with right-censoring, and therefore interval-censoring, the share of defecting movers is not
identified.

3. Some extensions and qualifications
The result in Section 2 breaks down if we extend the model by allowing the share of stayers to
depend on the regressors. To investigate this case, denote the share of stayers for a given vector of
regressors x by q:x [ - ∞Pr(V 5 0uX 5 x) [ [0, 1). Assume that the unobservable V is independent of
X among movers, i.e. V *Xu(V . 0). Now, even though V will in general depend on X unconditionally,
the specific structure of this dependence facilitates identification. We give two conditions that ensure
identification by somehow identifying non-defecting movers.
First, we could assume that none of the movers defect, i.e. that lim t→` z(t) 5 `, which gives a
model similar to that in Heckman and Walker (1987). Then, for each x [ -, the share of stayers q(x)
is immediately identified as the defect in the observed conditional duration distribution. This can be
used to correct our data and model for defects, as in

1 2 q(x)
where +˜ is the Laplace transform of the distribution of V u(V . 0). As +˜ is independent of x by
assumption, the results in e.g. Kortram et al. (1995), or just Proposition 1, can be applied to prove
identification of the corrected model in the two-sample case.
Alternatively, we could assume that the regressors can be varied to single out a limiting group of
non-defecting movers, without varying the share of stayers. More formally, suppose that - 5 -0 3

- q , with -0 , R l and - q , R k2l , and that q((x 0 , x q )) 5 q(x
q̃ :- q → [0, 1). In other words, the first l regressors are excluded from the share of stayers, but may
affect the mover hazards. Furthermore, for any given x q [ - q , a sequence hn [ -0 exists such that
lim n →` f ((hn , x q )) 5 `. This ‘large support’ assumption ensures that a limiting group of non-defecting
movers exists within each group characterized by the last k 2 l regressors. Then, for each x q [ - q , we
˜ q ) as the defect in the conditional duration distribution for this limiting group. The
can identify q(x
model of Section 2 can be considered a special case where all regressors are excluded from q. It
should be noted that the large support assumption of Heckman and Singer (1984), requiring f to
assume all values in (0, `), trivially yields identification in this model, as in our second case above.
However, Proposition 1 shows that we do not need such a large support assumption in this special
case, but only data for two samples corresponding to different values of the regressor effect f.
