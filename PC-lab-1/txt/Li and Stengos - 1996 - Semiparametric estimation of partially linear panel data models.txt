Abstract
In this paper we consider estimating a general partially linear semiparametric panel
data model, where we allow for some of the regressors to be correlated with the errors.
We assume the usual empirical case of N large and T small and as in Robinson (1988) the
proposed instrumental variable estimator is shown to be &-consistent.

1. Introduction
Economic research has been enriched by the availability
of panel data that
measure individual
cross-sectional
behaviour over time. Hsiao (1986) reviews
the literature of estimation
and inference in parametric panel data models. In
this paper, we adopt a semiparametric
approach to modelling a general partially
linear panel data model. We allow some of the regressors to be correlated with
the error term. We propose to estimate the model by instrumental
variable
(IV) estimation
by adapting Robinson’s
(1988) framework. The proposed IV
estimator

is shown

2. The model

We consider the following semiparametric panel data model:
Yit= XitP+ e(zit) + 42,

i= l,...,

N,

t=l,...,

T,

(I)

where xit and zil are of dimension p and q respectively, /I is a p x 1 unknown
parameter vector, and the functional form of 0(.) is unknown to the researcher.
Some or all the components of xit may be correlated with the error nit. We
consider the common empirical case of N large and T small. In order to get
a fi-consistent
estimator of /I,’ we have, as in Robinson (1988), to eliminate
the unknown functional 0(.). Taking conditional expectation of (1) yields
E(~itIZit)= E(xit Izit)P + @(zit).

(2)

Subtracting (2) from (1) yields
yi* = XitP + Uit,

(3)

where Yi, = yit - E(yi,l zit) and Xi* = xit - E(xitIzi,). We assume that there
exists an instrumental variable (IV) wit E RP, such that E(ai,l wit) = 0 [see assumption (A3) for details]. Hence we can estimate p by an IV method:
p^= (WX-‘ W’Y

= p + (W’X))’ W’u,

(4)

where Wi, = Wit - E(witlzi,). The IV estimator in (4) is consistent because
E(ui,l Wit) = 0. The IV estimator of /J is infeasible, however, because E(yitlzit),
E(xir)zit), and E(Witlzi,) are unknown. These conditional expectations can be
consistently estimated using some nonparametric method. In this paper we will
use the kernel method. In order to avoid the random denominator problem in
the nonparametric kernel estimation, we choose to estimate a density-weighted
relationship (see Powell et al., 1989). Hence we will estimatef(z& E(yitIzit)f(zi,),
E(xi,Izit)f(z& and E(witlzit)f(zir) by (lINTa’)GCsKit,js and (l/NTa’) X
zCsAjsKit,jstAjs = Yj.9 or Xjs, or Wj,), where Ki,,js = K((z, - zjs)/a) is the
kernel function and a is the smoothing parameter. We use the product kernel
uf is the Ith component
of o.

Premultiplying each term in (1) by the linear operator Bj, = (l/NTaq) x

(6)

where Ai<= A,j‘i,. Subtracting (5) from (6) yields, in vector form,
y”-j=(I-x)p+(B-8)+u”-u.

(7)

Then we can estimate /I by a feasible IV method:
fl=[(G$(Gx)1-‘[(a-W)‘(j-J)]
=p+[(~-q(~-x)]-1(G-KJw)I[(B-8)+u”-ti].

(8)

We can use fi to form ‘estimators’ of B(zi,) = B(zit)x,. We can estimate pi, by
jit - flXi*,and the estimated density-weighted-residual can be obtained from (6)
by replacing B(zit)by its estimator, i.e., Gi, = y”it- jit - pl(x”it- Xit).
The following assumptions are needed for the fi-consistency
of our estimator. For the definitions of the class of kernel of XI and a class of functions of
S”,, c( > 0, p > 0, see Robinson (1988).

Assumption (A3) includes the well-known one-way error component model
Uir= /Li+ vit as a special case, where pi is i.i.d. (0, cr:), Vitis i.i.d (0, a:), pi and
vit are both uncorrelated with Xit (see Hsiao, 1986). (A3) also allows for a more
general error structure than the standard one-way error component model,

correlated with the error ait, again provided that (A2) holds. See case (ii-b) below
for an example of Xi, being correlated with Uit. (A2) rules out the fixed effects
model, since in that case pi is correlated with all the regressors in the model. We
will discuss the fixed effects model at the end of this section. In assumptions (Al)
and (A4), we take v( 3 1) to be an integer, since this simplifies the notations and
allows an easy understanding of the assumptions. For example, the relationship
between the order of kernel v and q (the dimension of z) is now apparent. From
(A4), we know that 2v > q, or 2v 2 q + 1 (because v is an integer), which in
turn is equivalent to v B (q + 1)/2 (Robinson, 1988, p. 939). Hence a standard
second-order kernel (v = 2) can be used if q d 3. It is well-known that for pointwise consistency of the nonparametric kernel estimators one only needs a -+ 0
and Nag -+ co as N + co. The stronger assumption (A4) is needed here to establish the fi-consistency
of fl; see the argument in the proof of Proposition 3.
Theorem 1. Under the assumptions (AZHAI), we have

respectively.

The proof of Theorem 1 is given in the Appendix. Below we discuss some
special cases of Theorem 1 and give specific examples of an IV Witthat satisfies
assumption (A3). Let z (l) denote the first column vector of z and zt2) denote the
remaining q - 1 columns of z; x(i) and xc2) are similarly defined.
Case (i): E(ui,(xi,) = 0 (i.e., xit is exogenous). In this case one should choose
wit = xit and assumption (A3) is trivially satisfied. Note that, since we do not
assume that E(Ui,(zi,) = 0 for s # t (recall that E(uitlzit) = 0 is always guaranteed
by orthogonal decomposition), we can allow a lagged dependent variable, say
Y,,~_ 1 = zi:‘. Hence yi, = xita + e(y,,,_ i, zi?) is included as a special case in (i).3
This will enable us to obtain ,/&-consistent estimators for the coefficient of the
exogenous variable xit even if the model includes a lagged dependent variable
and other variables with an unknown functional form, and the errors can have
serial correlation and conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form.

and Li (1994).

Case (ii): Xit = yi,t_ 1. Two different situations may arise: (a) Uit is serially
uncorrelated. In this case one should choose wit = yi,t_ 1.4 (b) Uirexhibits serial
correlation; this is the case considered by Li and Stengos (1992).’ We need to
assume that there exists at least one predetermined variable, say z$’ E zit such
that E(U,lzl,‘~-1) = 0.6 Then one can choose wit = g(z$_ 1), where the g(.)
function is chosen by the researcher, and it must satisfy the condition that
cov(g(zi:) ), d(zi,)) # 0 [assumption (A3)]. For details, see Li and Stengos (1992).
Case (iii): More generally, we can have xl:’ = yi,t_ 1 and E(ui,IXi:‘) = 0
(say xi:’ is strictly exogenous). The model is yit = lyi,t_ 1 + Xit~ + e(zit) + Uir.
One can choose Wit= (yi,,- 1, xi;‘) if Uit is serially uncorrelated,
and
Wit= (m(x{y/- 1), xi:‘) otherwise, where m(.): RP-’ + R is chosen by the researcher ~ a simple choice could be m(xjFi_ 1) = x!:/?~, where x(2),’ denotes the
Ith column of xc2) (1 < I d p - 1).
There are obviously other situations that can be included as special cases of
our Theorem 1, but the above three cases seem to be the most commonly
encountered in practice.
Now we briefly discuss how to estimate b in a fixed effects model. The model is
the same as (1) except that Uir= cli + vit with pi being the fixed effects. We can
take first differences to eliminate the fixed effects, to obtain

where Yit, Xit, Ui, are the first differences variables and O(za zi,t_ I) =
d(zi,) - 8(zi,,_ 1). Eq. (9) is basically the same as (1) except that we know that
U, has at least a MA(l) structure, which only rules out the corresponding case
(ii-a). For the corresponding case (ii-b), we need to assume that ~1:’ is an
exogenous variable with respect to the remainder error Vit. Hence one can
obtain a a-consistent
estimate of fl (for a fixed effects model) by a similar IV
method discussed above.

simulations to study the finite sample behavior of the proposed semiparametric
IV estimator. The study suggests that the proposed estimator performs satisfactorily for samples of moderate size (N = 50,100 and T = 3). The results are not
reported here to save space, and they are available from the authors upon
request. The proposed semiparametric IV estimator should be useful for panel
data practioners especially when the researcher is unsure about the functional
form of part of the regression function.

Appendix

As in Robinson (1988), we introduce the following notation. For scalar or
column vector sequences Ai and Bi, define SAJB~= (l/NT)CiCrA:rJlitBit~~, and
S,d are similarly defined. Also SA3= S~3~3.Then from (8) we have

Define <it = E(witlZit), Uit= Wit- <it, [it = E(xi,lzit), and qit = xit - ii,. Then it
is obvious that in order to prove part (i) of Theorem 1, it suffices to show the
following:
