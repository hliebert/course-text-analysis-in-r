Abstract
The magnitude of the interaction effect in nonlinear models does not equal the marginal effect of the
interaction term, can be of opposite sign, and its statistical significance is not calculated by standard software.
We present the correct way to estimate the magnitude and standard errors of the interaction effect in nonlinear
models.

1. Introduction
Applied economists often estimate interaction terms to infer how the effect of one independent
variable on the dependent variable depends on the magnitude of another independent variable.
Difference-in-difference models, which measure the difference in outcome over time for the treatment
group compared to the difference in outcome over time for the control group, are examples of models
with interaction terms. Although interaction terms are used widely in applied econometrics, and the
correct way to interpret them is known by many econometricians and statisticians, most applied
researchers misinterpret the coefficient of the interaction term in nonlinear models. A review of the 13
economics journals listed on JSTOR found 72 articles published between 1980 and 1999 that used
interaction terms in nonlinear models. None of the studies interpreted the coefficient on the interaction
term correctly. The recent paper by DeLeire (2000) is a welcome exception.
In linear models the interpretation of the coefficient of the interaction between two variables is

straightforward. Let the continuous dependent variable y depend on two independent variables x 1 and
x 2 , their interaction, a vector of additional independent variables X including the constant term
independent of x 1 and x 2 , and b s are unknown parameters. If x 1 and x 2 are continuous, the interaction
effect of the independent variables x 1 and x 2 is the cross-derivative of the expected value of y

If x 1 and x 2 are dichotomous, then the interaction effect of a change in both x 1 and x 2 from zero to
one is found by taking discrete differences

The statistical significance of the interaction effect can be tested with a single t-test on the coefficient

The intuition from linear models, however, does not extend to nonlinear models. To illustrate,
consider a probit model similar to the previous example, except that the dependent variable y is a
dummy variable. The conditional mean of the dependent variable is

However, most applied economists instead compute the marginal effect of the interaction term,
which is ≠Fs ?d / ≠sx 1 x 2d 5 b12 F 9s ?d. Perhaps this is because statistical software packages, such as
Stata  7, compute the marginal effect for any explanatory variable. However, Eq. (2) shows clearly
that the interaction effect is not equal to b12 F 9s ?d.
There are four important implications of Eq. (2) for nonlinear models. Firstly, the interaction effect
could be nonzero, even if b12 5 0. For the probit model with b12 5 0, the interaction effect is

Secondly, the statistical significance of the interaction effect cannot be tested with a simple t-test on
the coefficient of the interaction term b12 . Thirdly, the interaction effect is conditional on the
independent variables, unlike the interaction effect in linear models. (It is well known that the
marginal effect of a single uninteracted variable in a nonlinear model is conditional on the
independent variables.) Fourthly, the interaction effect may have different signs for different values of
covariates. Therefore, the sign of b12 does not necessarily indicate the sign of the interaction effect.
In order to improve best practice by applied econometricians, we derive the formulas for the
magnitude and standard errors of the estimated interaction effect in general nonlinear models. The

formulas apply easily to logit, probit, and other nonlinear models. We illustrate our points with an
example.

2. Estimation
We begin by introducing notation for general nonlinear models. Let y denote the raw dependent
variable. Let the vector x be a k 3 1 vector of independent variables, so x9 5sx 1 . . . x kd. The expected
value of y given x is
Ef yuxg 5 Fsx, bd,

(3)

where the function F is known up to b and is twice continuously differentiable. Let D denote either
the difference or the derivative operator, depending on whether the regressors are discrete or
continuous. For example, DFsx, bd /Dx 1 denotes the derivative if x 1 is continuous and the difference if
x 1 is continuous. The key point of this paper is that the interaction effect is found by computing cross
derivatives (or differences), not by just looking at the coefficient on the interaction term. The
interaction effect of x 1 and x 2 on y is

where Vˆ b is a consistent covariance estimator of bˆ . The t statistic is t 5 mˆ 12 / sˆ 12 , which has an
asymptotic standard normal distribution under some regularity conditions. Use the t statistic to test the
hypothesis that the interaction effect equals zero, for given x.
Eq. (3) encompasses many commonly used models, including logit, probit, tobit, censored
regression models, log transformation models with normal errors, count models, and duration models.
Interaction terms between three or more variables are found in an analogous way.

3. Empirical example
To illustrate our points, we estimated a logit model to predict HMO enrolment as a function of
three continuous variables—age, number of activities of daily living (a count from 0 to 6 of the
number of basic physical activities a person has trouble performing), and the percent of the county
population enrolled in a HMO—and their interactions (Mello et al., 2002). The data are primarily
from the 1993–1996 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, a longitudinal survey of Medicare
eligibles. There are 38,185 observations at the person–year level, after excluding persons who lived in
counties not served by a Medicare HMO. The dependent variable is a dummy variable indicating
whether the individual is enrolled in a HMO. About 12% are in HMOs. The average age is 77 years,
65% have no limitations in ADLs, the average number of limitations is one, and the average market
penetration is 9% with a range from 0.0001 to 0.52. Data on market penetration are from the Medicare
Market Penetration File.
The model was run twice, once with an interaction between age and ADLs, and once with an
interaction between age and market penetration. A person is more likely to join a HMO if they are
younger, have fewer ADLs, and live in a county with high HMO market penetration.
The coefficient on the interaction term between age and ADLs is negative and statistically
significant (see Table 1). However, the magnitude and statistical significance of the interaction effect
varies by observation. For many observations with a predicted value of being enrolled in a HMO less
than 0.2, the interaction effect is positive, not negative (see Fig. 1A). The concave line drawn for
reference is the marginal effect of the interaction term computed by b12 F9s ?d. The statistical
significance of the interaction effect is often stronger when the interaction effect is positive than when
negative, with t-statistics as high as 10 (see Fig. 1B).

In the second model the interaction term between age and market penetration is negative but not
statistically significant. Again, the interaction effect varies widely, and is positive for many
observations (see Fig. 2A). Even though the interaction term is itself not statistically significant, the
interaction effect is significant for most observations (see Fig. 2B).
Having plotted the interaction effect for many logit and probit models with different data sets, we
can say that these two examples are typical. The interaction effect always follows an S-shaped pattern

when plotted against predicted probability. It crosses the (incorrect) reference line b12 F9s ?d close to
Fs ?d 5 0.5. The interaction effect is always positive for some observations and negative for others.
Unlike the marginal effect of a single variable, the results are strongest, in both magnitude and
statistical significance, for values of predicated probability not near 0.5. The results are virtually
identical for logit and probit models run on the same data.

4. Conclusion
The interaction effect, which is often the variable of interest in applied econometrics, cannot be
evaluated simply by looking at the sign, magnitude, or statistical significance of the coefficient on the
interaction term when the model is nonlinear. Instead, the interaction effect requires computing the
cross derivative or cross difference. Like the marginal effect of a single variable, the magnitude of the
interaction effect depends on all the covariates in the model. In addition, it can have different signs for
different observations, making simple summary measures of the interaction effect difficult.
We present a consistent estimator for the interaction effect (cross-difference) for nonlinear model,
and for the asymptotic variance of the estimated interaction effect. An example shows that not
calculating the correct interaction effect would lead to wrong inference in a substantial percentage of
the sample. Sample programs are available from the authors upon request.
