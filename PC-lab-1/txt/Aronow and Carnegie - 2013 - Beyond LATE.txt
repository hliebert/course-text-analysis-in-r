Political scientists frequently use instrumental variables (IV) estimation to estimate the causal effect of an en
dogenous treatment variable. However, when the treatment effect is heterogeneous, this estimation strategy
only recovers the local average treatment effect (LATE). The LATE is an average treatment effect (ATE) for a

subset of the population: units that receive treatment if and only if they are induced by an exogenous IV.

However, researchers may instead be interested in the ATE for the entire population of interest. In this
article, we develop a simple reweighting method for estimating the ATE, shedding light on the identification
challenge posed in moving from the LATE to the ATE. We apply our method to two published experiments in
political science in which we demonstrate that the LATE has the potential to substantively differ from the ATE.

1 Introduction

Instrumental variables (IV) estimation, although commonly used in political science, is s
an often overlooked limitation. IV estimation (Wald 1940) allows researchers to estimate
effect of an endogenous treatment variable through the use of an exogenous variable kn

IV. However, although many researchers intend to estimate the average treatment effect (AT

the entire population of interest, IV estimation only recovers the local average treatme
(LATE) or the ATE for the subpopulation that is influenced by the IV. When treatment e
heterogeneous across units, the LATE and the ATE may take on different values—pot
causing complications in interpretation.
Several influential papers, including Deaton (2009) and Heckman and Urzua (2010), h
pressed concern about the interpretation of the LATE. Both papers argue that the LA

estimating the LATE (Deaton 2009, 430) and the LATE "is often very difficult to interp

(2010, 35) add that reliance on IV estimation often means that "problems of identifica

2 IV Estimation

Political scientists frequently contend with problems of endogeneity, which occur wh
of interest is systematically related to unobserved causes of the outcome variable. Endoge

arise for a variety of reasons, including selection bias, simultaneity, or measuremen
popular method for dealing with endogeneity is IV estimation, which can be underst
two frameworks: the SEM framework and the potential outcomes framework. Th

work is most familiar to political scientists, and so we begin with it. However, IV estimat

context of this framework introduces the rigid—and perhaps implausible—assumption
treatment effects. The potential outcomes model relaxes this assumption, but also

causal estimand.

2.1 IV in an SEM Framework

The SEM interpretation of IV estimation posits a linear, additive relationship between an out
variable (Yt), an endogenous treatment variable (£>,), covariates (Q\„ Qu....Qki), and an unobs
error term (w,) for each unit i, such that

assumption using the potential outcomes framework developed by Angrist
(1996), which shows that the IV estimator will identify the LATE even when
heterogeneous. In the following section, we introduce the potential outcome
the implications of identifying the LATE.

2.2 IV in a Potential Outcomes Framework

We now move to the Neyman-Rubin potential outcomes framework, focusing on the case of
binary IV (or treatment assignment) Z and a binary endogenous treatment variable (or treatme

received) D. Suppose that we have a sample consisting of n units (indexed i = 1,2, ...,«) in

pendently drawn with equal probability from some large population of interest. For unit i, let Fo, b
the outcome if untreated, D, = 0, and let Yu be the outcome if treated, D, = 1. The treatment effect
for a given unit / is the difference between unit f s outcomes in both possible states of the world,

Y\i — Fo,-. Similarly, we may define Do, as the treatment condition of unit i when assigned
control, Z, = 0, and Di, as the treatment condition of unit i when assigned to treatment, Z, =
We will show that the causal estimand recovered by IV estimation will not generally be the A
E(Y"i — y0), but will instead be the LATE, E(Fi — To|Di > Do).
Following Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin (1996), the population may be divided into four grou
always-takers, never-takers, compliers, and defiers. Always-takers are units that receive treatment

regardless of whether they are assigned to treatment or control, so that Do, = 1 and Du = 1
Conversely, never-takers do not receive treatment regardless of their treatment assignment,

that D0, = 0 and Du = 0. Compliers receive treatment if assigned to treatment and do n
receive treatment if assigned to control, so that Do, = 0 and Du = 1 (or Du > Do,). Defie

for students in high-quality schools; Arceneaux and Nickerson (2009) find that the mobilizing effects of canvassing
larger for high-propensity voters.

Pr(A) > D\) = 0. Fifth, we assume that Z, is randomly assigned and thus independent of all po
tential outcomes. As no parametric assumptions are necessary, these assumptions are considerably
weaker than (and subsumed by) those of the SEM framework.
Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin (1996) demonstrate that these five assumptions imply that
the "intention-to-treat" effect of Z, on Yt (the average effect of treatment assignment on the
outcome) divided by the intention-to-treat (ITT) effect of Z on D (the average effect of treatment
assignment on treatment received) is equal to the average causal treatment effect for compliers:

prv v in n \ E(F|Z = 1) — E(Y\Z = 0)
( 1 ol 1 > o) E(D|Z = 1) — E(Z)|Z = 0)
The LATE, E(Y] — Y(i\D\ > D0), can therefore be estimated with

(tz,A)/(gZi)-(t<i-ZiM)/(£<i-Zi>)
or, equivalently, the bivariate 2SLS estimator. This estimator is consistent but not unbiased; it is
subject to finite sample bias because it is a ratio estimator. When Z, is randomly assigned (and
therefore unrelated to covariates), the addition of covariates to the 2SLS model will also yield
consistent estimation of the LATE (Angrist and Pischke 2009).2 Intuitively, 2SLS rescales the ITT
effect of Z, on Yh acknowledging that only compliers will respond to changes in Z,.
Because IV estimation provides asymptotically unbiased estimates of the LATE even when
treatment effects are heterogeneous, IV estimation has become the de facto standard for causal
inference in studies with noncompliance in the social sciences. However, as discussed in Section 1,
researchers are often interested in the ATE rather than the LATE. In the next section, we present a

method that allows for estimation of the ATE, albeit with a stronger set of assumptions for
consistency.
3 From LATE to ATE

Although the LATE is a well-defined estimand, it is nevertheless only applicab
subpopulation: compliers. To address this problem, we provide a method to es
using the intuition behind IPW, a commonly used method to estimate populatio
from nonrepresentative samples. IPW entails weighting units by the inverse of

sample inclusion (Horvitz and Thompson 1952) to asymptotically recover
quantities. ICSW follows the same logic, but weights units by the inverse of

and present a new ML estimator to estimate compliance scores even in the pr
noncompliance (wherein both always-takers and never-takers are present).

3.1 The Compliance Score

The compliance score is a latent pretreatment covariate that represents the pr
complier, conditional on a unit's pretreatment covariate profile X (so that XJ

However, when multiple and/or continuous covariates are available, it is usef

Given the assumptions outlined in the previous section, we know that the co

After estimating 0A,c and $aia,c> we may estimate the compliance score for unit i,

Pa = Pr(A > D0|X = x() = F(0A,cXi)(l - F(0A|A,cXi))3.
Although the ML estimator imposes parametric assumptions about the relationship between the
covariates and the compliance score, these assumptions may be relaxed to arbitrary generality
(given data constraints) by including interactions in and nonlinear transformations (e.g., polyno
mial expansion, splines) of X. A natural extension would be a sieve-type estimator (Geman and
Hwang 1982), which would facilitate nonparametric estimation of the compliance score.

3.2 ICSW

How does the compliance score help solve the problem of reliance on the LAT
ment effects are heterogeneous? Recall that the basic problem addressed by th
estimation only generates estimates of the ATE for compilers. We propose a r

that we refer to as ICSW.4 ICSW follows the logic of IPW: if one type of unit is di
represented, we may reweight the sample to reflect the distribution in the target
We provide a simple example to illustrate how the method works. Imagine an exp

treatment effect for males is 0, but the treatment effect for females is 1. If male

3As suggested above, in the case of one-sided noncompliance, such that the probability of being an
to zero, the likelihood function reduces to

L(ec\D,Z) = n?=l[(f*0A,c xOZ,-)"' + (1 - F(0A,cxi)Z,)|-ß'].

This likelihood function is a familiar one: it is the standard likelihood function for binomial regres
units in the treatment condition. With one-sided noncompliance and F(-) = $(■), our ML estimator

3.4 ICSW Assumptions
In order to consistently estimate the ATE using ICSW, three additional assumptions are required.
In the appendix, we demonstrate that ICSW is consistent under Assumptions 1-3, along with the IV

assumptions and suitable regularity conditions.

5The method can be generalized to applications using continuous endogenous variables and multivalued (or multiple)
instruments. As Angrist and Imbens (1995) demonstrate, with continuous endogenous variables, 2SLS produces a
weighted average of grouped data IV estimators. With multiple instruments, 2SLS is a weighted average (efficient
under homoskedasticity) of the 2SLS estimator for each instrument. Although detailing such extensions is beyond
the scope of the article, under the assumptions outlined here, the ATE could be estimated for each instrument and a
weighted average could be produced for the overall ATE.
6In order to prevent very small compliance scores from forming in finite samples, we Winsorize our estimates. Define c
as the 1 /n° th quantile of Pa, where a is a positive calibrating constant. We replace all Pa < c with c. We recommend
(and use in this article) a = 0.275, which performed well in simulation studies presented in the supplementary appendix.
Winsorizing is performed because very low probabilities can introduce instability in the estimates resulting from IPW

(Elliott 2009), but Winsorizing may sometimes increase finite sample bias. Asymptotically, assuming that a remains
fixed, the Winsorization has no impact on estimation, because c —> 0 as n -* oo. In fact, non-Winsorized estimates
represent a special case of this Winsorization process whenever or -> oo.

7For IPW-style estimators, analytic variance estimators presuming correct model specification may be highly sensitive to
model misspecification and inaccurate in finite samples, whereas the bootstrap tends to have better coverage (Funk et al.

2011). In our own simulation studies, assuming a = 0.275, we find that the bootstrap has conservative coverage for
ICSW in small samples, and proper coverage in larger samples. These studies are presented in the supplementary
appendix.

But what if treatment effects are heterogeneous and we have failed to identify the sufficient

asymptotically. However, ICSW will still recover an internally valid causal effect, not on the full
population of interest, but for some population that has a covariate profile that matches that of the

full population. To see this, we can compare two expressions. Through simple manipulation of
expectations, the LATE may be written as

with Rubin (2009), who argues that the most principled conditioning strategy is one that
includes all known pretreatment covariates.8
Assumption 2.

Consistency of Pa for PCi. Assumption 2 amounts to requiring proper specification of the ML
estimator. Application of a flexible parametrization of the covariates in X, as is possible with large
samples, will necessarily yield consistency, so long as the rate of growth in the number of estimated
parameters is sufficiently slow in n. In the case of a saturated model and F{.) as the normal CDF,
Pa will be unbiased for the conditional probability of compliance.

Assumption 3.

For all x e Supp(X), Pr(Z>i > Z>0|X = x) e (e, 1], where e > 0. Note that IV estimation already
requires the assumption of nonzero compliance in the full population, and we generalize this as
sumption to every covariate profile. This assumption has both theoretical and practical implica
tions. If Assumption 3 fails, then the ATE cannot generally be estimated using the variation
induced by Z: the instrument simply does not cause any variation in the treatment received by
some types of units. In practice, if a unit has zero probability of compliance, the weighting pro
cedure will produce infinite weights asymptotically, leading to an undefined estimate. Conditional
on the validity of Assumptions 1 and 2, Assumption 3 is therefore verifiable in large samples.

4 Applications

We now present two case studies: Green, Gerber, and Nickerson (2003) and Albertson and
Lawrence (2009). We select these two articles because they allow us to display the use of our
method in the intuitive case of one-sided noncompliance as well as the more complex case of
two-sided noncompliance.9

4.1 Green, Gerber, and Nicker son (2003)
Green, Gerber, and Nickerson (2003) present results from a large-scale (n = 18,933) field experi
ment designed to assess the effect of canvassing on voter turnout. Registered voters in Bridgeport,

Columbus, Detroit, Minneapolis, Raleigh, and St. Paul were randomly assigned to treatment or
control, where the treatment was encouragement to vote in advance of the November 6, 2001, local

elections. Encouragement was delivered in the form of face-to-face contact with nonpartisan
student and community organization members. Because some citizens who were assigned to the
treatment group could not be contacted, the study features one-sided noncompliance. To get
around this limitation, the authors use the attempt to administer the treatment as an instrument
for the receipt of the treatment to consistently estimate the LATE. These results are presented in
column (1) of Table 1. Among compliers, canvassing is estimated to increase turnout by 5.6
percentage points with a confidence interval of (2.2,8.9).10

8Data constraints (e.g., a large number of covariates or small n) may prevent inclusion of all covariates, in which case
some dimension reduction or variable selection may be necessary. Fodor (2002) provides a review of such methods.
9Replication data for these applications are available at Aronow and Carnegie (2013).
l0The estimates presented differ slightly from those in the original paper because the original paper used one-way fixed
effects for randomization strata, which is inconsistent in the presence of heterogeneous probabilities of assignment to
treatment. In general, when using a covariate conditioning strategy, linear regression and IV estimators produce esti
mates reweighted by the conditional variance of the instrument (Angrist and Pischke 2009; Humphreys 2009). We
instead use IPW, which is consistent in this example.

Albertson and Lawrence (2009) present findings from an exper

whether they supported a California proposition (209) to eliminate a

measure, we see that Albertson and Lawrence's (2009) 2SLS estimate an

nearly identical at —0.07 points and -0.05 points, respectively. We therefore
viewing the debate on support for compliers is very similar to the estim
possible interpretations. Since we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no tre

the LATE or the ATE, we may suspect that there is no effect on attit

treatment. Alternatively, if we believe there is a small treatment effect, we

the LATE diverges from the ATE.13
5 Conclusion

IV methods have grown in popularity in recent years, due to their ability to overcome p

endogeneity and selection bias. However, our results suggest that researchers shoul
attention to the estimand when using this popular method, as the LATE can differ
from the ATE. When the ATE is the target parameter, ICSW may be a more sensib
than is standard IV. As the use of IV methods continues to expand, this type of re
discussion of the causal quantity of interest will only grow in importance.

13The difference in coefficients for knowledge, tATe — Îlate, has a 95% confidence interval of (—0.02
confidence interval of (0.00, 0.52). The difference in coefficients for opinion has a 95% confidence in
0.16) and a 90% confidence interval of (—0.08, 0.12).

Appendix: ICSW Consistency
We derive expressions for the inverse compliance score weighted numerator (average ITT effect)

and denominator (average probability of compliance) of equation (3), thus obtaining the
asymptotic value of the IV estimator after ICSW. For clarity, we remove i subscripts to denote
all units subject to any conditional probabilities articulated. As in equation (3),

ITT = Pr(Z>i > Z)0)E(Fi — Yq\D\ > Do), which we may express as a weighted average of
conditional ITTs:

ITT JÇi
= f Pr(Z>i > A)|X = x)E(7i - Y0\Di > D0,X = \)f(x)d\. (8)
With the equations above, we are now able to apply ICSW, multiplying by the inverse of the
i

compliance score:Pr(Z),>D0|X=x)
p—n—L IX= ... We then divide by the average weight across all units (to normalize

the weight). We define the average weight wc = fn pr(p,>j?0|x=x/^x)^x
We can write the weighted ITT as follows:

ITT- = 1 ( P'(J' > °'IXp=nE(rA7v' J,|X = «
Since the Pr(Z)i > Do|X = x) terms cancel, equation (9) reduces to

ITT»WcJn
= -L f E(F, - Y0\Di >D0,X = x)ßx)dx. (10)
Applying Assumption 1, we can rewrite equation (10) as ITTW — E(Ti — 70|X = x)f(x)dx. By
the law of total probability, the reweighted numerator of the IV estimator is

ITT" E(F,
- Y0|X = x)fix)dx = 1 E(7, - Y0). (11)
