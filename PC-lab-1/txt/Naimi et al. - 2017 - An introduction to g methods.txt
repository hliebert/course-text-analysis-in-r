Abstract
Robins’ generalized methods (g methods) provide consistent estimates of contrasts (e.g.
differences, ratios) of potential outcomes under a less restrictive set of identification conditions than do standard regression methods (e.g. linear, logistic, Cox regression).
Uptake of g methods by epidemiologists has been hampered by limitations in understanding both conceptual and technical details. We present a simple worked example
that illustrates basic concepts, while minimizing technical complications.
Key words: G Methods; Marginal Structural Model; Structural Nested Model; G Formula; Inverse Probability
Weighting; G Estimation; Monte Carlo Estimation

Key Messages
• G methods include inverse probability weighted marginal structural models, g estimation of a structural nested

model, and the g formula.
• G methods estimate contrasts of potential outcomes under a less restrictive set of assumptions than standard regres-

sion methods.
• Inverse probability weighting generates a pseudo-population in which exposures are independent of confounders,

enabling estimation of marginal structural model parameters.
• G estimation exploits the conditional independence between the exposure and potential outcomes to estimate struc-

tural nested model parameters.
• The g formula models the joint density of the observed data to generate potential outcomes under different exposure

scenarios.

Robins’ g methods enable the identification and estimation
of the effects of generalized treatment, exposure, or intervention plans. G methods are a family of methods that
include the g formula, marginal structural models, and
structural nested models. They provide consistent estimates
of contrasts (e.g. differences, ratios) of average potential

outcomes under a less restrictive set of identification conditions than standard regression methods (e.g. linear, logistic, Cox regression).1 Specifically, standard regression
requires no feedback between time-varying treatments and
time-varying confounders, while g methods do not. Robins
and Hernan1 have provided a technically comprehensive

present a corresponding worked example that illustrates
the need for and use of g methods, while minimizing technical details.

where expectations EðÞ are taken with respect to the target
population from which our sample is a random draw. This
average causal effect consists of the joint effect of A0 and
A1 on Y.2 Here, Y a0 ;a1 represents a potential outcome value
that would have been observed had the exposures been set
to specific levels a0 and a1. This potential outcome is distinct from the observed (or actual) outcome.
This average causal effect w ¼ EðY a0 ;a1  Y 0;0 Þ is a marginal effect because it averages (or marginalizes) over all
individual-level effects in the population. We can write this
effect as EðY a0 ;a1  Y 0;0 Þ ¼ w0 a0 þ w1 a1 þ w2 a0 a1 , which
states that our average causal effect w may be composed of
two exposure main effects (e.g., w0 and w1) and their twoway interaction (w2). This marginal effect w is indifferent
to whether the A1 component (w1 þ w2 ) is modified by Z1:
whether such effect modification is present or absent, the
marginal effect represents a meaningful answer to the question: what is the effect of A0 and A1 in the entire
population?
Alternatively, we may wish to estimate this effect conditional on certain values of another covariate. A conditional
effect would arise if, for example, one was specifically
interested in effect measure modification by Z1. When
properly modeled, this conditional effect represents a
meaningful answer to the question: what is the effect of A0
and A1 in those who receive Z1 ¼ 1 versus those who
receive Z1 ¼ 0? Modeling such effect measure modification by time-varying covariates is the fundamental issue
that distinguishes marginal structural from structural
nested models. We thus return to this issue later. For simplicity, we define our effect of interest as
w ¼ w0 þ w1 þ w2 , and we explore a data example with no
effect modification by time-varying confounders.

Our research question concerns the effect of treatment for
HIV on CD4 count. Table 1 presents data from a hypothetical observational cohort study (A ¼ 1 for treated, A ¼ 0
otherwise). Treatment is measured at baseline (A0) and
once during follow up (A1). The sole covariate is elevated
HIV viral load (Z ¼ 1 for those with > 200 copies/ml,
Z ¼ 0 otherwise), which is constant by design at baseline
(Z0 ¼ 1) and measured once during follow up just prior to
the second treatment (Z1). The outcome is CD4 count
measured at the end of follow up in units of cells/mm3. The
CD4 outcome in Table 1 is summarized (averaged) over
the participants at each level of the treatments and covariate. The number of participants is provided in the rightmost column of Table 1. In this hypothetical study of one
million participants we ignore random error and focus on
identifying the parameters defining our causal effect of
interest, which we describe next.
Based on Figure 1, the average outcome in our simple
data generating structure may be composed of several
parts: the effects of A0, Z1, and A1; the two-way interactions between A0 and Z1, A0 and A1, and A1 and Z1; and
the three-way interaction between A0, Z1, and A1. These
components (some whose magnitudes may be zero) can be
used to “build up” a contrast of substantive interest. Here,
we focus on the average causal effect of always taking
treatment (a0 ¼ 1; a1 ¼ 1) compared to never taking treatment (a0 ¼ 0; a1 ¼ 0),

Yet we cannot directly acquire information on these averages because in any given sample, some individuals will be
unexposed (or exposed). Part of our task therefore involves
justifying use of averages among subsets of the population
as what would be observed in the whole population. This
is accomplished by making three main assumptions.
Counterfactual consistency3 allows us to equate
observed outcomes among those who received a certain
exposure value to the potential outcomes that would be
observed under the same exposure value:

The status of this assumption remains unaffected by the
choice of analytic method (e.g., standard regression versus
g methods). Rather, this assumption’s validity depends on
the nature of the exposure assignment mechanism.4 Under
counterfactual consistency, we partially identify our average causal effect.
Next, we assume exchangeability.5 Exchangeability
implies that the potential outcomes under exposures a0 and
a1 (denoted Y a0 ;a1 ) are independent of the actual (or
observed) exposures A0 and A1. We make this exchangeability assumption within levels of past covariate values
(conditional) and at each time point separately
(sequential):
EðY a0 ;a1 jA1 ; Z1 ; A0 Þ ¼ EðY a0 ;a1 jZ1 ; A0 Þ; and
EðY a0 ;a1 jA0 Þ ¼ EðY a0 ;a1 Þ:

(1)
(2)

This sequential conditional exchangeability assumption
would hold if there were no uncontrolled confounding and
no selection bias. Equation 1 says that, within levels of
prior viral load (Z1) and a given treatment level A0, Y a0 ;a1
does not depend on the assigned values of A1. Equation 2
says that Y a0 ;a1 does not depend on the assigned values of
A0. Note the correspondence between these two equations
and the causal diagram: because in Figure 1, Z1 is a common cause of A1 and Y, the assumption in equation 1 must
be made conditional on Z1. Failing to condition for Z1 will
result in uncontrolled confounding of the effect of A1, and
thus a dependence between the actual A1 value and the
potential outcome. However, adjusting for Z1 using standard methods (restriction, stratification, matching, or conditioning in a linear regression model) would block part of
the effect from A0 through Z1, and potentially lead to a
collider bias of the effect of A0 through U.6 This is the central challenge that g methods were developed to address.
The third assumption, known as positivity,7 requires 0 < P
ðA1 ¼ 1jZ1 ¼ z1 ; A0 ¼ a0 Þ < 1 and 0 < PðA0 ¼ 1Þ < 1.
Furthermore, this assumption must hold for all values of a0
and z1 where PðA0 ¼ a0 ; Z1 ¼ z1 Þ > 0. This latter condition is required so that effects are not defined in strata of a0

and z1 that do not exist. Positivity is met when there are
exposed and unexposed individuals within all confounder
and prior exposure levels, which can be evaluated
empirically.
Under these three assumptions, our hypothetical observational study can be likened to a sequentially randomized
trial in which the exposure was randomized at baseline,
and randomized again at time 1 with a probability that
depends on Z1. Under these assumptions, g methods can
be used to estimate counterfactual quantities with observational data. In the Supplementary Material, we provide
SAS code (SAS Institue, Cary, NC) in which standard
regression and all three g methods are fit to the hypothetical data in Table 1.

Our interest lies in the marginal mean of Y that would
be observed if A0 and A1 were set to some values a0 and a1,
respectively. To obtain this expectation, we perform two
mathematical operations on the factored joint density. The
first is the well-known expectation operator,8ðp47Þ which
allows us to write the conditional mean of Y in terms of its
conditional density. The second is the law of total probability,8ðp12Þ which allows us to marginalize over the distribution of A1, Z1 and A0, yielding the marginal mean of Y:

We can now modify this equation to yield the average

This equation is the g formula; its proof, given in the
Supplementary Material, follows from the three identifying assumptions. In our simple scenario, the expectation
EðY 0;0 Þ can be calculated by summing the mean CD4
count in the never treated with Z1 ¼ 1 (weighted by the
proportion of people with Z1 ¼ 1 in the A0 ¼ 0 stratum)

mechanism for all variables in Table 1. We refer to this as
the joint density of the observed data. We factor the joint
density in a way that respects the temporal ordering of the
data by conditioning each variable on its history. For
example, if f ðÞ represents the probability density function,
then by the definition of conditional probabilities8ðp36Þ we
can factor this joint density as

and the mean CD4 count in the never treated with Z1 ¼ 0
(weighted by the proportion of people with Z1 ¼ 0 in the
A0 ¼ 0 stratum). Weighting the observed outcome’s conditional expectation by the conditional probability that
Z1 ¼ z1 enables us to account for the fact that Z1 is
affected by A0, but also confounds the effect of A1 on Y.
Computing this expectation’s value yields a result of
^ 0;0 Þ ¼ 100:0, where we use E^ to denote a sample,
EðY
rather than a population average, and with the under^ 0;0 Þ is equal to the g formula with A0
standing that EðY
¼ A1 ¼ 0 (since the potential outcomes Y 0;0 are not
directly observed). We repeat the process to obtain the
corresponding value for treated at time 0 only:
^ 1;0 Þ ¼ 125:0; treated at time 1 only: EðY
^ 0;1 Þ ¼ 125:0;
EðY
^ ¼ 150:0
^ 1;1 Þ ¼ 150:0. Thus, w
and always treated: EðY
GF
100:0 ¼ 50:0, which is the average causal effect of treatment on CD4 cell count.
This approach to computing the value of the g formula
is referred to as nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation. Several authors9–13 demonstrate how simulation
from parametric regression models can yield a g formula
estimator, which is often required in typical populationhealth studies with many covariates.
Modeling each component of the joint density of the
observed data (including the probability that Z1 ¼ z1) can
lead to bias if any of these models are mis-specified. To
compute the expectations of interest, we can instead specify a single model that targets our average causal effect,
and avoid unnecessary modeling. Marginal structural models map a marginal summary (e.g., average) of potential
outcomes to the treatment and parameter of interest w.
Unlike the g formula, they do not require a model for
PðZ1 ¼ z1 jA0 ¼ a0 Þ. Additionally, as we show in the
Supplementary Material, while they cannot model it
directly, they are indifferent to whether time-varying effect
modification is present or absent. Because our interest lies
in the marginal contrast of outcomes under always versus
never treated conditions, our marginal structural model for
the effect of A can be written as EðY a0 ;a1 Þ ¼ b0 þ w0 a0
þw1 a1 þ w2 a0 a1 , where b0 ¼ EðY 0;0 Þ is a (nuisance) intercept parameter, and w ¼ EðY 1;1  Y 0;0 Þ ¼ ðw0 þ w1 þ w2 Þ
is the effect of interest.
Inverse probability weighting can be used estimate marginal structural model parameters (proofs are provided in
the Supplementary Material). To estimate w using inverse
probability weighted regression, we first obtain the predicted probabilities of the observed treatments. In our
example data, there are two possible A1 values (exposed,
unexposed) for each of the four levels in Z1 and A0.
Additionally, there are two possible A0 values (exposed,
unexposed) overall. This leads to four possible exposure
regimes: never treat, treat early only, treat late only, and

Structural nested models map a conditional contrast of
potential outcomes to the treatment, within nested sub-groups
of individuals defined by levels of A1, Z1, and A0. Our structural nested model can be written with two equations as
EðY a0 ;a1  Y a0 ;0 jA0 ¼ a0 ; Z1 ¼ z1 ; A1 ¼ a1 Þ
¼ a1 ðw1 þ w2 a0 þ w3 z1 þ w4 a0 z1 Þ
EðY

Y

jA0 ¼ a0 Þ ¼ w0 a0

Note this model introduces two additional parameters: w3
for the two-way interaction between a1 and z1, and w4 for
the three-way interaction between a1, z1, and a0. Indeed,
the ability to explicitly quantify interactions between timevarying exposures and time-varying covariates (which cannot be modeled via standard marginal structural models) is
a major strength of structural nested models when effect
modification is of interest.1 To simplify our exposition, we
set ðw3 ; w4 Þ ¼ ð0; 0Þ in our data example, allowing us to
drop the w3 z1 and w4 a0 z1 terms from the model. In effect,
this renders our structural nested mean model equivalent to
a semi-parametric marginal structural model. In the
Supplementary Material, we explain how marginal structural and structural nested models each relate to timevarying interactions in more detail.
We can now use gestimation to estimate ðw0 ; w1 ; w2 Þ in
the above structural nested model. Gestimation is based on
solving equations that directly result from the sequential
conditional exchangeability assumptions in (1) and (2),
combined with assumptions implied by the structural
nested model. If, at each time point, the exposure is conditionally independent of the potential outcomes (sequential
exchangeability) then the conditional covariance between
the exposure and potential outcomes is zero.14 Formally,
these conditional independence relations can be written as:
0 ¼ CovðY a0 ;0 ; A1 jZ1 ; A0 Þ
¼ CovðY 0;0 ; A0 Þ
where CovðÞ is the well-known covariance formula.8ðp52Þ
These equalities are of little direct use for estimation,
though, as they contain unobserved potential outcomes
and are not yet functions of the parameters of interest.
However, by counterfactual consistency and the structural
nested model, we can replace these unknowns with quantities estimable from the data.
Specifically, as we prove in the Supplementary
Material, the structural nested model, together with
exchangeability and counterfactual consistency imply that
we can replace the potential outcomes Y a0 ;0 and Y 0;0 in the
above covariance formulas with their values derived from
the structural nested model, yielding:

always treat. For each Z1 value, we require the predicted
probability of the exposure that was actually received.
These probabilities are computed by calculating the appropriate proportions of subjects in Table 1. Because there are
no variables that affect A0, this probability is 0.5 for all
individuals in the sample. Furthermore, in our example A1
is not affected by A0 (Figure 1). Thus, the Z1 specific probabilities of A1 are constant across levels of A0. In settings
where A0 affects A1, the Z1 specific probabilities of A1
would vary across levels of A0.
In the stratum defined by Z1 ¼ 1, the predicted probabilities of A1 ¼ 0 and A1 ¼ 1 are 0.308 and 0.692, respectively. For example, ð210; 527 þ 136; 293Þ=ð210; 527
þ 136; 293 þ 93; 903 þ 60; 654Þ ¼ 0:692. Thus, the probabilities for each treatment combination are: 0:5  0:308
¼ 0:155 (never treated), 0:5  0:308 ¼ 0:155 (treated
early only), 0:5  0:692 ¼ 0:346 (treated late only), and
0:5  0:692 ¼ 0:346 (always treated). Dividing the marginal probability of each exposure category (not stratified
by Z1) by these stratum specific probabilities gives stabilized weights of 1.617, 1.617, 0.725, and 0.725, respectively. For example, the never treated weight is
ð0:5  0:501Þ=ð0:5  0:308Þ ¼ 1:617. The same approach
is taken to obtain predicted probabilities and stabilized
weights in the stratum defined by Z1 ¼ 0. The weights and
weighted data are provided in Table 4.
Fitting this model in the weighted data given in Table 4

Weighting the observed data by the inverse of the probability of the observed exposure yields a “pseudo-population” (Table 4) in which treatment at the second time
point (A1) is no longer related to (and is thus no longer
confounded by) viral load just prior to the second time
point (Z1). Thus, weighting a conditional regression model
for the outcome by the inverse probability of treatment
enables us to account for the fact that Z1 both confounds
A1 and is affected by A0.

We provide an intuitive explanation for this substitution in the Supplementary Material. We also show how
these covariance relations yield three equations that can be
used to solve each of the unknowns in the above structural
nested model (w0 ; w1 ; w2 ). Two of the three equations yield
the following g estimators:

Note that to solve these equations we need to model
EðA1 jZ1 ; A0 Þ, which in practice we might assume can be
correctly specified as the predicted values from a logistic
model for A1. In our simple setting, the correctness of this
model is guaranteed by saturating it (i.e., conditioning the
model on Z1, A0 and their interaction).
As we show in the Supplementary Material, implementing these equations in software can be easily done using
either an instrumental variables (i.e., two-stage least
squares) estimator, or ordinary least squares.
Once the above parameters are estimated, the next step
is to subtract the effect of A1 and A1 A0 from Y to obtain
^ A1  w

Having constructed these data using the causal diagram
shown in Figure 1, we know the true effect of combined
treatment is indeed 50 cells/mm3 (25 cells/mm3 for each
exposure main effect) as well approximated by all three g
methods, but not by any of the standard regression models
we fit, with one exception. The final standard result presented in Table 2 correctly estimates the effect of the second treatment (an effect of 25 cells/mm3), as would be
expected from the causal diagram.
For the past several years, we have used the foregoing
simple example to initiate epidemiologists to g methods
with some success. Once having studied this simple example in detail, we recommend working through more comprehensive examples by Robins and Hernan1 and Hernan
and Robins.16 A recent tutorial2 may then be of further
use. G methods are becoming more common in epidemiologic research.17 We hope this commentary facilitates the
process of better understanding these useful methods.

The potential outcome under no treatment can be
thought of as a given subject’s baseline prognosis: in our
setting, individuals with poor baseline prognosis will have
low CD4 levels, no matter what their treatment status

one expects this baseline prognosis to be independent of
treatment status. G estimation exploits this independence
by assuming no uncontrolled confounding (conditional

on measured confounders), and assigning values to w
