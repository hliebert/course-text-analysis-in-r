SUMMARY

This paper considers the consequences for identifiability of introducing regressors into
the competing risks model of multistate duration analysis. We establish conditions under
which access to regressors overturns the nonidentification theorem of Cox and Tsiatis
for both proportional and accelerated failure time models.
Some key words: Competing risks model; Identifiability; Regressor.

1. INTRODUCTION

This paper considers the identification of the competing risks model when regressors
are part of the model specification. The classical competing risks model excludes
regressors. In that model there are J competing causes of failure indexed by the integers
I to J. Associated with each failure j there is a latent failure time, Tj, which is the time
to failure from cause j. The observed quantities are the duration to the first failure and
the associated cause of failure
(T, I) = {min (Tj), arg min (Tj)},
I

j

the identified minimum for the problem. In biology, T is the waiting time to death and
I is the cause of death. David & Moeschberger (1978) and Cox & Oakes (1984, Ch. 9)
discuss such models. In economics, Flinn & Heckman (1983a) apply a competing risks
model for unemployed workers, where T is the waiting time to the end of unemployment
and I indexes the reason for leaving unemployment, i.e. getting a job or dropping out
of the workforce. The problem posed in the competing risks literature is to identify the
joint distribution of latent failure times from the distribution of the identified minimum.
Cox (1962) and Tsiatis (1975) show that for any joint distribution of the latent failure
times there exists a joint distribution with independent failure times which gives the same
distribution of the identified minimum. This nonidentification theorem has led much
empirical work on multistate duration models to be conducted within an independent
risks paradigm.
In many applications of the competing risks model, there is considerable interest in
identifying the underlying distribution of latent failure times. Yashin, Manton & Stallard
(1986) demonstrate the importance of accounting for dependence among causes of death
in assessing the impact of eliminating one cause of death on overall mortality rates. In
behavioural or biological models with regressors, there is additional interest in determining the impact of the regressors on specific marginal failure time distributions. Thus

Yashin et al. (1986) investigate how smoking, blood pressure and body weight differentially affect the marginal distributions of times to death attributable to cancer, heart
disease and other illnesses. Flinn & Heckman (1982b) discuss how unemployment benefits
and other variables differentially affect exit rates from unemployment to out of the
workforce and to employment.
As a consequence of the Cox-Tsiatis theorem, in competing risks models without
regressors it is necessary to make functional form assumptions about the joint distribution
of failure times in order to identify the distribution. Basu & Ghosh (1978), David &
Moeschberger (1978) and Arnold & Brockett (1983) exemplify this approach.
The present paper establishes identifiability conditions for models with regressors. We
show that it is sometimes possible to identify the joint distribution of failure times without
invoking distributional assumptions and to further identify the functional dependence
of the marginal distributions on the regressors. We consider identification of competing
risks models in which each marginal distribution is a nonparametric verson of the Cox
(1972) proportional hazard model. We also present identifiability results for an accelerated
hazard competing risks model with regressors.
To simplify the exposition in this paper, we consider models with only two competing
failure times. All of our results can easily be generalized to competing risks models with
an arbitrary, but known finite number of latent failure times.

RISKS PROPORTIONAL

HAZARD

MODEL

Cox (1972) introduced the widely used proportional hazard model. His model specifies
the survivor function conditional on the regressors to be
(1)
S(t Ix) = exp {-Z(t)4(x)},
where Z(.) is the integrated hazard and +(x) is usually specified as eXPwhere p is a
vector of parameters. Assuming Z( t) is differentiable, the associated hazard is Z'( t)O (x).
One way to combine the Cox proportional hazard specification with the competing
risks model is to assume that each of the potential failure time distributions has a
proportional hazard specification, possibly with different integrated hazard functions and
different functional forms for 4 or different values of 18when + (x) = eXP.If independence
is assumed, then it is straightforward to specify the resulting competing risks model
(Kalbfleisch & Prentice, 1980, Ch. 7; Flinn & Heckman, 1983b).
We introduce dependence among latent failure times in the following way. In order
to generate random variables from an independent competing risks model we could
generate two independent random variables from a U(0, 1) distribution, U1 and U2, and
then solve S1(T1)= U1 and S2(T2)= U2 for the potential failure times T, and T2. This is
equivalent to solving the equations
(2)
Z(T) = -log U1{41(x)}l,
Z2(T2)= -log U2{02(x)} '
for T1 and T2. Dependence between T1 and T2 can be introduced by assuming that U1
and U2 are not necessarily independent. This implies that the joint survivor function of
T1 and T2 conditional on X = x is
(3)
S(tl, t2Ix) = K[exp{-Z1(t,) b1(x)}, exp {-Z2(t2)02(x)}],
where K is the distribution function for (U1, U2) and we assume that Z1(0) =0 and
Z2(0) = 0. If the marginal distributions are to be of the proportional hazard form, the
marginal distributions of K must be of the form yC for some c > 0.

The identifiabilityof the competing risks model

327

Clayton & Cuzick (1985) consider two generalizations of the proportional hazard
model, both of which are special cases of (3). The first generalization assumes that the
true model is an independent competing risks model with +(x) = eX1but that one of the
covariates is not observed. This implies the model
S(tl, t2lx)

= {

exp {-Zl(tl) eXPl+C1w}exp {-Z2(t2)

eX132+c2'}

dG(co),

(4)

where G is the distribution of the unobserved covariate, assumed independent of X, and
the integration is over the support of the unobserved covariate, fl. Defining

K(rj l,

112) = X

71 exp(cl1w)

1exP(c22w)

dG(w)

shows that (4) is a special case of (3). Hougaard (1986a, b) establishes that G must be
a positive stable distribution for the marginal distributions to be consistent with the
proportional hazard specification. Flinn & Heckman (1982a, 1983b), and Yashin et al.
(1986) also introduce dependence in a competing risks model using unobserved covariates.
A second approach taken by Clayton & Cuzick (1985) is to specify
Sf

{[exp {yZ,( tl)ol(x) + exp {YZ2(t2)02(X)}-l]
exp {-Zl(tl)41(x) - Z2(t2)42(x)}

(Y > 0

(y = 0).

This specification is also a special case of (3). In this case
K(rjl,

(Y

(^y = ?).

This specification of K has uniform marginal distributions for all y and therefore (5)
has marginal distributions that are consistent with a proportional hazard specification.
The independent competing risks model with proportional marginal hazards is a special
case where y = 0.
The following theorem gives sufficient conditions for the identifiability of Z1, Z2, 0f
and /2 as well as K for the model given by (3).
1. Assume that (T1, T2) has the joint survivorfunction as given in (3). Then
f2 and K are identifiedfrom the identifiedminimumof (T1, T2) underthe
following assumptions.
(i) K is continuously differentiablewith partial derivatives K1 and K2 and for i = 1, 2
the limit as n - oo of Ki(7lnT h2n) is finite for all sequences of '71n, q2n for which
-*1n->1 and 'J2n - 1 for n -* oo. We also assume that K is strictly increasing in each
of its arguments in all of [0, 1] x [0, 1].
(ii) Z1(1)= 1 Z2(1)= 1, 41(xo)= 1 and 402(Xo)= 1 for some fixed point xo in the
supportX.
2(X)} is (0, 00) x (0, oo).
(iii) Thesupportof {11(x),

we allow them to be oofor finite t.

for all t and x. For notational convenience we suppress the dependence of Q, and Q2
on x. It follows from Theorem 1 of Tsiatis (1975) that

Qll(t)=[dtl ]

'2=

Q21(

)

[t2],.=
t

From the expression for S it follows that
Q'(t) = -KI[exp {-Z1(t)01(x)}, exp {-Z2(t)02(x)}]

exp {-Zl(t)

1(x)}Z'(t) J(x).
Calculation of the ratio between Q' at an arbitrary x + xo in the support of X and Q'
at xo gives

KI[exp {-Z1(t)01(x)}, exp {-Z2(t)02(X)}] exp {-Z1(t)01(x)}Z'(t)01(x)
K [ exp I - Z,(t) 0 1(xo)} exp {-Z2(t)02(X0)}] exp {-Z1(t)01(xo)}Z'(t)01(xo)'
Cancelling Z'(t) and taking the limit as t->O0we get Xl1(x). We can thus identify X1(x)
for all x in the support of X. Using a parallel result for Q' we can identify 02.
Next observe that by setting t= 1 and letting l1(x) and +2(x) range over the set
(0, xo)x (0, oo), which can be done as a consequence of assumption 3, we trace out K.
To identify ZI(t), let +2(x) go to 0 holding l1(x)fixed. We can do this as a consequence
of assumption (iii). Then S(t, t) goes to a function H[exp {-Z1(t)01(x)}], where H is
a known increasing function since K is known and is increasing in its argument. Since
Xl is already identified, and Z1(t) = 1 by assumption, Z1 can be identified; Z2 is identified
O
in the same way.
Observe that fewer assumptions are required to identify f than are required to identify
K, and identification of K requires fewer assumptions than does the identification of the
Zi(.). The assumptions made in Theorem 1 deserve a few comments. Assumption (ii) is
an innocuous normalization. Multiplying Z, by a positive number and dividing {1 by
the same number has no effect on the survivor function. Thus without loss of generality
we can assume that Z1(1) = 1. With this normalization we can divide {A by a positive
number a and define a new K, K, by K(q1, a2)= K(7, i2). This redefinition has no
effect on the survivor function, so we can assume 1(xo) = 1 for some xo in the support
of x. The normalizations on Z2 and /2 are justified in the same way. The assumption
that Z1 and Z2 are strictly increasing and differentiable is necessary only in a neighbourhood of zero. Continuity of Z1 and Z2 implies that the potential failure times T1 and T2
have continuous distributions, and if Z1 and Z2 are strictly increasing then T1 and T2
both have convex support. Observe that Z1 or Z2 can be so. Thus the failure times are
permitted to have bounded support. We also do not need to assume that either Z1 or Z2
goes to so as t goes to oo which implies that we allow the potential failure times to be
infinite with positive probability so we do not exclude defective duration distributions.
Assumption (iii) is, for example, satisfied in the case where Obi(x)= exp (x,Bi)and there
is one covariate which enters both equations but with different coefficients and for which
the support is all of the real line. Yashin et al. (1986) and Manton, Stallard & Woodbury
(1986) use normal covariates in a competing risks model and argue the plausibility of
assuming that different causes affect the marginal distributions in different ways so the
,8i are distinct across specific causes.
Assumption (i) is a technical assumption which has to be either assumed or verified
in specific cases. In the model given by (4), assumption (i) is satisfied if

The identifiabilityof the competing risks model

The finiteness of this expectation is exactly the condition on unobservables required for
nonparametric identification of the proportional hazard model that appears in the seminal
work of Elbers & Ridder (1982).

COMPETING

RISKS IN AN ACCELERATED

MODEL

HAZARD

In this section we consider the identifiability of a competing risks version of the
accelerated hazard model. The survivor function for the accelerated hazard model is
given by
S(t Ix) = exp [ -Z{ to (x)}].

(6)

Using the same procedure as was used for the proportional hazard model, we can
introduce dependence between two potential failure times by assuming that they are
generated by solving U1= S1(T1) and U2= S2(T2), where U1 and U2 are not necessarily
independent uniform U(O, 1) random variables. If the joint distribution of U1 and U2 is
K then the joint survivor function for T1 and T2 is
S(t1, t2|x) = K (exp [ -Z1{ t, X1(x)}], exp [-Z2{t242(x)}]).

(7)

Notice that for all K the bivariate survival model (7) has marginal distributions with
accelerated hazards.
Defining
K(Nq,

m2)=

K(exp [-Z1{-log (if)}], exp [-Z2{-log

(2)}])

(8)

we can write (7) in the same form as (3):
S(t1, t2Ix) = K[exp {-Z1(t1)41(x)}, exp {-Z2(t2)42(X)}],

(9)

where Z1(t) = t and Z2(t) = t. This means that the specification (3) is general enough to
cover dependent accelerated hazard models as a special case. Under the conditions of
Theorem 1 we can identify K, 01 and 02. If it is further assumed that the marginal
distributions of K in (7) are uniform then we can also identify K, Z1 and Z2. The
uniformity of the marginal distribution of K implies that the marginal distribution of K
is given by

K(,ql, 1) = K(exp [-Z1{-log (lf)}], 1) = exp [-Z1{-log (if)}],
and hence Z1(t) = -log {K(e-', 1)} and by a similar argument Z2(t) = -log {K(1, e-t)}.
Thus the model given by (7) is identified if it is assumed that K has uniform marginal
distributions. Moreover it is clear that identification of K and of the Zi can be established
if the marginals of K are specified to be any other known distribution. Note that (3) can
be interpreted as arising from an accelerated hazard model if and only if Z1(t) and Z2(t)
are power functions.
4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
It is clear from the proof of Theorem 1 that the same line of argument can be utilized
to establish the identifiability of competing risks models with an arbitrary but known
number of risks. With only one risk, this implies that we can identify duration models
of the type
S(ft| x) = K [exp {-Z( t)1 (x)}].

The model (10) includes the proportional hazard model with unobserved heterogeneity
and the accelerated hazard model as special cases.
The analysis in this paper demonstrates how the introduction of regressors aids in the
identification of a large class of competing risks models. The Cox-Tsiatis theorem
concerning the nonidentifiability of competing risks models can be reversed if the available
covariates and underlying models satisfy the conditions of Theorem 1. Under these
conditions, it is possible to identify dependent competing risks models knowing only the
distribution of the identified minimum. Our identification theorem suggests that it will
be possible to develop a general nonparametric approach to consistent estimation in
multistate duration models.
