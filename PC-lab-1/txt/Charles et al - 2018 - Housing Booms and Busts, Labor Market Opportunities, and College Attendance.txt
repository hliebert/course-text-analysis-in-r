Housing Booms and Busts, Labor Market Opportunities,
and College Attendance†
By Kerwin Kofi Charles, Erik Hurst, and Matthew J. Notowidigdo*
We study how the recent housing boom and bust affected ­college
enrollment during the 2000s. We exploit cross-city variation in
local housing booms, which improved labor market ­opportunities
for young men and women. We find that the boom lowered ­college
­enrollment, with effects concentrated at two-year colleges.
The decline in ­enrollment during the boom was generally reversed
during the bust; however, attainment remains persistently low for
particular cohorts, suggesting that reduced educational attainment
is an enduring effect of the recent housing cycle. The housing boom
can account for approximately 25 percent of the recent slowdown in
college attainment. (JEL I23, I25, J24, J31, R21, R31)
There is an active literature studying the consequences of the national boom
and bust in housing that lasted from the late 1990s to the late 2000s, including an
­emerging body of work studying its effects on future economic growth. The ­creation
of an “overhang” of debt that dampens future spending and investment is one
­possible mechanism by which the housing cycle may have affected future growth
(Bhutta 2014; Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor 2014; Mian and Sufi 2014). Another
possibility is that the cycle could have caused labor to be misallocated toward temporarily ­booming sectors with poor long-term growth prospects.1 Curiously, how

Notes: This figure reports trends in the share of men and women (age 18–29) who have attended at least one year of
college. This series is constructed from the Current Population Survey (CPS) using CPS survey weights. The dashed
line is the predicted college attendance rates based on a quadratic trend that is fit to the 1980 –1996 period.

the boom and bust may have affected the distribution of schooling in the population
has received ­little ­attention in this literature, despite education’s key role in determining future ­individual well-being and economic growth. This paper empirically
assesses how housing demand shocks over the course of the housing cycle affected
overall college attainment in the United States and adjudicates among alternative
explanations for the patterns we document.
Suggestive evidence that the housing boom and bust changed individual ­schooling
decisions comes from recent trends in overall college attainment that have received
little attention. Using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), the two p­ anels
of Figure 1 plot, separately for men and women, the share of persons aged 18–29 who
reported ever having attended college. While the share of young adults who have ever
gone to college rose slowly and steadily since at least 1980, there was a noticeable
slowdown relative to trend, for both men and women, beginning in the late 1990s,
precisely when the national housing boom started. The ­slowdown persisted through
the peak of the national housing boom in 2006 and, despite some convergence during
the bust period after 2006, attainment among young adult men and women had not
fully reverted to trend as of 2013, years after the end of the housing cycle.
In their seminal work on the much larger slowdown in attainment that occurred
before the period we study, Goldin and Katz (2010) show educational ­attainment
by birth year cohort up through the 1975 cohort. We follow their specification and
use CPS data between 1994 and 2014 to examine college attainment for y­ ear-of-birth
­ oldin-Katz-style
cohorts from 1960 to 1990.2 The year-of-birth effects from the G
regression models are plotted in the two panels of Figure 2, which measure the
­predicted ­fraction of a birth cohort with any college training by age 25. By ­extending

These results can be interpreted as extending the Goldin and Katz (2010) results to birth cohorts after 1975,
although their measure of college training is college degree completion rather than our measure of having attended
college at all. The “second slowdown” in attainment that we focus on in this paper is much smaller than the very
large slowdown from earlier in the century identified in earlier work. We pool the 1994 to 2014 waves of the
CPS, restricting the sample to persons aged 25–54 in each year. We then estimate regressions for men and women
­separately on a dummy variable for whether the person has ever attended college on year-of-birth dummies, a
quartic in age, and normalized year fixed effects where the first and last year effect are set to zero (as in Hall 1968).

Figure 2. Fraction to Have Ever Attended College by Age 25 by Year of Birth for Men and Women Born
between 1960 and 1989
Notes: This figure reports estimated birth year (birth cohort) fixed effects in education for all men and women
born between 1960 and 1990 (inclusive). The sample is all individuals between the ages of 25 and 54 (based on
age in survey year), pooling CPS datasets between 1994 and 2014. The birth year fixed effects are recovered from
an ­estimated model that regresses an indicator for whether individual has attended any college on a fourth-degree
­polynomial in age, birth year fixed effects, and normalized year fixed effects (setting the first and last year fixed
effect equal to zero and the sum of remaining year fixed effects equal to zero). The figures reported fitted values at
age 25 using CPS survey weights. The sample is restricted to native-born men and women.

their work, we document that a “second slowdown” in ­attainment occurred ­somewhere
between the 1970 and 1980 birth cohorts. For men, after steady ­cross-cohort growth
of about 10 percentage points between the 1960 and 1970 cohorts, ­cohort-specific
attainment rates were flat for the next 10 birth cohorts, before starting to rise again. For
women, the slowdown started around the 1975 birth cohort. Growth in cohort-specific
­attainment rates for the 15 cohorts born after 1975 was about one-third the growth in
cohort-specific rates for the 15 cohorts born before 1975, with the cohorts between
1974 and 1980 ­essentially ­experiencing no growth in ­college propensity. Although
the slowdown in cohort-specific ­attainment by age 25 roughly lines up with the start
of the boom and bust, the figure also suggests that at least some of the slowdown
had nothing to do with the housing cycle since it began with cohorts that had already
turned 25 before the boom began.
Figure 3 provides an initial assessment of whether the housing boom is related
to the second slowdown in educational attainment. We combine the 1990 and 2000
Censuses with the 2005–2013 waves of the American Community Survey (ACS),
and restrict attention to persons in this sample from the 1965–1987 birth cohorts
­living in their state of birth who were between the ages of 25 and 54. We then
­compute the share of the birth cohort who attended college, separately by whether
the individual was living in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) that was in the top
tercile of the increase in housing prices between 2000 and 2006 as ­measured by the
FHFA housing price index. The figure shows no differences in college attainment
by cohort across the two groups of MSAs from the 1965 cohort through the first
several cohorts of the slowdown. However, beginning with the 1979 birth cohort,
who would have been 18 when the national boom began and thus at the cusp of
making college-going decisions, rates for persons in MSAs with especially big price
increases fell behind rates for persons from the same birth cohorts in other markets.

Price Growth
Notes: This figure reports education attainment by birth cohort for all men and women born between 1965 and 1987.
The data come from the 1990 Census, the 2000 Census, and the 2005–2013 American Community Survey (ACS).
The sample is restricted to all men and women between ages 25 and 54 in the survey year. The two lines are
­subsamples of metropolitan areas based on whether the metropolitan was in the top tercile of distribution of house
price changes between 2000 and 2006. We use FHFA house price data to compute MSA-level house price changes.
The data use Census/ACS survey weights.

The difference in the propensity to attend college grew to a full 2 percentage points
for the 1983 cohort.
The patterns in Figures 1–3 indicate that there was a slowdown in college
attainment for individuals of college-going age during the housing boom and
­
­presents the p­ ossibility that the housing boom may have reduced college attainment among both men and women. By what mechanism could this have occurred?
To answer this question, we develop a simple conceptual model of college-going
which shows that there are several different mechanisms through which a housing boom might affect educational attainment. Since these effects are not of the
same sign, and are d­ ifferentially important for different population subgroups, the
overall effect of a housing boom is theoretically ambiguous. We show, however,
that a boom will tend to lower attainment if it improves current labor market
opportunities for young adults so much that the labor market opportunity costs of
college-going (the e­ arnings they must forgo to acquire a college education instead
of working) become large enough to override any other effect of the boom that
might act in the other direction, such as changes in tuition or the loosening of
liquidity constraints (Deming and Dynarski 2010; Lovenheim 2011). Our conceptual framework shows that, all else equal, the housing boom should affect most
the students on the margin of going to college at all (e.g., getting an associate’s
degree) and have little effect on ­investment in ­bachelor’s-level training. Another
insight from our framework is that the d­ ecision to not attend college in a given
year due to a housing boom may be persistent because the time available to receive

Notes: These figures report trends in the FHFA National Home Price Index ​(1980 = 100)​, trends in the share of
population employed in construction and FIRE (finance, insurance, and real estate), trends in the Census Housing
Permits Index (​ 1980 = 100)​, and trends in total new home sales from the Survey of Construction (​ 1980 = 100)​.
The FHFA series is a weighted, repeat-sales index that measures average changes in house prices across 363
­metropolitan areas. The Census series is a building permits survey that estimates the number of new housing units
(as authorized by building permits). The Survey of Construction series measures new house sales of single-family
homes, whether or not building new homes in those areas requires a building permit. The population employment
shares are calculated from Current Population Survey and are based on all prime-age men and women (age 18–55).

the gains from college shrinks while other costs of college attendance, such as family obligations, may rise with age.
Figure 4 plots the massive changes over the housing cycle in four measures
that affect labor market opportunities for persons without college training: housing prices; housing production, as measured by new residential construction permits; total housing transactions; and employment in construction and FIRE sectors
(Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate). The increases in housing production depicted
in Figure 4 would not have been possible without a substantial growth in labor
­market opportunities in construction-related activities. Similarly, the massive surge
in the number of houses bought and sold shown in the figure must have ­necessitated
substantially greater activity in fields like real estate services, which has a large
share of non-college-educated adults. Beyond these two specific sectors, demand
for workers providing local nontradable services, like waitresses, gardeners, and
­hairdressers, has been shown to vary positively with changes in housing prices (see,
e.g., Mian and Sufi 2014). Taken together, these patterns suggest that the housing
demand changes during the boom may have substantially raised the opportunity costs
of college-going for both young adult men and women, and could ­possibly partly
explain the overall slowdown shown in Figures 1–3. Our main analysis assesses
how MSA-level local housing demand shocks during the boom and bust affected
­educational attainment and labor market conditions. We use as a proxy for local
housing demand the sum of changes in both local housing prices and ­quantities.
To account for potential measurement error and endogeneity in our proxy, we isolate
exogenous variation in local housing demand.
Our approach relies on the emerging consensus that much of the variation
in ­housing prices during the boom and bust derived from a speculative “bubble” and not from changes in standard determinants of housing values such as
income, p­ opulation, or construction costs (Shiller 2008; Mayer 2011; Sinai 2012).
Specifically, b­ uilding on the work of Ferreira and Gyourko (2011) we estimate

2952

structural breaks in the evolution in housing prices in an MSA using standard techniques from time series econometrics (Bai 1997; Bai and Perron 1998). We assume
that these “sharp breaks” are exogenous to local latent confounds, such as labor
supply shocks or u­ nobserved changes in labor demand, which are likely smoothly
incorporated into price ­changes.3 The estimated breaks are not, in fact, systematically related to pre-period levels and changes in many observable local characteristics, and we ­provide ­several pieces of evidence consistent with them being the
result of ­speculative activity. We also use the estimated timing and magnitude of
the structural break in local house prices to carry out an “event study” analysis of
employment and college attendance. The event study estimates are useful because
they confirm an “on impact” effect of a sharp change in housing demand on both
labor market outcomes and schooling decisions.
Beginning with labor market outcomes, we find that increases in housing demand
in an MSA during the 2000–2006 boom increased employment and wages for both
young adult men and women without college training, raising their ­opportunity
cost of college-going. Among young adult men, much of the improvements in labor
­market opportunity occurred in construction, whereas for young women the FIRE
sectors of finance, insurance, and real estate accounted for much of the gains. We
also find that the boom either had no effect on, or perhaps slightly lowered, the
expected future college/non-college earnings premium.
We present results for college attainment that are based on a variety of
­complementary data sources and different estimation methods. First, using data from
the Census and ACS, we relate the 2000–2006 change in an MSA in a­ ttainment among
young adults aged 18–25. Both ordinary least squares (OLS) and two-stage least
squares (2SLS) estimates show that the growth in the fraction of young adults with
any college training was lower the larger the MSA’s housing boom. Strikingly, we
find no evidence that the change in an MSA’s housing demand during the boom had
an effect on the change in the ­fraction of young adults with a bachelor’s degree. The
results suggest that improving labor market opportunities during the boom decreased
advanced schooling attainment precisely for those persons who our conceptual model
suggests should have been on the margin between obtaining associate’s-level training and not going to ­college at all. We find similar results using rich administrative
enrollment data in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS),
with ­statistically ­significantly lower growth in enrollment in two-year colleges the
larger the ­housing demand growth in the MSA, but no difference in the change in
enrollment in ­four-year, bachelor’s-degree-granting institutions over the same time.
When estimating the magnitude of the structural break in an MSA, we also
identify the precise timing (year and quarter) when the break is estimated to have
occurred. Using these two pieces of information and exploiting the annual ­frequency
of the IPEDS data, we estimate that two-year college enrollment was lower after
the ­specific year when an MSA had its structural break and was increasing in
the size of the break, and we estimate no significant effect for four-year colleges
and ­universities. We also provide “event study” estimates that show clear visual
3
Our econometric approach is similar in spirit to recent work which uses structural break techniques, such as
Card, Mas, and Rothstein (2008) on racial tipping points and the work of Lafortune, Rothstein, and Schanzenbach
(2016), which estimates sharp breaks in school finances coming from major legal reforms.

breaks from trend in two-year enrollment right around the time of the structural
break.
For our third set of education results, we obtained permission for the restricted-use
version of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97), a panel dataset
which follows a nationally representative sample of young adults who reached late
adolescence and early adulthood during the early 2000s, right around the beginning of
the national boom. With ­observations on only a few thousand individuals, this dataset
is very small compared to the Census/ACS dataset. However, the individual panel
feature of the dataset allows us to track specific individuals as they age, with exact
information about their MSA at each point of the housing cycle. This dataset allows
us to assess bias from endogenous migration, and also contains a rich set of individualand family-level controls not present in the other data sources. We find that NLSY97
respondents living in MSAs that experienced especially large housing demand shocks
were less likely to have obtained any college training at all by 2006, but did not differ
from people in other markets in their propensity to have obtained a bachelor’s degree.
We next present a set of results concerning educational attainment over the
­housing bust and over the full course of the boom and bust cycle, all of which are
consistent with predictions of our conceptual model. First, we find that the bigger
the growth in an MSA’s housing demand during the boom (and thus the larger its
decline during the bust), the larger the increase in attainment between the g­ eneration
of young adults who made their schooling decisions at the peak of the boom to
the generation of young people whose college decisions were made after the bust.
Second, we show that once the housing cycle had ended, new generations of young
adults in boom markets appear to be investing in all types of college training no
differently to young adults in those markets before the boom and bust cycle began.
These results show that the decline in educational attainment that resulted during the
housing boom was reversed during the housing bust.
Our empirical work concludes with an assessment of persistence: whether the
particular generation of young adults who obtained less schooling during the boom
reversed this pattern by obtaining more schooling during the bust as labor market
opportunities collapsed. Was the reduction in attainment we find for these particular
people during the boom merely a delay, or does their schooling reduction seem to
be permanent? The evidence from both Census/ACS and from the individual panel
NLYS97 data is that young adults who invested less in college during the nearly ten
years of the housing boom did not make up their lost college-going propensity during
the bust. While our precision is limited in both datasets, we find ­suggestive evidence
that these cohorts have experienced a sort of “educational scarring” whereby their
rates of attainment are permanently lower than would have been true had there been
no boom. Their reduced educational attainment appears to be an enduring effect of
the boom and bust cycle.
Our work is related to three distinct literatures. First, building on insights from
existing models (Mincer 1958; Becker 1964), various authors have shown that labor
market conditions affect college attainment (Betts and McFarland 1995; Black,
McKinnish, and Sanders 2005; Atkin 2016; Cascio and Narayan 2015). We extend
this literature by identifying effects for different types of colleges and universities,
and by distinguishing between permanent and temporary investment responses.
A ­second literature our work extends is the work that documents and tries to explain

2954

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

longer-term changes in educational attainment in the economy (Goldin and Katz
2010). Interestingly, while the slowdown in attainment in the early 1970s has been
studied, ours is the only paper of which we are aware that documents and offers a
partial explanation for a “second slowdown” in college-going among both men and
women starting in the mid-to-late 1990s. The third, and p­ erhaps most important body
of work the paper extends, is the literature attempting to u­ nderstand the real effects
of the recent boom and bust in housing, arguably the ­defining ­macroeconomic event
of the early twenty-first century. Our work adds ­educational a­ ttainment to the set of
real outcomes shown to have been possibly affected by the housing cycle, including
consumption, employment, defaults, political outcomes, health, and fertility (Mian,
Rao, and Sufi 2013; Mian and Sufi 2011, 2014; Mian, Sufi, and Trebbi 2010; Currie
and Tekin 2015; Lovenheim and Mumford 2013). Our results suggest that, by altering
schooling choices, housing booms may reduce aggregate human capital, potentially
reducing both labor ­productivity and employment probabilities for years to come.
I. Theoretical Overview

To motivate our empirical work, we develop a simple conceptual model that
illustrates how housing demand shocks affect college-going by exploring the
­
key considerations emphasized in existing models of human capital investment.
We highlight, in particular, the effect of shocks on potential students’ opportunity
cost of college attendance (Willis and Rosen 1979; Cameron and Taber 2004).
The potential students in our framework are young adults who have completed
the minimum required amount of schooling and now can either participate in the
labor market or attend one of the two types of colleges, ​c​, in the economy: “associate’s” colleges ​(c = A)​, or “bachelor’s” colleges ​(c = B)​. Young adults differ
in ­academic ability ​​θ​i​​​ , which is distributed smoothly over the interval ​[ 0, 1]​. As a
­college student, a young person incurs psychic costs of learning given by ​​κ​c ​​​(1 − ​​θi​​​​).
Training in a type-​B​college is inherently more difficult, and especially so for less
able students, so ​​κ​B​​ > ​κA​ ​​​. It costs ​​F​c​​​in annual fees and tuition for type-​c​ ­colleges,
and s­tudents can borrow at an interest rate of ​b.​ In any period ​t​, labor market
­participants with and without college training receive labor market income of ​​Y ​  ct​  ​​ and ​​
Y ​  0t​  ​​, respectively, which vary from one period to the next because of macroeconomic
and other shocks. The college premium in a given period for persons educated at a
Y ​  ct​  ​− ​Y ​  0t​  ​  ≥ 0​. We define the lifetime payoff
given type of college ​c​is thus ​​∏ ct​   ​​ = ​
that a person of ability ​​θ​i​​​ gets from attending a type-​c​college in period ​t​ as ​​R ​  cit ​​  (​θ​i​​)​.4
We focus on equilibria where some young adults enroll in each of the two types of
college, and others do not attend college at all.5 Figure 5 illustrates an ­equilibrium in
this case. The payoff functions for the two types of colleges are negative at the ­lowest

Figure 5. An Economic Model of College Attendance
Notes: This figure shows the equilibrium college attendance decisions for individuals as a function of their
­underlying ability. The equilibrium shows individuals making choices of whether to attend college (and, if so,
whether to attend type-A “associate’s” college or type-B “bachelor's” college). In the equilibrium, individuals sort
based on ­comparative advantage, with low-ability individuals not attending college, middle-ability i­ndividuals
attending type-A college, and high-ability individuals attending type-B college. In panel B, there is a positive
housing demand shock (housing boom), which raises income of all non-college-educated individuals by the same
amount. In the new equilibrium, there is a reduction in share of population attending type-A college but no change
in share ­attending type-B college.

levels of academic ability, with the lower intercept for the “bachelor’s” c­ olleges
­indicating the greater inherent difficulty of that type of college. The ­functions
strictly increase with ability, with the steeper slope for the “bachelor’s” function
indicating the larger marginal benefit for this type of college for individuals with
higher academic ability. Both functions eventually become positive, with the flatter “associate’s” function becoming positive at a lower level of ability ​​θ​​  A​​ than the

The effect of any shock on average college-going in the population is determined
by how the shock shifts payoff functions and thus the two threshold ability values.

If housing demand shocks increase the labor market income that a young adult
forgoes by enrolling in college in period t​,​ then, all else equal, college a­ ttendance
becomes less appealing. This is reflected in the downward shift in the payoff ­function
for both types of colleges shown in panel B of Figure 5 from increases in ​​Y  ​  0t​  ​​.
The ability threshold defining the marginal college-goer, ​​θ​​  A​​, rises, and some students who would have gone to an “associate’s” college now forgo college altogether. By contrast, a marginal “bachelor’s” student is not changed by a rise in ​​Y ​  0t​  ​.​
This result follows from the fact that a young person in our framework forgoes
the same amount in labor market income whether he attends a type-A or a type-B
school in a given period, which means that the relative attractiveness of attending
one type of college versus another does not depend on the opportunity cost, ​​Y  ​  0t​  ​​.
The two payoff f­unctions shift downward by the same amount and the t­hreshold
for “bachelor’s” c­ollege-going ​​θ​​  AB​​, is unchanged.6 Overall, the model therefore
­captures the ­intuitively appealing idea that an increase in the opportunity cost of
­college ­attendance should have a greater effect on the propensity of individuals to
pursue an associate’s degree as opposed to a bachelor’s degree. We would expect
to see these ­enrollment responses unless there were offsetting influences from the
other three effects in (1), which we discuss in the remainder of this section.
If young adults believe that a boom today will have persistent effects, a­ ffecting the
labor income of college-educated and non-college-educated persons in the future,
when today’s young adults are older, the sign of the first term in (1) will depend on
people’s beliefs about the relative size of the effect of the boom on future skilled
versus future less-skilled labor income. Only if it is expected that the boom will
increase the future labor income gap between college- and non-college-educated
­people could the first term possibly override the opportunity cost effect. Otherwise,
an expected decline in the future college earnings premium will complement and
reinforce the opportunity cost mechanism.
An effect that could, in principle, offset the negative opportunity cost ­mechanism
is if the positive shock to housing values and family wealth reduces borrowing costs
or relaxes liquidity constraints. The existing evidence of the importance of ­liquidity
constraints is mixed. Work by Cameron and Taber (2004) suggests that in the United
States most persons wishing to attend college are not liquidity c­ onstrained, which
is ­consistent with more recent work by Hilger (2014) and Bulman et al. (2016). By
contrast, Manoli and Turner (2016) find evidence that tax refunds have m
­ eaningful
effects on college enrollment, and Lovenheim (2011) finds some evidence of
increased college attendance among persons from low-income families experiencing increases in housing wealth during the boom.
As indicated by the third term in equation (1), the housing boom could also affect
the cost of college. We report in the online Appendix that tuition rose n­ ationally
during the most recent housing boom, which would be expected to reduce ­college
enrollment given existing empirical evidence (Deming and Dynarski 2010).
Although such national trends are not the focus of our analysis, changes in tuition

at a local level could play a role in our results. At a local level, the effect of housing
booms on tuition is ambiguous: if the housing boom raises average wages, this could
increase labor costs and increase tuition; on the other hand, housing booms could
reduce demand for college through the opportunity cost channel, and this could
reduce local tuition. We investigate this channel directly by estimating the effect of
housing demand shocks on average tuition at local colleges, and we find no evidence
that housing booms affect average tuition.
Overall, our empirical analysis compares the change in average outcomes
across different MSAs, and our estimates therefore capture the opportunity cost
differences between MSAs as well as any borrowing/liquidity/tuition effects.
­
Under the ­assumption that local housing booms do not meaningfully affect tuition,
then our estimates can provide a measure of relative importance of opportunity costs
­relative to borrowing/liquidity effects. In particular, if increases in housing demand
cause aggregate reductions in college enrollment, then this would imply that the
­opportunity cost mechanism was large compared to any liquidity effect the boom
might have caused.
Lastly, our conceptual framework suggests that any reductions in educational
attainment from positive housing demand shocks at a point in time could, for some
persons, represent permanent reductions rather than temporary delays. As in every
life-cycle human capital model, young adults in our conceptual model are less likely
to invest in schooling the older they get because their horizon to receive the expected
lifetime earnings premium from college training shrinks over time.7 One implication of this mechanical effect of aging is that if a share ds of the population decides
not to enroll in associate’s colleges in a given period as a result of a housing boom,
then it is unlikely that the entire mass ds will decide to enroll in a subsequent period
if there is a negative housing demand shock that is equal in size to the preceding boom. Graphically, this mechanical aging effect causes the payoff functions in
Figure 5 to shift vertically downward each period as the person ages. The upward
vertical shift in the two payoff functions caused by a housing bust would move them
to a lower intersection point than where they intersected before a preceding boom
of equal size.
Before turning to the main education results that will be interpreted using the
model in this section, we first offer direct evidence about how the opportunity cost
of and the expected future college earnings premium from attending college were
affected by local housing demand shocks.
II. Local Housing Demand Shocks

Our empirical work exploits variation across MSAs, k, in the size of the housing
demand shock that the MSA experienced during the national housing boom and bust.
Many papers in the recent literature have concluded that the housing boom during
the 2000s was caused primarily by large changes in housing demand (see, e.g.,
7
This is only one reason for the age effect in human capital models. In addition, life events like marriage, the
birth of children, infirmity of parents, consumption and expenditure commitments, and any number of similar
events are all more likely to have occurred at older ages, reducing the likelihood of college-going or indeed of any
type of human capital investment. This would be straightforward to capture in our framework by allowing the psychic costs of college attendance to vary with age as well as ability.

Shiller 2008). Furthermore, there is an emerging consensus that different MSAs in
the United States experienced different house price appreciations during the boom
primarily because of a ­combination of differences in the magnitude of changes in
local housing demand (Davidoff 2016; Ferreira and Gyourko 2011) and differences
across MSAs in the local housing ­supply elasticity (Mian and Sufi 2011).
To create a measure of local housing demand shocks, consider a log-linear model
of housing demand and housing supply. A local housing demand shock, ​Δ ​H​  D
k​  ​  ,​
­produces both a housing price and quantity change given by
D
(2)	​
Δ ​H​  D
k​  ​  = ​η​  k​  ​ Δ ​Pk​​​ + Δ ​Qk​​​  ,​

where ​​ΔP​k​​​is the change in the log of local housing prices in MSA k, η​​ ​  D
k​  ​​is the
price elasticity of housing demand, and ΔQ​
​​ k​​​is the change in log of new housing
­produced. Using the fact that existing estimates of the elasticity of housing demand
in the literature suggest that ​​η​  D
k​  ​  ≈ 1,​we create a proxy for the change in local
​​H​​​​​  D​,​as simply the sum of the log difference
housing demand over any two periods, ​​ˆ
k

in local housing prices and the log difference in new housing produced in the MSA.8
Our proxy for changes in housing demand is a function of both changes in local
housing prices (​​ΔP​k​​​) and changes in local housing supply (​​ΔQ ​k​​​). Theory says both
changes in housing prices and changes in housing supply should affect local labor
markets. Increases in housing supply can directly stimulate the local construction
industry. Increases in housing prices can stimulate local employment through either
a housing wealth effect on consumer spending or through a relaxation of liquidity
constraints (Mian and Sufi 2014). Additionally, both the housing price and ­housing
supply channels can increase the volume of housing transactions which stimulates
sectors associated with the selling and financing of housing (e.g., mortgage b­ rokers,
real estate agents, etc.). This discussion makes clear that it is theoretically ­ambiguous
whether the housing quantity effect on local labor markets is weaker or stronger than
the housing price effect on local labor markets. In our baseline specification, we
combine the two effects together into one metric, which implicitly assumes that the
labor market effects are similar. We describe evidence below which suggests that
this assumption is approximately true in our setting.
We use local housing price information from the Federal Housing Finance
Agency (FHFA) annual series on prices in FHFA metro areas. We measure local
housing supply by the number of new, privately owned housing units authorized
via permits within the market.9 We match information on building permits from the
8
The assumption of a unitary housing demand elasticity comes from taking the average of two widely-cited
estimates of the housing demand elasticity in the literature: 0.7 from Polinsky and Ellowood (1979) and 1.2 from
Houthakker and Taylor (1970). If the housing demand elasticity varies across cities, this may cause bias in our OLS
results, which assume that the housing demand elasticity is constant across cities. However, our 2SLS estimates
will account for this bias under the additional assumptions that our instrumental variable is uncorrelated with the
(unmeasured) housing demand elasticity and that our assumed demand elasticity represents the average housing
demand elasticity across cities.
9
Using building permits as a proxy for change in quantity of housing has several important limitations. One is
that housing markets are frictional and so at any given time the housing being consumed is not the same as q­ uantity of
housing available on the market. In fact, as documented in the online Appendix, we find evidence that housing booms
modestly reduce the vacancy rate, suggesting that housing booms increase h­ ousing market t­ightness. Additionally,

Permits Survey data produces 275 MSAs, which constitute our analysis sample of
local labor markets.
Figure 6 shows a positive correlation between changes in housing prices and
­housing permits, which shows the predominant role for local shocks to housing
demand during this time period. Figure 7 plots trends over time at the median, tenth
percentile, and ninetieth percentile for our local housing demand measure (the sum
of log permits and log prices in an MSA). The figure shows variation at all three
percentiles, with particularly dramatic changes at the ninetieth percentile over the
course of the boom and bust compared to changes at the median and tenth ­percentile.
Our analysis exploits this large variation across MSAs. A 100 log point change in the
housing demand measure between 2000 and 2006 corresponds to approximately the
90/10 percentile difference in the distribution of the 2000–2006 log changes across
MSAs. The standard deviation across MSAs in the 2000–2006 changes is 0.55.
Our empirical work examines how different measures of educational attainment
and labor market outcomes are affected by local housing demand shocks. A key
­problem we face is measurement error in our housing demand shock which could
lead our estimates to be attenuated. There is some unavoidable error in the dating of
the start and end of the boom in an MSA, and the information on prices and ­permits
that we use to create the measure of housing demand are only noisy ­proxies of
changes in building permits may not reflect all forms of increased housing consumption (such as renovations). As an
alternative to this proxy, we also construct change in housing supply by measuring change in total housing units in a
metropolitan area (including vacant units). As we also show in the online Appendix, we find similar results using this
alternative proxy as an instrumental variable to address bias from measurement error.

u­ nderlying housing demand. A second challenge is that changes in housing demand
in an MSA might be correlated with latent factors, such as latent amenity shocks,
other labor demand shocks, or labor supply shocks that could independently affect
education or labor market outcomes. This would cause bias of indeterminate sign
in the OLS estimates. To account for both measurement error and e­ndogeneity
­problems, we supplement our OLS analyses with 2SLS models that use exogenous
variation in local housing demand arising from s­ peculative activity.
Our strategy for isolating this exogenous variation draws upon the ­emerging
­consensus that much of the variation in housing prices, production, and ­transactions
during the national boom and bust was not the result of changes in traditional
­fundamentals like latent productivity, income, or population, but rather was the
result of factors specific to the housing market. These explanations include ­irrational
exuberance and “bubbles” or “fads” (Shiller 2009; Mayer 2011; Chinco and Mayer
2014; Glaeser and Nathanson 2014; Burnside, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo 2016),
the introduction of market products like interest-only mortgages (Barlevy and
Fisher 2010), and changes in national lending standards (Favilukis, Ludvigson,
and Van Nieuwerburgh 2010). The combination of these forces caused widespread
­speculative investment in housing assets, with dramatic increases in housing prices,
production, and sales until the bubble eventually burst.
To create our instrument, we search for sharp changes in housing prices that
occurred in the local area between the 2000 and 2006 period. We assume that
­underlying fundamentals do not change abruptly and are smoothly incorporated
into prices when they do change, and we assume that sharp breaks from trend in
a market’s quarterly housing price reflects variation that is the result of exogenous
speculative activity or other housing-specific forces, rather than unobserved changes
in fundamental factors (that are the major source of endogeneity concerns in OLS
analysis of labor market and education outcomes). Consistent with the work of

“smoothly” affect demand. By contrast, for each of the three cities in panel B, the
price series changed “sharply” at some point in the 2000s, suggesting the influence
of some factor d­ ifferent from smooth changes in fundamentals, such as the effect of
a speculative bubble.
Using the quarterly price series of each MSA between 2000:I and 2005:IV, we
estimate MSA-specific OLS regressions with a single structural break, and search

restricted to be between 2001:I and 2005:I; ​​τ​k​​​is an MSA-specific linear time trend
before the structural break; and ​​λ​k​​​is the size of the MSA-specific structural break:
the extent to which the growth rate of MSA’s quarterly house price series changed at
the break.11 This procedure follows standard practice in the time series econometrics literature for estimating structural breaks with unknown break dates (Bai 1997;
Bai and Perron 1998). For MSAs whose house prices evolved nearly log-linearly
over the 2000 to 2005 time period, our estimates of ​​λ​k​​​will be close to zero.
Our procedure for recovering an estimated structural break using equation (4)
is similar to the analysis in Ferreira and Gyourko (2011) but differs in s­everal
­important ways. First, our main analysis covers a shorter time period (2000–2006).
This is because structural breaks that occur before 2000 will not be relevant to our
first-differences analysis of changes between 2000 and 2006, which is the main time
period for most of our analysis. In metropolitan areas where Ferreira and Gyourko
(FG) estimate structural breaks before 2000, we tend to find breaks of ­negligible
magnitude. Second, we use the FHFA MSA-level house price index rather than
­estimating equation (4) with transactions-level data. As a result, we are able to
study a much larger set of metropolitan areas (275 versus 95 in FG), but at the
cost of potentially introducing composition bias (beyond what can be addressed
using a repeat-sales index like the FHFA house price index). In the online Appendix
we show that our main results are similar using the same sample of metropolitan
areas and estimated structural breaks from Ferreira and Gyourko (2011), although
with the smaller sample size the results are less precise. Additionally, we show that
our results are robust to alternative econometric procedures that allow for multiple
structural breaks (either before or after 2000) or set the estimated structural breaks
to zero if not statistically significant. Overall, we are reassured by the similarity of
our results to these different ways of constructing our structural break instrument.12
Perhaps more important are the substantive concerns about the relevance and
­economic validity of our preferred structural break instrument. We address these

The restricted range of the structural break search follows Andrews (1993), which excludes the beginning
and end of sample period.

We prefer our baseline procedure because it does not require either sequential or simultaneous estimation of
multiple structural breaks and does not require carrying out any structural break inference (either in terms of timing,
magnitude, or number of breaks). Both of these issues are known to be difficult econometric problems (Bai 1997;
Bai and Perron 1998). By contrast, our instrumental variables strategy only relies on consistently estimating the
magnitude of the structural break, and our procedure consistently estimates the magnitude of the structural break
even if the break is nonexistent.

two issues in the remainder of this section. First, regarding the relevance of the
instrument, Figure 9 shows the very strong positive relationship between the size of
an MSA’s estimated structural break and the 2000–2006 growth in h­ ousing demand
in the MSA. We conduct a variety of econometric investigations of the “­first-stage”
relationship shown in the figure, all of which confirm the visual ­
evidence.
In ­particular, the structural break strongly predicts the 2000–2006 MSA change
in housing demand after accounting for a full set of standard controls, with the
​F​-statistic on the structural break measure in these analyses always larger than 20.
The structural break also strongly predicts the housing demand change during the
2006–2012 bust period, a result that follows from the fact that the size of the boom
an MSA experienced is very strongly correlated with the size of its later housing
bust, as shown in Figure 10.
Regarding the validity of the instrument, we interpret the structural breaks
that we identify as the result of speculative activity in the local area. It is n­ atural
to ­wonder if these structural breaks are actually capturing exogenous shifts in
­speculative ­activity, or if they are instead reflecting changes in some latent c­ onfound
in the MSA. Formally, our assumption is that the structural break instruments are
orthogonal to other latent factors that would drive local labor markets and/or educational choices. To assess the plausibility of this assumption, the eight panels in
Figure 11 plot the relationship between the size of an MSA’s structural break, ​λ
​ ​k​​ ,​ and
­preexisting f­ eatures of the MSA: average housing prices in the MSA in 1990; lagged
­housing price growth in the MSA between 1990 and 1995; a­ verage employment in

the structural break does not systematically vary with any of these preexisting MSAlevel variables. Of course, these patterns do not rule out the ­possibility that the structural break is related to some latent confound, but it is r­ eassuring that ​​λ​k​​​ exhibits no
association with key preexisting observable variables that one would think are likely

Additionally, we assess validity of the instrument using County Business Patterns

employment, construction employment, and average income all change sharply
right around the time of the structural break. These results are consistent with a
sharp change in housing demand and are reported in the online Appendix.
Lastly, the four panels in Figure 12 offer some evidence that the structural breaks
indeed capture exogenous speculative activity rather than sharp changes in the
underlying factors that determine labor market or education outcomes. The first
graph relates the size of the structural break to the change in the price-to-rent ratio
in an MSA, using data on rental price information that we have calculated for each
MSA. To understand what this graph tests for, assume that there is a sudden change
in amenities, productivity, or similar latent “fundamental,” which ­
immediately
raises the desirability of living in an MSA. The current price of all housing in the
MSA, whether to own or rent, should rise discontinuously in this case. In other
words, there should be no relationship between ​​λ​k​​​ and the price-to-rent ratio in an
MSA if the break identified sudden changes in the latent fundamentals that give
rise to e­ ndogeneity concerns regarding current employment, wages, and s­ chooling.
By ­contrast, if the structural break reflects price changes from speculative ­investment

its price-to-rent ratio. This is precisely what the graph shows, suggesting that the
breaks do not reflect the changes in current amenities or productivity factors, at least
to the extent these effects show up in rents.
Additional evidence that the structural breaks represent changes from speculative
activity comes from panel B in Figure 12. In recent work, Chinco and Mayer (2014)
have carefully assembled data from transaction-level deed records to identify purchases in several large housing markets made by “out-of-town b­ uyers,” i­ndividuals
with a primary residence in one market who ­nonetheless buy a house in another
market. By examining differences between local and out-of-town buyers in exit timing and realized capital gains, they present clear evidence that out-of-town buyers
across most housing markets during the 2000s were d­ isproportionately ­misinformed
speculators. Using the data they have assembled, we analyze the 20 markets that we
can match to data on housing prices and transactions. In panel B, we find, at least
for this subsample of MSAs with available data, our structural break variable is
strongly correlated with growth in the share of buyers who are speculative out-oftown buyers.
Lastly, panels C and D use quarterly data on local housing t­ransactions from
CoreLogic/DataQuick, using the data in DeFusco et al. (2017). We use this dataset
to estimate structural break in housing transactions. Panels C and D show that the
estimated structural breaks are similar in magnitude and the structural break estimated using the product of the house prices and housing transactions is also highly
correlated with our main structural break measure that uses only prices. Since the
transactions data are only available for a small subset of the cities (80 out of 275),
we do not have a strong enough first stage to estimate 2SLS models with any of
the structural break estimates that use transactions data. As a result, we focus on
the structural break in housing prices, but we interpret the positive and significant
correlations in the panels in this figure as indicative of sharp changes in prices and

Figure 12. Variables Significantly Correlated with Structural Break Instrument
Notes: The first row in this figure reports the correlation between the structural break instrument used in the IV
specifications and the growth in the price-rent ratio and the change in the share of “out-of-town” buyers, which can
be interpreted as proxies for speculation. See text for details of the price-rent ratio calculation and the source of
the “out-of-town” buyer share. The second row of this figure reports correlation between estimated magnitude of
­structural break in housing volume (from DataQuick) and house prices (from FHFA data), as well as ­correlation

transactions going hand-in-hand, with both changes leading to changes in labor
market outcomes and opportunity costs.13
Taken together, the evidence in Figures 11 and 12 is consistent with our
­assumption that the estimated structural breaks represent exogenous variation in
housing demand arising from speculative beliefs. In some of our main results, we
will use this assumption to estimate 2SLS first-difference models of the effect of the
2000–2006 change in housing demand on the change over the same time period in
education and labor market outcomes, using the estimated structural break (­converted

See DeFusco et al. (2017) for more detail on the local housing transactions series. In addition to the ­significant
correlation between magnitude of estimated structural breaks in prices and transactions, we also find that the ­timing
of the structural breaks in prices and transactions is highly correlated, with the timing of the structural break
in transactions slightly leading the structural break in prices, which is consistent with the results and model in

to an annualized growth rate in housing prices) as an instrumental ­variable for the
change in housing demand.
Our preferred interpretation of the structural break variable is that it is a valid
instrumental variable for changes in housing demand. However, we recognize that
this is a strong assumption that may not hold exactly. As a result, we complement the
main 2SLS estimates with analysis that uses the magnitude and timing of structural
breaks to estimate difference-in-differences and “event study” regression models.
These regression models allow us to assess whether sharp changes in local ­housing
demand lead to an “on impact” change in trends in labor market outcomes and
schooling decisions. The estimates can be interpreted as the reduced-form effect
of a structural break in local house prices, which are valid whether the break is
caused entirely by speculative forces or from a combination of these forces and
other ­economic shocks (such as sharp changes in local labor demand).14
III. Changes in Opportunity Costs and Expected Lifetime Premium
from Housing Booms

In this section, we assess how young adults’ opportunity cost of (and their
expected future lifetime earnings gain from) college attendance was affected by the
boom, before turning to our main analysis studying different aspects of ­educational
attainment.
We assume that a young adult who attends college in a given year forgoes the
equivalent of the average labor market income received that year by persons in his
MSA of roughly the same age who have no college training. His best estimate of
the future lifetime premium from having gone to college is taken to be the current
mean difference in labor market outcomes between older adults in his MSA with
and without a college education.
We estimate mean labor market outcomes in an MSA from the 2000 Census and
from several years of data from the American Community Survey (ACS), using
the Integrated Public Use Microsamples (IPUMS) database (Ruggles et al. 2004).
We restrict the Census/ACS sample to non-institutionalized persons l­iving in an
MSA in their state of birth, and we exclude individuals living in group q­ uarters.
This “same state” sample restriction partially accounts for the potential c­ onfounding
effects of endogenous migration of the type shown to accompany other types of local
demand shocks (Blanchard and Katz 1992; Bound and Holzer 2000; Notowidigdo
2013). Likewise, this restriction excludes all foreign-born individuals, mitigating
the concern that our results are being driven by compositional changes in the local
area due to both international migration and the intrastate migration of immigrants
(Cadena and Kovak 2016). Using the Census/ACS samples, we explore three s­ eparate
time periods: 2000, 2006, and 2012. Averages for the year 2000 are e­ stimated using
the 2000 Census. To compute the labor market and education a­ verages in the years
14
As described in the online Appendix, we provide a full dataset of the estimated structural breaks by
­ etropolitan area, and future authors can decide whether they wish to follow the 2SLS specification and make
m
the necessary exogeneity assumption, or, alternatively, authors can use the timing and magnitude of the structural
breaks to estimate “event study” specifications. For settings where it is not important whether the structural break
is caused by speculative activity or by sharp changes in local labor demand, the difference-in-differences and event
study specifications may be preferable.

2006 and 2012, respectively, we pool ACS data from 2005 to 2007 (and refer to it as
2006) and from 2011 to 2013 (and refer to it as 2012). We pool the data in the ACS
to increase precision given that our analysis is always conducted at the level of MSA
observations.15 For the Census/ACS analysis, we cannot explore the years between
2001 and 2004 because the ACS does not provide information on the individual’s
MSA during those years; the 2000 Census includes MSA information, as does the
ACS starting in 2005.
Using the Census/ACS sample, we estimate first-difference regressions of the
form

​​​ Hk​t​​​​  D​​ + ​Xk​t​​  Γ + ​νk​ t​​​,
Δ ​​

Δ ​​​​

_
Δ ​​Hk​t​​​​  D​​​and ​Δ ​​Y​​tk​​​are, respectively, the change in housing demand (defined
where ​​ˆ
above) and the change in the average labor market conditions that proxy for
­opportunity costs and expected future lifetime college premium in MSA ​k​ between
periods ​t​and ​t + s​. The first difference specification in (4) accounts for the effect
of latent fixed MSA-specific factors. The control vector X​
​​ kt​​​ in (4) is designed to
control for any factors that could cause differential trends in labor market conditions
across MSAs. This vector includes controls for the share of employed workers with
a ­college degree, the share of women in the labor force, the fraction of the MSA
that is foreign-born, and the log of the MSA’s total population as measured in 2000.
Standard errors in all our analyses are clustered by state. Lastly, all regressions are
weighted by MSA young adult population (age 18–33) in 2000.
Since we mainly focus on the education choices of 18–25-year-olds, we use
the average labor market outcomes of non-college 18–25-year-olds to measure
­opportunity costs. This group includes all individuals with just a high school degree
(or equivalent) and high school dropouts. We measure both the employment rate
and average wages for this group, averaging across individuals in each MSA-year.
To compute individual wages, we divide the individual’s reported annual ­earnings
from the prior year by an estimate of their reported annual hours worked over the
prior year. To compute the skill premium within each MSA in each period ​t​, we
focus on the wages of 26–55-year-olds for those with and without any ­college
­education. In the language of our model outlined above, this is our estimate of the
­individual’s expected future college premium. The online Appendix provides a
­further ­description of the construction of all variables used in the paper.
Table 1 presents estimates of the effect of the housing boom on opportunity
costs, using two different measures of what a young adult gives up in terms of
labor market rewards by going to college in a given year. The table presents both
OLS and 2SLS results. Subsequent tables show only the preferred 2SLS results; all
­corresponding OLS results for all other tables are presented in the online Appendix.
We show both sets of estimates in Table 1 to give a sense of the pattern of results that
we c­ onsistently find across the relationships we study: strongly significant 2SLS
15
When computing house price growth over the boom, we examine the change between 2000 and 2006,
a­ veraging the second- and third-quarter house price index values in each of these years. For the housing supply
proxy, we calculate the change between average annual housing permits over the 2004–2006 period and average
annual housing permits over the 1998–2000 period.

to ages 18–25, have been restricted to individuals who live in same state where they were born, and excludes
­individuals in group quarters. Additionally, all individuals have no college education, which includes high school
dropouts and high school graduates with no reported college attendance. The baseline controls included in all
­columns are the following: log of MSA population in 2000, share of employed adults with a college degree, the
share of adults who are foreign born, and the share of women in the labor force. The average 18–25 ­employment rate
in 2000 is 0.61 for adults, 0.64 for men, and 0.57 for women. The share of total employment change is c­ alculated

e­ stimates that are larger than their OLS counterparts, although the latter are consistently relatively large and generally statistically significant across all of our results.
The first column of Table 1 presents the results for the average prevailing
­employment rate among young adults without a college education. Both the OLS

VOL. 108 NO. 10

2971

and 2SLS results show that 2000–2006 growth in housing demand in an MSA raised
employment among non-college-educated young adults overall, and for men and
women separately. The OLS results in panel A suggest that in an MSA ­experiencing
a 100 log point larger increase in housing demand between 2000 and 2006, the mean
employment rate was 2.8 percentage points higher among all 18–25-year-olds and
2.8 and 3.0 percentage points higher among 18–25 ­non-college men and women,
separately. The corresponding preferred 2SLS estimates are 4.8, 5.5, and 4.1 percentage points. These effects, which are all strongly s­tatistically ­significant, are
relatively large given that the mean employment rates for all n­ on-college-­educated
18-25-year-olds and for men and women separately, were 60.6, 64.3, and 56.5 percent, respectively. A one standard deviation change in h­ ousing demand across MSAs
was 0.55. As a result, our 2SLS regressions imply that a one standard deviation
change in housing demand was associated with a 3.0 and 2.3 ­percentage point
increase in employment rates for 18–25-year-old non-college men and women,
respectively.
The estimated effect on housing demand shocks on wages for these young
non-college workers are also relatively large and strongly significant. The 2SLS
results for log wage in the second column show that in an MSA experiencing a one
standard deviation increase in housing demand, young adults going to college forgo
6.0 percent more in wages, with very similar effects for young men (5.8 percent)
and young women (6.1 percent). Given the large increase in employment that the
boom caused among non-college-educated persons, as well as the effect on college
attendance, some portion of this estimated wage effect may reflect compositional
effects rather than increased returns from an hour of work. Even with this caveat,
however, both the OLS and 2SLS results for employment and wages suggest that the
boom substantially improved labor market opportunities for both young adult men
and young adult women without college educations.16 In the third column of the
table we present results for a summary measure of labor market conditions that we
use elsewhere in the paper: the product of wages and the probability of e­ mployment.
The estimates show that a one standard deviation change in housing demand results
in a 9.4 percent increase in wages adjusted by the probability of working for the
pooled sample of men and women (​0.170 × 0.55​).
Were certain sectors particularly responsible for the improved labor market
­opportunities for young men and women presented in the first three columns?
To the extent that people associate the housing boom with large increases in the
building and renovation of houses, construction probably comes naturally to mind
as a sector that ought to have been profoundly affected by the housing boom.
As ­discussed above, the boom also involved massive changes in the volume of housing ­transactions: the amount of houses bought and sold. Many persons performing
the various tasks necessary for a sale to be consummated, things like advertising,
listing, “­showing,” titling, insuring, procuring financing, etc., would have been
employed in the so-called FIRE sector of finance, insurance and real estate. Lastly,
a broad set of sectors in retail and local services likely also responded to changes
16
While we interpret the effect of housing demand shocks on employment as primarily coming from an increase
in local labor demand, we do not wish to rule out any role for labor supply shocks. However, the strong increase
in average wages is consistent with a more important role for labor demand shifts than shifts in local labor supply.

in housing demand through ­consumption increases coming from housing wealth
effects or reduction of liquidity constraints (Mian and Sufi 2014).
Columns 4 and 5 of Table 1 present estimates of the effect of housing booms on
the employment rate in the construction sector and the FIRE sector. The table shows
both the point estimates for employment changes in the two sectors, and the ratio
of those estimates divided by the overall employment effect from column 1. These
ratios measure how much of the total employment effect from housing demand
shocks for a given type of worker can be accounted for by changes in construction
employment (column 4) and changes in FIRE employment (column 5).
Focusing on the 2SLS results, our estimates show that 59.0 percent of the
­employment effect for young non-college men is concentrated in the construction
sector while only 12.7 percent of the employment effect for young non-college
women is in the construction sector. These results make intuitive sense given that
young non-college men are much more likely to work in the construction sector.
Conversely, our estimates show that 40.4 percent of the increase in employment for
young non-college women can be traced to the FIRE sector (real estate agents, mortgage brokers, etc.). The comparable number for men is only 7.6 percent.17
To assess the robustness of the main 2SLS results, we report results from
a wide range of alternative specifications in the online Appendix, focusing on
­alternative ­control variables (including splines and/or polynomials of the main
control ­variables), alternative proxies for the change in local housing demand, and
­alternative ways of constructing the structural break instrument. We also tried to
estimate whether the changes in opportunity costs were primarily driven by changes
in housing prices or by changes in housing supply, since our primary housing
demand measure ­combines them together, implicitly assuming that the employment
and wage effects are ­similar. To assess whether this is a reasonable assumption,
we carried out two exercises. First, we included both ​​ΔP​k​​​ and ​​ΔQ​k​​​ as separate
­variables in our estimation of (5) and estimated this equation via OLS since we do
not have separate instruments for each component. The coefficients on ​​ΔP​k​​​ and ​​ΔQ​k​​​
were fairly similar, suggesting that both higher housing prices and the construction
of more homes increased non-college employment and wages. Second, we explored
whether housing demand changes had differential labor market effects in areas
where housing supply is relatively elastic, using the local housing supply elasticities
estimates from Saiz (2010), interacted with both our housing demand proxy and the
structural break measure. Although our statistical precision is somewhat limited,
we find no evidence that changes in local housing demand had differential effects
in places where housing is inelastically supplied relative to places where housing
is elastically supplied. We therefore conclude that our assumption of similar labor
market effects of ​​ΔP​k​​​ and ​​ΔQ​k​​​ is a reasonable approximation that we carry through
the rest of the analysis.
We also examined the extent to which measurement error is explaining why
our 2SLS estimates are consistently larger than our OLS estimates. To do this,
17
We looked at several other sectors and found no meaningful effect of changes in local housing demand on
employment in manufacturing, mining, and utilities. We therefore conclude that the remaining employment effect
outside of construction and FIRE is accounted for by a broad range of jobs in the local retail and service sectors.
We also found no evidence of changes in local housing demand on employment in tradable sectors, which we estimate by adapting the definitions in Mian and Sufi (2014) to Census/ACS employment data.

we use the Census/ACS data to construct alternative proxies for ​​ΔP​k​​​ and ΔQ​
​​ k​​​.
In ­particular, we use change in self-reported housing value as an alternative measure
of change in housing prices and the change in the number of housing units in the
MSA as an ­alternative measure of the change in housing quantity. This ­alternative
measure can then be used as an instrumental variable instead of our preferred
­structural break instrument. Under the assumption that the measurement errors in
each of these p­ roxies is uncorrelated with the measurement error in the proxies
used in the b­ aseline analysis, then this provides a way of assessing the importance
of measurement error. These results are reported in the online Appendix and indicate that roughly one-quarter of the difference between our OLS and 2SLS estimates could be due to measurement error. The remainder of the difference could be
due either to endogeneity bias arising from unobserved shocks affecting housing
­market outcomes and labor market outcomes, or other sources of measurement error
not addressed by these alternative proxies, such as measurement error in the local
­housing demand elasticity.
The results in Table 1 show clearly that the boom substantially increased the
opportunity cost of college-going for both young men and women, although these
increases came in different sectors. Table 2 explores how the boom changed the
expected college earnings premium that a young adult could have expected to earn
in the future. We estimate this by comparing the labor market outcomes of older,
prime-aged persons (age 26–55) with and without any college education. We focus
on the same labor market outcomes in the first three columns of Table 1, but the
dependent variable is now the change over time in the difference in labor market
outcomes between those with at least one year of college education to those without
any college education.
Recall from the discussion in Section I that if housing booms raised the expected
future college/non-college labor market premium, that effect would tend to
­offset any negative response to the opportunity cost changes presented in Table 1.
The results in Table 2 argue strongly against this possibility. The 2SLS point
­estimates indicate that local housing demand shocks lowered the employment rate
gap between college and non-college working adults, strictly reducing the future
­college/non-college gain that a younger adult might reasonably have expected from
getting a college education.
The estimates in the second column show that local housing booms did not
­meaningfully change the expected future college/non-college wage gains. In ­contrast
to the employment rate results, local booms did not significantly increase or reduce
the college/non-college wage gap among older working adults, with ­estimates
­generally close to zero. The results for the future wages weighted by the ­probability
of finding employment (shown in column 3) are similar to the e­ mployment rate
results. In sum, the results in Table 2 show that a young adult during the boom years,
trying to form a conjecture of how increasing housing demand in his local area
would affect his future market returns from different education paths, would have
­reasonably concluded that the boom either had no effect on lifetime labor ­market
streams from the college versus non-college path, or else potentially reduced the
earnings and employment gain from becoming college-educated. Nothing about
expected future gain would have tended to militate against the effect of rising
­opportunity costs.

Notes: Dependent variable is 2000–2006 change in difference between any college and
no college. This table reports 2SLS estimates for alternative gender and education groups.
All ­samples are restricted to ages 26–55 and have been restricted to individuals who live in
same state where they were born and excludes individuals in group quarters. All individuals
with no college education represents high school dropouts and high school graduates with no
reported college attendance; all individuals with any college reported attending ­college for at
least part of one year (which includes college graduates and college dropouts). The ­dependent
variables are the difference in the change in labor market outcomes for those with any c­ ollege
relative to the same labor market change for those with no college. A ­negative ­coefficient
means the labor market outcomes of those with no college improved relative to those with
any college during the housing boom. The baseline controls are described in Table 1. Standard
errors are shown in parentheses and are clustered by state.

IV. Housing Demand Shocks and College Attainment during the Boom

In this section, we present the paper’s main results, which assess how local
h­ ousing demand shocks during the boom affected young adults’ college-going.
We use a variety of methods and information about college-going from three
­different data sources. Moreover, as we show below, the particular limitations of
each data source are strengths of at least one of the other two. Combining a range
of estimation ­methods and different data sources therefore allows us to carry out a
more ­comprehensive investigation.
A. Census/ACS Estimates
Our first education results use self-reports of schooling attainment in the
“same state” Census/ACS sample combining the 2000 Census and the 2006 ACS.
Our primary measure of educational attainment is the fraction of individuals in
a given age range with any college attainment regardless of degree completion.
We refer to this measure as “Any college.” Our second measure of educational
attainment is the fraction of individuals in a given age range who completed at

VOL. 108 NO. 10

CHARLES ET AL: HOUSING BOOMS AND BUSTS

2975

least a bachelor’s degree. We refer to this measure as “Bachelor’s degree or higher.”
We calculate the mean educational attainment rates in an MSA among 18–25-yearolds in 2000 and among 18–25-year-olds in 2006. We estimate first-difference
regressions of the form
​​​ Hk​t​​​​  D​​  + ​X​kt​​  Γ + ​u​kt​​  ,​
Δ ​​
(5)	​
Δ ​Sk​t​​  = ​α​0​​  + ​β​FDˆ
where ​​ΔS​kt​​​ is change in average educational attainment among 18–25-year-olds
in an MSA between periods t​​and ​t + s​. The coefficient ​​βF​ D​​​ is the first-difference
estimate of how the growth in housing demand in an MSA affected the change in
college attendance among young adults in that MSA.
Table 3 presents the 2SLS estimates using the structural break ​​
λ​k​​​
as an instrumental variable. The two columns show the results for the dependent
variable defined for “Any college” and “Bachelor’s degree or higher,” respectively.
The first three panels show the results where the education measures are defined for
all individuals in the 18–25 range, just males in this range, and just females in this
range. The last panel shows results for a specification where we look at changes in
college attainment for all 26–33-year-olds.
The results indicate that rising local housing demand during the national
­housing boom sharply lowered the fraction of 18–25-year-olds with “Any college,”
with ­estimated effects that were very similar for men and women. The strongly
­statistically significant point estimates imply that a one standard deviation increase
in local housing demand reduced the fraction of 18–25-year-olds who completed
any amount of college training by about 1 percentage point: 0.9 for men and 1.0
for women. As a benchmark, roughly 43 percent of men and 51 percent of women
between the ages of 18 and 25 had any college attainment in 2000. By contrast,
the second column in the table shows that the growth in local housing demand had
no effect on the fraction of 18–25-year-olds with at least a bachelor’s degree. It is
not only that the effects are statistically insignificant; the point estimates are small
­compared to the point estimates in column 1.
Panel D presents estimates for persons aged 26–33. The c­onceptual model
emphasizes that older households should be less likely to respond to the housing boom. The results show, reassuringly, that a sample older than our 18–25
age group of interest did not respond to the housing demand shock. Additionally,
the fact that we find no effect of housing boom on bachelor’s attainment in this
older group suggest that the null effect we find for 18–25-year-olds is not simply
because they are too young to have completed their bachelor’s degrees.
Our finding that increases in local housing demand during the national boom
lowered mean college attainment, with almost all of the effect coming from
­
­schooling that is less than a bachelor’s degree, is consistent with the predictions of
our ­conceptual model emphasizing the role of opportunity costs. The large Census
samples allow us to precisely estimate means at the start and peak of the boom for
relatively narrow birth cohorts by MSA, which is an important advantage of this
data source. However, there are some important limitations of the Census/ACS data.
One concern is that the Census/ACS education self-reports may be unreliable.
This is an especially important concern because there is some evidence that the
errors in self-reported education tend to be nonclassical, with people claiming

Notes: Dependent variable is 2000–2006 change in share with college education. This table
reports 2SLS estimates for alternative gender and age groups. All samples are restricted to ages
listed in panel heading have been restricted to individuals who live in same state where they
were born, and excluded those in group quarters. All individuals with any college reported
attending college for at least a portion of one year. The baseline ­controls are described in

higher e­ ducational attainment than is suggested by other types of evidence (see,
e.g., Fillmore 2014). A second concern is that Census/ACS data do not allow us
to ­determine whether a person with college training but who has not finished a
degree had been working toward a degree at a community college or a four-year
­university. This makes it very difficult to accurately characterize the type of c­ ollege
training received by an important part of the sample, calling into question any firm
­conclusions about the differential responses across different types of ­colleges. Third,
the fact that the 2001–2004 ACS samples do not record the MSA of ­respondents
prevents us from doing high frequency analysis that better allows us to exploit the
differential timing of the boom across MSAs. Finally, there is the important problem
that because the Census/ACS data are pooled cross-sectional samples, we cannot
definitively link people to their MSA at different points during the housing boom.
Even with our sample restricted to persons living in their state of birth, we do not
know their MSA at the start of the boom for persons who moved across MSAs within

VOL. 108 NO. 10

2977

that state during the boom. The Census/ACS results may thus still be ­confounded
by endogenous migration, even in the “same state” sample. We address this concern
with three additional exercises, which are reported in the online Appendix.
First, we use the migration information in the Census/ACS data to assess whether
the selectivity of recent migrants is systematically related to the housing boom.
We find no evidence across any of the observable characteristics in the Census/ACS
of such composition bias. While recent migrants do look different than the rest of
the local population on average, the magnitude of these differences is not related to
magnitude of the housing boom. Second, we show that our main results are robust
to restricting to individuals who have lived in the same residence for more than ten
years (and thus by construction have not moved across MSAs during the housing
boom). This sample is much more restrictive than the baseline “same state” sample,
reducing the sample size by about two-thirds. We show broadly s­ imilar results in
this restricted sample, with most of the main results somewhat larger in magnitude.
Lastly, we follow the empirical model of Lafortune, Rothstein, and Schanzenbach
(2016) and decompose our main results into a composition effect and a true “residual” effect of the housing boom, net of the estimated composition effect. As with the
“same residence” sample, we again find similar (and generally somewhat stronger)
results from this analysis. Overall, we interpret these exercises above as providing additional evidence against the existence of meaningful bias due to endogenous migration. The individual-level panel analysis in Section VC also addresses
migration concerns and confirms these results, though with somewhat less statistical
precision.
B. IPEDS Estimates
Our second source of information on educational attainment is the Integrated
Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). The IPEDS is constructed from
administrative data on enrollments reported annually by most of the colleges and
universities in the United States, including both community colleges and four-year
colleges and universities.18 The dataset tracks first-time, full-year enrollments,
enabling us to identify persons enrolling in college for the first time during the boom.
We match colleges and universities to MSAs based on street address and zip code,
and we compute MSA-specific estimates of total first-time, full-year ­enrollments
for different types of colleges and universities in each year between 1997 and 2006.
In our main analysis sample, we exclude selective colleges and universities based
on college rankings from Barron’s.19 Selective colleges and universities draw many
students from other states. Excluding these selective schools allows us to focus on
a sample of colleges and universities where a large share of students are “in-state

18
The IPEDS sample includes all colleges and universities that participate in any federal financial aid program.
Unfortunately, for-profit universities are underrepresented in IPEDS data, and they were growing fast during the
housing boom period. In principle, we should be able to capture these educational investments in Census/ACS
self-reported educational attainment variable.
19
The Barron’s ranking categories group colleges into selectivity tiers. In our main analysis sample, we exclude
the top three selectivity tiers, and in the online Appendix we show robustness to alternative sample definitions,
including using the full IPEDS sample.

students.” This is important because we want to estimate the effect of a local housing
boom on college decisions of local students.
There are several important strengths of the IPEDS data. Because the ­enrollment
data are from administrative records, they are likely less error-ridden than the
­self-reported schooling attained in the Census/ACS data. In addition, the IPEDS data
specifically report enrollment for different types of colleges separately, ­permitting
a precise characterization of the type of college training for every ­enrollment (associate’s or bachelor’s, two-year or four-year). Finally, the annual IPEDS reports
provide high frequency information about college-level training, which allows for
some econometric specifications that cannot be done with the other data sources.
For example, the IPEDS data can be used to carry out an “event study” analysis that
exploits both the timing and magnitude of the structural break in local house prices.
The main shortcoming of the IPEDS is that it is not an individual-based ­survey,
but is rather a survey of enrollments in institutions. It is not possible to measure
enrollment by birth cohort using the IPEDS, as we do with the Census/ACS. In the
empirical analysis, we assume that the enrollees are from the local market that
houses that college or university, but this will likely not be true for some portion of
enrollments if people move across MSAs for their college training.
For all of the IPEDS analysis, we use the per capita enrollment rate in the MSA,
calculated by adjusting total first-time enrollment totals by the size of the 18–25
population in the MSA, using the county population estimates from the Survey
of Epidemiology and End Results (SEER).20 The analysis focuses on the 242
MSAs with enrollment information available between 1996 and 2006 and can be
matched to housing market data. We divide IPEDS enrollments into community
college ­enrollments and four-year colleges and universities. The community c­ ollege
­category includes junior colleges and technical colleges, while the four-year colleges
and ­universities category includes all institutions that award bachelor’s degrees.
We perform two types of analysis with the IPEDS data. The first set of results
follows the analysis of the Census/ACS data and focuses on changes in average
enrollments during the 2002–2006 period relative to average enrollments in the
1996–2000 period. The primary advantage of this “long difference” specification
is it allows us to use our 2SLS specification where we instrument for the housing
demand change with our estimated structural break (​​λ​k​​​). The second set of results
exploits the higher frequency annual administrative data to examine whether the
specific timing and magnitude of the structural break instrument lines up with the
timing and magnitude of the enrollment change within each MSA.
2SLS Estimates for Changes in Per Capita Enrollment.—For our first ­analysis,
we show the results from a 2SLS estimation of a first difference model of the effect
of the 2000–2006 change in housing demand on the change in average annual
per ­capita enrollment from the 1996–2000 period (when people made e­ nrollment
­decisions before the boom began) to average annual per capita enrollment during the
­2002–2006 period (when people made decisions during the boom). We ­instrument for
20
The SEER data are available at http://www.nber.org/data/seer_u.s._county_population_data.html, and we
use the 2000 MSA definitions to aggregate counties to MSAs to come up with annual population estimates for
each MSA.

Notes: Dependent variable is the change in average annual enrollment per capita. The unit of observation is the metropolitan area, and the enrollment data come from the IPEDS dataset. The per capita estimates use 18–25-year-old
population estimates from the SEER dataset. The dependent variable is the long difference across years reported
in column headings. Each endpoint is average annual enrollment during the preceding five years. The enrollment
data are matched to metropolitan areas by county, using 2000 ­metropolitan area definitions. Two-year colleges are
defined to be any college that does not offer a four-year degree. Some ­four-year colleges may offer two-year degrees
but they will be included in columns 2 and 4. This table reports 2SLS ­estimates for alternative demographic groups.

Census/ACS results aside from the change in dependent variable.
As the first column in Table 4 shows, the 2SLS results indicate that a one s­ tandard
deviation increase in an MSA’s housing demand from 2000 to 2006 lowered the
five-year average of per capita annual enrollment in two-year colleges by about
0.7 ­percentage points. This statistically significant effect is similar for male and
female enrollment. This is broadly similar to the effect of a one standard deviation
boom on any college attendance in the Census/ACS results of about one percentage
point, although a precise comparison is difficult.21 The second column of Table 4

Comparing the IPEDS results to the implied magnitudes from the Census/ACS results is difficult for several
reasons. There is, first, the fact that the IPEDS results are based on a sample of 242 MSAs rather than 275 used in
the Census analysis. This does not guarantee that the results would be quantitatively the same even if the measures
used in the two studies were identical. A second issue that frustrates easy comparison across the two sets of results is
that we do not know the ages of enrollees in the IPEDS, whereas all of the Census/ACS results focus on ­schooling
completed by persons in particular age bins. Another important difference between the data sources that makes
comparison of the magnitudes difficult is that whereas the Census data are limited to persons born in the same state,

2980

p­ resents results for enrollment in four-year colleges. The contrast with the results
in the first column is very striking. We find that the 2000–2006 growth in housing
demand in an MSA had no statistically significant effect on per ­capital four-year
enrollment. For men, the four-year enrollment point estimates are very small, less than
one-tenth the size of the corresponding two-year enrollment ­estimate. The ­estimated
effect for women is larger but it is also imprecisely ­estimated. Given the large standard errors on the bachelor’s results, we cannot rule out whether women actually
increased their bachelor’s enrollments, perhaps because of the liquidity constraint
mechanism discussed in Section I.22
For the third and fourth columns of Table 4, we use IPEDS data from several
years before the boom to assess whether the results in the first two columns actually
capture the causal effect of housing boom, or whether the regressions might simply
be picking up the effect of preexisting trends. In these placebo tests, we measure
whether the 2000–2006 change in housing demand predicts the growth in annual
average enrollment from a previous time period: specifically the change in ­average
annual enrollment during the 1991–1996 period relative to average enrollment
during the 1987–1990 period. Reassuringly, the results show that current booms
do not ­predict previous changes in average annual per capita for either two-year
or four-year college enrollment. This suggests that the estimates in the first two
­columns are not simply capturing long-term trends and indeed capture causal effects
attributable to the housing demand shock.
How do these results compare to the 2SLS Census results for completed ­schooling
in Table 3? Although enrollment is a flow measure of schooling and the Census
highest schooling completed variable studied in Table 3 is a measure of the stock
of college training, the two constructs should offer the same basic picture of the
effect of housing booms, since the years of college that a person has completed as of
given year is necessarily a function of their enrollment decisions in several separate
years before year in question. It is therefore reassuring that the two sets of results
give the same qualitative picture of a significant negative effect of the booms on
­associate’s-level training, with much smaller effects for bachelor’s-level training.
Difference-in-Differences and Event Study Estimates for Per-Capita
Enrollments.—The second exercise we conduct with the IPEDS exploits the exogenous variation associated with the MSA-specific information about the timing and
size of ­structural breaks in a difference-in-differences (DD) model. Specifically,
using annual per ­capital enrollment in a given MSA during a given time period, ​​e​kt,​​​
we estimate

there is no information about where IPEDS enrollees are from. Thus, IPEDS results include not only enrollment
decisions of native-born persons from other states, but also immigrants. Finally, our IPEDS results are based on
first-time, full-year enrollment, from which it is impossible to translate into completion rates for different types of
schooling. Despite these challenges, we think the effect sizes for per capita enrollment rates in the IPEDS and any
college attendance from the Census/ACS are broadly consistent.
22
Because of space constraints, we show the OLS results in the online Appendix that accompanies the paper.
The OLS results show a negative but not statistically significant association between housing demand in an MSA
and enrollment in two-year colleges for both men and women, and no economically or statistically significant
­association between housing demand in an MSA and enrollment in four-year colleges.

in the years after the structural break differs from enrollment in the years before the
break, with this post-break/pre-break difference weighted by the size of the structural break. An appealing aspect of (6) is that it tests whether there is a change in
MSA enrollment that coincides with the break in housing demand. Since this DD
estimate controls flexibly for time effects and for fixed features of the MSA that
affect enrollment, the interaction term will yield unbiased estimates of our effect
of interest as long as the timing of the break is exogenous conditional on time and
MSA fixed effects.
Table 5 presents the DD results. Column 1 shows that there was a strongly
­statistically significant reduction in per capita enrollment in two-year colleges in an
MSA in the years after the MSA’s break, compared to the years before the break.
These enrollment declines occurred for both men and women. To figure out the
implied magnitudes of the point estimates in this table, we can scale the estimate
by the first-stage relationship between structural break and the change in housing
demand and the standard deviation in the housing demand measure. From this
­calculation, we conclude that an increase in structural break magnitude that ­translates
into a one standard deviation housing boom causes a decline in the average annual
enrollment in two-year colleges during the post-break period by about 0.6 percentage points (0.04 × 0.55/4.0). This percentage point decline is similar to the implied
magnitude from 2SLS first-difference estimates.
The results for per capita enrollment in four-year universities in the second
­column are very different. They show that there was no statistically significant
change in per capita enrollment in these bachelor’s-degree-granting institutions
in the years after the structural break, relative to enrollment before. Although not
­precisely e­ stimated, the point estimates in column 2 do suggest that there may have
been a modest increase in enrollment in bachelor’s-granting institutions in the years
after the structural break. This is particularly true for women. However, none of
the enrollment responses in bachelor’s-granting institutions are statistically ­different
from zero. We emphasize that this effect would be perfectly consistent with our
­conceptual framework, which argues that besides the opportunity cost ­mechanism
that is this paper’s main focus, housing booms may have eased ­liquidity constraints
for some p­ ersons. To the extent that this effect exists, bachelor’s-granting ­institutions
is precisely where one would expect to observe it, since these institutions are more
­expensive. The relatively small number of people in an MSA whose c­ ollege-going
decisions are immediately changed by increases in homeowner wealth also p­ robably
23
For this analysis, we reestimate the timing and magnitude of the structural break following same p­ rocedure as
in previous analysis, but we now allow for structural break to be anywhere between 1996:I and 2005:I (as opposed
to 2001:I to 2005:I, as was done for the analysis of 2000–2006 changes). We do this because our housing price
data go back to 1995 and we have annual enrollment data going back to 1990. Additionally, we restrict the sample
so each MSA is observed no more than 5 years before the break and 7 years after the break. Because we allow the
panel to be unbalanced and some of the estimated structural breaks occur in the 2000s, we are able to add additional
MSAs to this analysis that are not part of Table 4. To maximize sample size, we include these cities but results are
insensitive to including or excluding them since all of our regressions weight by population and these MSAs are
relatively small.

makes the effect difficult to precisely detect empirically. Why the effect, if it exists,
should be bigger for women than it is for men as the point estimates suggest
is unclear.
The DD results suggest that there were changes in MSA enrollments in the years
after a structural break in the MSA’s housing prices, and that how large that change
was varied positively with the size of the structural break used by various 2SLS
analyses. In Figure 13, we supplement these results with an “event study” ­analysis
which include indicator variables for each year relative to estimated structural break
interacted with structural break magnitude.24 These figures provide visual evidence
supporting the DD regression results; in particular, they show sharp changes in
trends in college enrollment around the time of the structural break.

24
The “event study” estimates are based on the same sample used in the DD analysis reported in Table 4.
The specification is otherwise identical to the DD specification except that the single DD coefficient is replaced with
a set of “event time” indicator variables for each year relative to the year of the estimated structural (normalizing
the year before break to be 0).

Notes: This figure reports estimates of event study regressions, which include indicator variables for each year
before and after year of estimated structural break, which the indicator scaled by the magnitude of the structural
break. The event study regression specification includes year fixed effects and metropolitan area fixed effects and
is weighted by the overall population in 1990. The structural break is allowed to be anywhere between 1995:I and
2005:I. The college enrollment data come from IPEDS and restrict to two-year colleges and universities. The population data focuses on 18–25-year-olds and are estimated using county-by-age population estimates from the Survey
of Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) dataset. The sample period in each metropolitan area is restricted to six
years before and after estimated structural break (if available). Standard errors are clustered by state.

C. Individual Panel Results from NLYS97
The third data source we use to study the effect of the boom on college ­attainment is
the restricted-use version of 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97).
This individual-level longitudinal panel dataset initially surveyed a r­ andom sample
of American youth aged 12–16 in 1997 and has followed them since.
The age range of the NLSY97 sample and the timing of the survey are ideal
for our study: at 15–19 years old in 2000, these young people would have been
­making college-going decisions right around the time of the housing boom. Because
the restricted-use NLSY97 provides information about respondents’ MSA in each

2984

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

s­urvey year, we identify exactly where a person lived at the beginning of the
housing boom, regardless of whether they moved subsequently.25 As noted, this
is ­something that is impossible to do with the individual-level Census/ACS data.
More ­generally, uniquely among our data sources, the panel nature of the NLSY97
data allows us to track outcomes for particular persons through time. The NLSY97
is also the only one of the data sources we use that includes a very rich set of ­control
variables ­
­
measuring family background and other demographic ­characteristics,
­including parental education, parental income, race, ethnicity, and the Armed Forces
Qualification Test (AFQT) score, which is often used as a proxy for cognitive ­ability
and is a strong predictor of college attendance. We include these variables as ­controls
in all specifications.
The big downside of the NLSY97 is its small sample size. After restricting NLSY97
sample to individuals with nonmissing data on employment, ­educational attainment,
and control demographic variables, the final sample is 5,362 ­individuals (2,697 men
and 2,665 women). Using this sample, we estimate a series of ­regressions relating individuals’ outcomes in 2006 to the preferred housing instrument (­structural
break in local housing prices), controlling for the rich set of demographic controls
described above.26
Table 6 presents the results. The first outcome variable, in column 1, is whether the
person is employed in 2006. We show the results for this variable because the NLSY
is the only dataset which allows us to directly assess not only whether ­people in boom
markets faced situations where labor market prospects for young, ­non-college-educated
adults in general, but whether they personally were more likely to participate in labor
market activity. The results show clearly that this was the case. We find that young
adults living just before the start of the housing boom in MSAs that subsequently
experience large increases in housing demand were more likely to be employed in
2006, with a particularly pronounced effect for young men. The coefficients imply
that a one standard deviation housing boom corresponds to an increase in the probability of being employed in 2006 by 1.7 percentage points. For men, the increase was
a strongly statistically significant 1.5 percentage points. For women, the estimate is
marginally significant and is about 2.0 percentage points. These effects represent 1.9
and 2.7 percent increases relative to mean employment rates, respectively.
Columns 2–4 of Table 6 use the available information in the NLYS97 about
schooling attainment to measure the effect of being from a housing boom market
on three measures of schooling attainment defined as of 2006: whether the person
had attended “any college,” whether they had received an associate’s degree, and
whether they had received at least a bachelor’s degree. The results show that the
effect of being from a boom MSA on having gotten “any college” training by 2006
was negative, substantial, and statistically significant. Overall, we find that adults
in MSAs that had one standard deviation larger housing boom were 2.3 ­percentage
points less likely to have attended college at all by 2006. These e­ stimates are similar
25
We use the individual’s metropolitan area of residence in 1997 and assign the housing demand change of that
MSA to the individual over the entire time period, even if that individual moves elsewhere during the sample period.
Approximately 20 percent of the sample relocates during the 1997–2006 time period.
26
To ease the interpretation of the reduced-form results, we scale all coefficients by the reciprocal of the firststage coefficient from the main 2SLS estimates so that the coefficients can be interpreted as corresponding to a
predicted unit change in housing demand.

Notes: The unit of observation is individual, and the assignment of housing demand change (between 2000 and 2006)
is based on where the individual was living in 1997 at start of the NLSY97 sample. This table reports OLS e­ stimates
for alternative demographic groups, and each column reports results for a different dependent variable. The key
independent variable is a dummy variable indicating whether the estimated structural break instrument was in
the top tercile across MSAs. The baseline controls are the same as the controls in Table 1, and the additional
­individual-level controls are the following: age, demographic indicators for black, Hispanic, mixed race, non-black;
separate indicators for father’s and mother’s education (missing, high school dropout, high school graduate, some
college, and Bachelor’s or greater), AFQT score (if available, 0 otherwise), indicator for missing AFQT score, log

for both men and women. The results for h­ aving an associate’s degree are smaller in
magnitude but still statistically significant. The point estimates in the third column
for effect of being from a housing boom MSA on bachelor’s degree attainment by
2006 are small compared to the corresponding “any college” results and not statistically different from zero. These results suggest that effect of housing boom on
schooling was concentrated among individuals would have been studying toward
(and potentially receiving) an associate’s degree in the absence of the boom.27

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

OCTOBER 2018

Because the NLSY analysis tracks individuals over time, even as they move
across MSAs, we can also look directly at endogenous migration due to the housing
boom. The final two columns of Table 6 show no statistically significant effect of the
structural break instrument on the probability of migrating between 2000 and 2006.
The sign of the coefficients are not consistent, either, with an estimated decline in
the probability of migrating to a different MSA but an increase in the probability of
migrating to a different state. Additionally, the magnitudes are smaller than the effect
on employment and college attendance, consistent with limited directed migration,
as carefully documented recently in Yagan (2017). The broad similarly between
the NLSY results and those presented earlier in the paper suggest that endogenous
migration is unlikely to be the primary explanation for the pattern of results in the
“same state” Census/ACS sample, and suggests that, despite our ignorance about
the identity of enrollees in the IPEDS data, the enrollment results primarily capture
the true causal effects of being from a housing boom market rather than the effect
of migration.
D. Discussion of College Attendance Results
­ ethods:
We find a consistent pattern of results across different data sources and m
a negative effect of local housing boom on college attainment (or college ­attendance),
with virtually all of the reduction coming from college training below the bachelor’s-degree level, and roughly similar effects for men and women.
The patterns are consistent with the “single index” conceptual model of c­ ollege
choice presented in Section I. Young adults deciding between associate’s-level
­training and labor force participation should be particularly sensitive to p­ revailing
labor market conditions for less-skilled persons, as we find. The very small
(or ­modestly positive) effect on bachelor’s-level training could stem from either
the fact that labor market conditions for young unskilled workers are ­irrelevant
to the decisions of individuals thinking of going to bachelor’s training, the larger
gains from this type of college, or because the degree to which housing booms
relieve liquidity constraints (and thus counteract the force of opportunity costs) is
­particularly important at bachelor’s-granting universities and colleges compared to
the much cheaper community colleges.
Another potential explanation for our results is the possibility the various
­estimated effects do not reflect changes in the behavior of potential students, but
rather how colleges respond over the course of a boom. In particular, we would find
the same pattern of results if, instead, it was simply easier for bachelor’s than for
associate’s colleges to expand to deal with the increase in the number of students
arising from population inflows into MSAs experiencing large booms. The best
available ­evidence about the ease with which different types of colleges can expand,
or even their differential desire to expand to accommodate interested students,
­suggests that this line of reasoning is unlikely to explain our results. Exploiting
exogenous variation in class size arising from cohort sizes Bound and Turner (2007)
make it hard to draw strong conclusions. Additionally, the online Appendix reports results using IPEDS data that
replace two-year college enrollment with degree completions awarded at two-year colleges. The point estimates
are negative but not statistically significant, and smaller in magnitude than the corresponding enrollment estimates.

VOL. 108 NO. 10

2987

show that ­two-year colleges are more supply-elastic than their bachelor’s-granting
counterparts. Consistent with this previous work, we find no evidence that changes
in housing demand affect the average cost of two-year colleges in an MSA. This
suggests that the effect of local housing demand shocks on average tuition at local
colleges is likely to be small. We therefore conclude that the effects we estimate
during the boom were the result of the decisions of potential students in response to
changes in their labor market opportunities, and not due to supply-side responses of
colleges and universities to the boom.
We conclude with a rough calculation of what share of the “slowdown” in
the share of young adults with any college attendance shown in Figure 2 can be
explained by the housing boom. Extrapolating the pre-1996 trend to 2006 ­suggests
a roughly 4 percentage point decline relative to trend for both men and w
­ omen.28
What share of this “slowdown” can be accounted for by our estimated effect of
the housing boom? To answer this, we apply our local housing boom estimates to
national housing boom. Aggregating the housing price and housing permits data, we
estimate a national change in housing demand of 0.58 between 1997 and 2006.29
Applying the 2SLS estimates in Table 3 to this national change yields a predicted
decline by 2006 of 1.16 percentage points, or approximately 25 percent of the
­aggregate “slowdown” for men and women.30 Of course, this rough calculation
requires strong assumptions. We assume that we can scale up the “local” estimates
to the national time series. This rules out the possibility of spillover effects across
cities due to the housing boom. For example, our local estimates suggest that the
housing boom resulted in increased in-migration, which suggests that local housing
booms indirectly affected other MSAs that did not experience local housing booms.
More broadly, any effect of national housing boom that is not picked up by our local
estimates will not be captured by this rough calculation. This is analogous to the
extrapolation of local labor market estimates to the national time series that is done
in the recent international trade literature (see, e.g., Autor, Dorn, and Hanson 2013).
Overall, we conclude that our estimates suggest that the housing boom may help
account for a meaningful portion of the “slowdown” in college attendance, but it
leaves a large share unexplained. Other factors such as the rising cost of college
tuition may have also played an important role during this time period.
V. Effects during Bust and Full Housing Cycle, and Persistence of Boom Effects

Our results thus far have focused on changes during the 2000–2006 national
h­ ousing boom. In this section, we study the effect of local housing demand changes
during the massive national housing “bust” shown in Figure 4, and over the
­2000–2012 interval spanning the entire boom and bust cycle. The goal of this ­section
28
The exact differences in 2006 for men and women using predictions from time series model are 4.19 and
4.27 percentage points, respectively.
29
To calculate these national changes, we use the change in the home price index and housing building permits
index between 1997 and 2006 as reported in Figure 4. We calculate a log change in house price index of 0.394 and
a log change in building permits of 0.185. Adding together gives the 0.58 used in the accounting exercise.
30
The exact percentages for men and women are 23.5 percent (= 0.58 × 0.017/4.19) and 29.9 percent
(= 0.58 × 0.022/4.27), respectively. Using either the results reported in Figure 4 or the IPEDS annual results lead
to roughly similar ­percentages of between one-quarter and one-half of the “slowdown” can be explained by the
housing boom.

2988

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

OCTOBER 2018

is to assess whether the housing boom had persistent effects on the educational
attainment of individuals. As shown in our simple theory, a housing boom when an
individual is young may have a greater effect on their human capital choice than a
corresponding housing bust when an individual is older. However, new cohorts may
respond to the housing bust in a symmetric way as prior cohorts did when the prior
cohorts experienced an equally sized housing boom.
We begin with an analysis of how changes in housing demand during these ­periods
affected the labor market opportunity costs of attending college faced by d­ ifferent
generations of young adults. Using data from the Census/ACS, we e­ stimate first
difference models relating the change in average labor market outcome among
18–25-year-olds without a college education between 2006 and 2012 (the bust), and
between 2000 and 2012 (the full cycle) to the 2000–2006 change in housing demand
in the MSA. Throughout all these analyses, our housing demand shock is defined
over the 2000–2006 period. These regressions, which we estimate by 2SLS using
the structural break as an instrument for the change in housing demand, assess how
the size of the boom an MSA experienced affected labor market conditions in the
MSA over the course of the bust, and from the beginning to end of the housing cycle.
Table 7 presents 2SLS first-difference estimates of the effect of changes
in ­housing demand on the 2006–2012 and the 2000–2012 changes in college
­attendance. Columns 1 and 2 show results for the share of 18–25-year-olds in an
MSA with “Any college” training as measured in the Census/ACS.31 Although not
precisely estimated, the point estimates suggest that young adult making schooling
­decisions during the bust were more likely to have attended college at all compared
to s­ imilarly aged people at the peak of the boom. The results indicate that by the end
of the bust, the size of the boom that an MSA had experienced during the 2000–2006
period had no effect on the share of 18–25-year-olds with “Any college” training
­compared to what had been the case for young adults in that MSA before the start
of the h­ ousing boom and bust cycle. Both of these Census results are consistent with
the conceptual framework about the effect of opportunity costs described above.
As labor ­market conditions worsened during the bust, young individuals started
going back to college.
The remaining columns of Table 7 show results for changes in per capita
­enrollment using administrative IPEDS data. Following the specification in Table 4,
the outcomes variable for the bust estimates is the difference between average
annual enrollment during 2007–2012 and the average of annual enrollment during
2002–2006. Similarly, for the results from the start of the housing cycle to the end of
the bust, the outcome variable is the difference between average annual e­ nrollment
during 2­007–2012 and the average of annual enrollment during ­
1996–2000.
The results show that enrollment in two-year colleges was higher during the
years of the bust, the bigger the size of the MSA’s preceding boom, although the
­estimates are not p­ recisely ­estimated. By the time that labor market conditions had
­essentially returned to levels seen before the start of the boom and bust cycle, annual
­enrollments were no different from what they had been in 2000, irrespective of the

31
As with all of the results from the boom period, we also find that housing demand changes has no effect on
bachelor’s degree during the bust.

size of the preceding boom. Again, this is consistent with the predictions from our
conceptual model.
The results in Table 7 are cross-generation comparisons: how one generation of
young adults compares to another generation of young adults, making decisions at a
different time and facing different labor market conditions. We study next whether
the specific generation of young adults who invested less in college during the boom
experienced persistent reductions in college training. A first piece of evidence of a
persistent effect of the housing boom and bust comes from Figure 3, which shows
that cohorts from “housing boom MSAs” who made their college-going decisions
during the years of the boom still had reduced attainment when we observe them
relative to similar persons from other markets in 2013.
While these results suggest that the effect of the decreased college investment
during the boom was not reversed during the bust, the Census/ACS data do not
track individual people over time. A stronger test of whether there is persistence in
reduced college attainment is provided by results using individual panel data from
the NLSY97, where individuals are tracked over time and where we know precisely
where the person was at the start of the boom. In Table 8, we present results for
the NLSY97 sample in 2013. The first column shows that as of 2013, people from
MSAs that had larger housing booms were still less likely to have attended c­ ollege,
with estimates that are somewhat smaller than the peak of the housing boom,
­providing suggestive evidence of very modest “catch-up.” However, the declines

Notes: The unit of observation is individual, and the assignment of housing demand change
(between 2000 and 2006) is based on where the individual was living in 1997 at start of
the NLSY97 sample. This table reports OLS estimates for alternative demographic groups,
and each column reports results for a different dependent variable. The controls and key

are still ­economically significant and suggest that the likelihood of ever attending
college has remained significantly depressed well after the housing boom ended.
Taken together, our various results across the different data sources suggests that
there was a permanent “educational scarring” for the specific group of people who
came of age during housing boom and who were from markets with especially large
booms: their college training was reduced during the boom and did not recover
during the bust. Their schooling investment stands in contrast to later generations of
young adults in markets with large housing booms, who made college investments
at rates identical to people from other markets after the bust had removed the large
changes in labor market opportunities associated with the boom. The results ­suggest
that the housing boom had a persistent effect on the human capital of younger
­individuals who experienced the boom.
VI. Economic Implications of Results

The paper begins by documenting a slowdown in college attainment for i­ ndividuals
of college age during the mid-1990s through the mid-2000s. We then show that the

housing boom can account for a part of the slowdown in college ­attainment for
young adults during this time period. An important question left largely unanswered
by this paper is what the consequences are of the persistent negative schooling
effects on individual and social welfare; this is beyond the scope of this paper. This
section discusses some of the economic implications of these results to help guide
future work.
First, the responsiveness of college attendance to the opportunity cost of college is
likely an important parameter in the design of optimal financing of higher ­education.
For example, policymakers concerned about maintaining college enrollment may
want to be particularly aggressive in increasing access to college and reducing the
financial cost of college attendance when the opportunity cost of college is high.
Currently, there is little theoretical work in studying how subsidies for college and
other forms of financial aid should respond to local labor market conditions. Future
work should tackle this problem, perhaps by drawing inspiration from other work on
social insurance policy over the business cycle (Kroft and Notowidigdo 2016; Kroft
et al. 2016; Landais, Michaillat, and Saez 2018).
Second, the consequences of our results for the affected individuals would appear
to partly depend on the magnitude of the marginal returns to additional ­schooling
for individuals on the margin of college attendance. Recent work suggests that this
­marginal return to college is very high for academically marginal students who would
seem to be fairly representative of the marginal individuals whose college-going
decisions are affected by local housing demand shocks (Zimmerman 2014). If true,
then our results suggest a “scarring” effect of the housing boom for individuals who
had the bad luck of being college-going age during the historically unprecedented
boom and bust in housing. However, this conclusion is speculative; the economic
return to community college attendance remains controversial, which means that the
welfare implications for the affected young adults remain unclear.
Lastly, the group of men and women on the margin of college attendance are
disproportionately at risk for many social problems such as teen pregnancy, crime,
and poor health. A large literature using compelling quasi-experimental research
designs has identified a causal link from education to crime, health, and fertility
(Lochner and Moretti 2004; Lleras-Muney 2005; McCrary and Royer 2011). As a
result, there are likely a range of additional social benefits from college attendance
that go beyond increased earnings and employment opportunities. Our evidence of a
persistent negative effect of the housing boom on college attendance thus raises the
possibility of additional social costs for the affected individuals extending beyond
the labor market.
VII.

In this paper, we begin by documenting the large slowdown in college attainment that occurred nationally for cohorts who were of college age during the 1990s
and early 2000s. To help assess the role of the housing boom on this slowdown,
we introduce a new instrumental variable for local housing booms using the size of
the structural break in housing prices during the early 2000s, and we argue that this
instrument primarily captures speculative activity which generates increases in local
housing demand. We use this instrument to identify the causal effect of h­ ousing

2992

demand shocks on labor market outcomes, college attendance, and ­educational
attainment.
Across several different complementary data sources and empirical strategies, we
consistently find evidence that the housing boom reduced college attendance and
educational attainment. These effects are generally similar for men and women, and
seem to be concentrated among students studying at two-year colleges toward associate’s degrees. Applying our local labor market effects nationally, we find that the
national housing boom can account for approximately 25 percent of the observed
slowdown in college-going for young men and women.
We present a simple model of college attainment during a housing boom, which
highlights the separate roles of the opportunity cost of attending college, the changing skill premium, and the potential relaxation of liquidity constraints.
Using detailed labor market data, we find that the housing boom increased the
employment and average wages of men and women without a college ­education,
raising the opportunity cost of attending college. We find no evidence the h­ ousing
boom altered the returns to going to college. This suggests that the estimated changes
in educational attainment during the housing boom are likely coming primarily
through changes in opportunity costs rather than changes in returns to education or
relaxation of liquidity constraints.
Further evidence of the role of opportunity costs comes from the housing bust
that followed the boom. We find that employment rates return roughly to pre-boom
levels following the boom and bust in housing, and two-year college attendance in
2012 returns roughly to pre-boom levels, as well. In contrast to these results, we find
evidence of persistent declines in educational attainment for birth cohorts who were
of college-going age during the boom. These results may also help ­understand why
growth has been so sluggish in the aftermath of the housing boom and bust cycle.
By forgoing schooling during the housing boom, there is a set of workers with
lower marginal products than they would have had otherwise. The lower level of
­productivity for these workers can act as a drag on aggregate labor productivity,
raising the question of whether our findings can help understand the decline in labor
productivity within the United States in the aftermath of the Great Recession.
