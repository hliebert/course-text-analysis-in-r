[Received January 2012. Final revision April 2013]
Summary. We evaluate Malawi’s main malaria prevention campaign, a nationwide insecticidetreated-net distribution scheme, in terms of its effect on infant mortality. Methodologically, evaluating such nationwide health interventions is particularly difficult. There is no contemporaneous
comparison group that has not been subject to the intervention. Moreover, common environmental trends, the availability of new drugs and a variety of other health improving measures used
at the same time imply that the often advocated before–after estimator is not a good choice. We
propose an alternative estimator that can be used if the intervention influences health through
its effect on individual health-seeking behaviour but has no other effect on the outcome. We
also suggest some plausibility checks and falsification tests to assess the validity of the identifying assumptions that we impose in applications. Using the estimator proposed we find that
Malawi’s insecticide-treated-net distribution campaign reduced all-cause child mortality by about
1 percentage point, which corresponds to about 40% of the total reduction in infant mortality
from 8.2% to 5.4% over the study period.

Introduction

With 216 million malaria cases world wide in 2010, 174 million of which were in Africa, malaria
is a major health problem in the African region. The disease caused 655000 deaths globally in
2010, of which 91% were in Africa. About 86% of worldwide malaria deaths were of children
under 5 years of age (World Health Organization, 2011). Fighting malaria is thus a key priority
for many African countries. To provide a globally co-ordinated approach to ﬁghting malaria,
the Roll-Back-Malaria Partnership was launched in 1998. With the Abuja declaration from
2000, African leaders committed themselves to halve the number of deaths caused by malaria
by 2010 (Roll-Back-Malaria Partnership, 2003). Additionally, annual international funding for
malaria control has increased signiﬁcantly over the past decade, reaching an estimated US $1.8
billion in 2010 from less than US $100 million in 2000 (World Health Organization, 2011).
It is widely acknowledged, and conﬁrmed by many randomized trials (for a review of studies
see Eisele et al. (2010)), that the regular use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) against mosquitoes
is an effective method in reducing mortality and morbidity from malaria. For this reason, one of
the cornerstones of the Abuja declaration is the goal that at least 60% of those at risk of malaria

(typically deﬁned as people who are living in areas with at least one reported Malaria case per
1000 inhabitants per year) have access to ITNs, where particular focus should be placed on
children under 5 years of age and pregnant women (Roll-Back-Malaria Partnership, 2003). To
reach this target, various countries have implemented ITN distribution schemes on a national
level. Assessing the performance of these malaria control programmes is highly relevant for
priority setting and future allocation of funding. A rigorous evaluation of these efforts in terms
of their effects on health is still missing, however. The main reason is an inherent methodological
problem. For nationwide interventions it is difﬁcult to establish what would have happened in
the absence of the intervention because there is no group of people contemporaneously in the
same country that has not been subject to the intervention.
In the economics literature, there are several ﬁeld experiments that evaluate different policies
which encourage ITN usage (e.g. Dupas (2009), Cohen and Dupas (2010) and Krezanoski et al.
(2010)). Special focus has been placed on comparing the free distribution of ITNs (fully subsidized nets) with cost sharing (charging a positive but subsidized price). In both cases, subsidies
typically come from either the state or donor organizations. Cohen and Dupas (2010) provided
a cost-effectiveness analysis suggesting that free distribution of ITNs could save more lives than
cost sharing programmes, and probably at a lower cost per life saved. Although randomized experiments are generally seen as a convincing method in evaluating the effectiveness of potential
policies that are yet not widely implemented (Duﬂo et al., 2008), this technique cannot be used
to evaluate policies that are already established and implemented on a national level.
Because of the lack of a contemporaneous comparison group the standard approach for
nationwide interventions would be to use a before–after estimator as proposed in World Health
Organization (2010). This method compares preintervention health outcomes with postintervention outcomes on the basis of the assumption that preintervention health is a good
proxy for no-intervention health. It requires that there are no other determinants of health that
changed between the two periods (Heckman et al., 1999). This is difﬁcult to argue in any application. However, in the case of health interventions, the before–after method seems particularly
implausible, especially in developing countries with bad infrastructure and strong dependence
on agriculture: countries often change several health policies at the same time, and environmental hazards such as on-going pollution of drinking water or food shortages due to bad harvests
may impose common trends in health risks.
As an alternative, Ashraf et al. (2010) proposed exploiting district level variation in ITN
distribution per capita to evaluate Zambia’s national anti-malaria campaign which started in
2003. However, differences in ITN distribution across districts are not exogenous. Using data
from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs) (http://www.measuredhs.com/) of
2001 and 2007 as well as from the national health management information system 2000–2008,
Ashraf et al. (2010) controlled for some time varying confounders as well as unobserved time
constant confounders. But the key concern in their study is differential time trends in health
that are correlated with the ITN distribution. These are likely to exist. One important reason
is that several other health programmes were launched in Zambia in 2003–2006, mainly for
human immunodeﬁciency virus, tuberculosis and health problems that predominantly affect
children. Regional coverage of these programmes was driven by similar factors to the ITN
distribution, e.g. the ease to reach the region, the availability of healthcare providers and the
density of national and international organizations that carry out these various programmes.
Hence, districts with high ITN distribution rates are also likely to use these other interventions
more intensively.
Given the drawbacks of existing approaches, we propose an alternative strategy to overcome
the methodological problems. It is based on the assumption that ITN distribution schemes

affect health only via their effect on ITN usage. This is a classical instrumental-variable-type
exclusion restriction which holds in this setting because of the design of the intervention. The
key to our approach is the result that under this assumption the total intervention effect can
be decomposed into two components: the effect of the policy on ITN usage, and the effect of
usage on health, which can then be identiﬁed by using standard approaches. We identify the
effect of the intervention on ITN usage on the basis of a conditional before–after approach.
Conditionally on all time varying determinants of ITN usage, we compare preintervention and
post-intervention ITN usage to obtain the effect of the intervention on health seeking behaviour.
We argue that, in contrast with health outcomes, ITN usage is only indirectly affected by, for
example, environmental factors such as a bad harvest that leads to food shortages, and that the
relevant determinants of ITN usage, e.g. lack of work and hence income to buy a bed net as a
result of a bad harvest, can be observed in sufﬁciently informative data. Acknowledging that this
assumption may still be controversial, though, we also present bounds on the effect of interest
that do not require this assumption. For the effect of ITN usage on health, we exploit the fact
that we observe ITN users and non-users in the same period, which allows the use of standard
approaches that are based on contemporaneous control groups. The effect is identiﬁed from
either preintervention or post-intervention data if we observe all factors that jointly determine
ITN usage and the health outcome of interest.
The usefulness of our approach crucially depends on the plausibility of the identifying
assumptions that we impose. We derive some testable implications of violations of the identifying assumptions. The plausibility checks and falsiﬁcation tests that we conduct are tailored
to a speciﬁc application but most of them are easily extendable to other nationwide health interventions. Hence, we not only provide an alternative estimation strategy but also tools to assess
its usefulness in other applications.
We apply our proposed strategy to analyse the effect of Malawi’s 2002 ITN distribution
campaign on infant mortality. We use nationally representative data from the DHSs of 2000
and 2004. Malawi was the ﬁrst country in sub-Saharan Africa to launch a nationwide ITN
distribution scheme in 2002, which served as a role model for many other countries. Our results
suggest that Malawi’s nationwide ITN distribution programme accounts for about 40% of the
total 34% reduction in all-cause infant mortality over the study period. The falsiﬁcation tests
that we propose do not provide any evidence against validity of the identifying assumptions that
we impose.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the econometric framework. Section 3 contains the empirical application. The ﬁnal section concludes. Appendices A
and B contain further details on the data and the estimations, as well as the proofs and further
details on the econometric framework.

Econometric framework

We are interested in the effect of a nationwide intervention I on an outcome variable Y . In our
application, I = 1 for children who were born after introduction of Malawi’s ITN distribution
programme in 2002, and I = 0 otherwise. As outcome variable Y we use a binary indicator which
equals 1 if, at the time of measurement, a child who was born no more than 12 months before
was no longer alive, and 0 otherwise. Using the prototypical model of the statistical evaluation
literature with a binary treatment variable I (Neyman et al., 1935; Fisher, 1935; Rubin, 1974,
1979), we denote by Y 1 the potential health outcome if exposed to the campaign (I = 1), and by

526

E. Deuchert and C. Wunsch

Y 0 the potential health outcome without the campaign (I = 0). Our parameter of interest is the
average effect for those subject to the intervention, θ ≡ E.Y 1 − Y 0 |I = 1/.
The econometric framework that we propose requires two cross-sections of data: one before
and one after the intervention. This allows measuring infant mortality rates both before and
after the intervention. We denote by T = 0 the preintervention time period, and by T = 1 the postintervention time period. For a nationwide intervention we have I = T . Therefore, the average
effect for those subject to the intervention is equal to the average effect for the population
observed after the campaign was launched at T = 1:
θ ≡ E.Y 1 − Y 0 |I = 1/ = E.Y 1 − Y 0 |T = 1/:

.1/

The fundamental methodological problem is that the no-intervention outcome Y 0 is unobserved

for the post-intervention population at T = 1 because everybody is subject to the intervention at
T = 1. We observe only Y 0 for the preintervention population at T = 0 where nobody was subject
to the intervention. A natural choice to solve this problem would be a before–after approach.
In its conventional form, it assumes that the preintervention health outcome at T = 0 can be
used as a proxy for the unobserved no-intervention health outcome in the post-intervention period. Formally this approach assumes that E.Y 0 |T = 0/ = E.Y 0 |T = 1/ (Heckman et al., 1999).
However, this assumption is often violated, especially for health outcomes because health is
affected by various interventions like the availability of new drugs as well as environmental
factors such as rainfall. In Malawi, for example, the government launched several other programmes to reduce child mortality (e.g. vitamin A supplementation and vaccination campaigns)
in the study period, making it impossible to distinguish the effect of these policies from the effect of the ITN distribution scheme with a before–after approach, even when conditioning on
observed determinants of health.
We propose an alternative strategy to estimate the effect of a nationwide health intervention. Often health outcomes are affected by individual behaviour B. In our example, ITN
usage can signiﬁcantly reduce the risk of a malaria infection because nets serve as a physical barrier to malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Many health interventions are designed to change
individual health-seeking behaviour. A national ITN distribution scheme, for example, seeks to
encourage ITN usage by providing information via mass media campaigns and by subsidizing
nets. We propose a framework that can be used if we can assume that the health intervention
affects health outcomes only via its effect on individuals’ health-seeking behaviour, which in
turn affects health. For Malawi’s ITN programme, for example, we shall argue in Section 3
that it is reasonable to assume that it only affects ITN usage, which is then expected to affect
child mortality via a reduction in malaria cases. This exclusion restriction can be formalized as
follows.
Assumption 1.
E.Y 0B / = E.Y 1B /,

B ∈ {0, 1},

denotes the potential outcome with a given behaviour B ∈ {0, 1} in case there was no
intervention, and Y 1B is the potential outcome for a person with the same behaviour B who was
exposed to the intervention. In our application, assumption means that households who either
use (B = 1) or do not use ITNs (B = 0) regardless of the intervention have the same expected
infant mortality rate. Only if behaviour changes in response to the intervention may we see a
change in average mortality rates as a result of this. Thus, there is no effect of the intervention on
health outcomes for people who do not change behaviour. Moreover, it is reasonable to assume
that there are no households that exhibit opportunistic behaviour and stop using ITNs because
of the campaign. Formally, this is a monotonicity assumption imposed on behaviour.
where Y 0B

Assumption 2.
B1  B0
where B1 denotes the potential behaviour if the person is exposed to the intervention, and B0 is
the potential behaviour if not exposed to the intervention. Assumption 2 rules out households
that switch from usage (B0 = 1) to non-usage of ITNs (B1 = 0) because of the campaign.
Together, assumptions 1 and 2 imply that any effect of the intervention on health outcomes
must come from the households that switch to using bed nets because of the intervention (B0 =
0; B1 = 1). Moreover, we would only expect mortality to be affected by the campaign if ITNs
are effective in reducing malaria. As a consequence, the overall effect of the campaign (1) has
two components: the effect of the intervention on behaviour (the change in the fraction of ITN
users), and the implied effect on the health outcome that is coming from the effect of ITN usage
on health for those households which start to use ITNs in response to the campaign (the proof
is provided in Appendix B):
E.Y 1 − Y 0 |T = 1/ = E.Y 11 − Y 10 |T = 1, B0 = 0, B1 = 1/ E.B1 − B0 |T = 1/:

.2/

The ﬁrst expectation on the right-hand side is the average effect of behaviour on the outcome—
the difference between the expected intervention outcome with .Y 11 / and without .Y 10 / ITN
usage—for those who start to use ITNs in response to the campaign (B0 = 0; B1 = 1). This
parameter is the same as the local average treatment effect, which is identiﬁed in a non-parametric
instrumental variable approach (Imbens and Angrist, 1994). In fact, the exclusion restriction 1
and monotonicity assumption 2 are also assumed in an instrumental variable approach when
interest is in the effect of behaviour B on health Y , using the intervention I as an instrument.
However, we are interested in the average effect of the intervention I, E.Y 1 − Y 0 |T = 1/, rather
than the local average treatment effect of behaviour B. Moreover, because the intervention
affects everyone in a given period, the latter is not identiﬁed without further assumptions.
The second expectation on the right-hand side of equation (2), E.B1 − B0 |T = 1/, is the average
effect of the intervention on behaviour. To identify this effect, we face the same challenge as
for identiﬁcation of the overall effect on health: no-intervention behaviour B0 is unobserved for
T = 1. However, in contrast with health, we know that there were no other policies that affected
ITN usage in the period of interest. Moreover, if we additionally observe all determinants of
ITN usage that may change between the preintervention and post-intervention periods, we can
correct for any differences between preintervention and post-intervention bed net usage that
are due to these changes rather than the campaign. Formally, this is equivalent to imposing the
following conditional before–after assumption.
Assumption 3.
E.B0 |T = 1, XB = xB / = E.B0 |T = 0, XB = xB /:
Conditionally on all relevant determinants of behaviour, XB , preintervention behaviour is a
good proxy for no-intervention behaviour of the post-intervention population. In the application
we exploit the fact that the determinants of ITN usage (e.g. income, education, health knowledge
and risk of malaria) are more easily observed than those of child mortality (see Sections 3.2 and
3.3).
For identiﬁcation of the effect of ITN usage on health, E.Y 11 − Y 10 |T = 1, B0 = 0, B1 = 1/,
approaches can be used that exploit the fact that, in a given period, we observe some households that do and some that do not use bed nets. The advantage of these methods is that,

528

E. Deuchert and C. Wunsch

in contrast with approaches that use variation over time, institutions as well as economic
and environmental conditions are the same for ITN users and non-users in the same location. In principle, different identiﬁcation approaches that exploit contemporaneous control
groups could be used. Randomized controlled trials such as those conducted in Kenya (PhillipsHoward et al., 2003), Ghana (Binka et al., 1996) or Burkina Faso (Habluetzel et al., 1997)
would be ideal but are not available for Malawi. Therefore, we need to account for the fact
that people who use ITNs systematically differ from people who do not use bed nets (e.g.
because they are more educated about health risks or because they live in regions with higher
risks of malaria). The DHSs that we use contain a wealth of information about potential
determinants of ITN usage. Therefore, we base identiﬁcation on the ability to control for all
confounding variables XY that jointly determine behaviour and the health outcome of interest. Under this so-called conditional independence or unconfoundedness assumption (Rubin,
1974), potential outcomes are independent of behaviour conditional on these confounding
variables.
Assumption 4.
Y 11 , Y 10 ⊥B|XY :
Conditional independence is assumed in many empirical applications that rely on observational data and use, for example, propensity score matching estimators (e.g. Huber et al. (2011)
in health economics). It is equivalent to the assumption of no omitted variable bias underlying
an ordinary least squares regression of child mortality on ITN usage. To make this assumption
credible, a rich data set is needed that includes all relevant confounding variables. Moreover, for
any given combination of the covariates XY we need to observe some households that do and
some that do not use ITNs. In other words, there must be overlap in the covariate distributions
of ITN users and non-users. This so-called common support assumption can be formalized as
follows.
Assumption 5.
0 < p1 .xY / ≡ Pr.B = 1|T = 1, XY = xY / < 1:
If the conditional probability of using a bed net, p1 .xY / ≡ Pr.B = 1|T = 1, XY = xY /, equals 1
for a certain combination of covariates XY = xY , then everyone with these characteristics uses
a bed net with certainty. This implies that there is no household with the same characteristics
that does not use a bed net. Hence, there is no comparable observation in the data that can be
used to construct the counterfactual outcome of interest for this type of household. Similarly,
if p1 .xY / = 0, then no households of this type use ITNs, making it impossible to estimate their
counterfactual outcome under ITN usage. Types of households for which assumption 5 does
not hold need to be excluded from the estimation. This is problematic if a large number of
observations is affected, because it changes the population for which the effect is estimated. As
we show in Section 3.4, this is not so in our application.
Integrating over the distribution of the relevant covariates X ≡ XB ∩ XY in the post-intervention
sample, the effect of interest is non-parametrically identiﬁed from observed objects if we impose
assumptions 1–5:

E.Y 1 − Y 0 |T = 1/ = {E.Y |T = 1, B = 1, X = x/ − E.Y |T = 1, B = 0, X = x/}
× {E.B|T = 1, X = x/ − E.B|T = 0, X = x/} f.x|T = 1/ dx:

The formal proof is provided in Appendix B. There, we also show that this quantity can be
estimated on the basis of the idea of inverse probability weighting (e.g. Wooldridge (2007))

N1 denotes post-intervention sample size; b1i indicates ITN usage of individual i in the postintervention period; p̂1 .·/ is the predicted probability of ITN usage in the post-intervention
period as a function of characteristics x1i ; p̂0 .·/ is the corresponding probability in the preintervention period; y1i indicates the health outcome of interest (1 if the child is no longer alive
at the time of the survey; 0 otherwise). Without the last term in curly brackets, our estimator
would be the standard inverse probability weighting estimator (Wooldridge, 2007) for the average
effect of ITN usage on infant death (in the post-intervention period, T = 1). The outcome of
households with a bed net (b1i = 1) is weighted by the inverse of the predicted probability of
using a bed net, p̂1 .x1i /, to account for selection into ITN usage, i.e. for the fact that they are a
selective subsample of the average population: the reweighted sample of ITN users has the same
average characteristics x as the population of interest. Equivalently, the outcome of households
without a bed net (b1i = 0; 1 − b1i = 1) is weighted by the inverse of the predicted probability
of not using a bed net, 1 − p̂1 .x1i /, to account for selection into ITN non-usage. The last term
in curly brackets, p̂1 .x1i / − p̂0 .x1i /, measures the change in behaviour that is induced by the
intervention. It is the effect of the ITN distribution scheme on the probability of ITN usage for
household i, where conditioning on x1i takes out any effect of time variation in the determinants
of ITN usage. Equation (4) can be estimated by using the following four-step procedure.
Step 1: to obtain p̂0 .x1i /, estimate a probit model (a standard maximum likelihood procedure) in the preintervention data with an indicator for ITN usage as dependent variable
and all time constant or time varying determinants of ITN usage that are correlated with
child mortality as explanatory variables. Use the estimated coefﬁcients to calculate p̂0 .x1i /
for all individuals in the post-intervention data.
Step 2: equivalently, to obtain p̂1 .x1i /, estimate a probit model in the post-intervention
data with an indicator for ITN usage as dependent variable and the same explanatory
variables. Use the estimated coefﬁcients to calculate p̂1 .x1i / for all individuals in the postintervention data.
Step 3: ensure that ITN users and non-users are comparable in all relevant characteristics
(common support) by discarding all ITN users or non-users in the post-intervention data
for whom there is respectively no ITN non-user or user with a comparable value of p̂1 .x1i /.
Step 4: calculate θ̂ from equation (4) using the calculated values for p̂0 .x1i / and p̂1 .x1i /
as well as individual data on ITN usage and infant mortality.
Newey (1984) developed a procedure to derive the asymptotic distribution of estimators of
this type. It requires imposing a set of regularity conditions which are considered to be weak
(see Newey (1984)). Applying this approach, √
we show in Appendix B that our estimator is
consistent and converges at the standard rate N to a normal distribution (e.g. like ordinary
least squares).

Empirical application

The estimator proposed is used to evaluate Malawi’s ITN distribution scheme. Malaria is one
of the major public health problems in Malawi, accounting for about 40% of all hospital deaths

530

E. Deuchert and C. Wunsch

among children under the age of 5 years (National Statistical Ofﬁce and Opinion Research
Corporation Macro, 2005). In 1998, the Government of Malawi launched a pilot social marketing programme to distribute ITNs in the Blantyre district. In 2002, the programme expanded to
become the ﬁrst national ITN programme in sub-Saharan Africa. The distribution scheme has
three components: pregnant women and children under 5 years old can obtain highly subsidized
ITNs ($0.33 per net) through clinics at which health staff retain 20% as an incentive to sell nets.
Rural families can buy nets at a cost of $0.66 from village health committees, non-governmental
organizations and community level health personnel. The general population (mostly in urban
areas) can obtain unsubsidized nets from the commercial sector at a cost of $3.86–5.20 per net
(President’s Malaria Initiative, 2007).
Over the period 2000–2004, bed net usage in Malawi increased from 13.1% to 41.9%. Yet,
despite improvements in the coverage of bed nets, the effectiveness of the distribution programme
in terms of averted malaria cases has been unclear because no decline in malaria cases and
deaths reported to the World Health Organization was observed (World Health Organization,
2010). The public malaria surveillance system, however, is likely to be imprecise. Breman and
Holloway (2007) argued that less than 10% of the worldwide malaria cases and deaths are being reported. Nationally representative data provided by the DHS show that all-cause infant
mortality decreased by 26% from 10.3% in 2000 to 7.6% in 2004 (National Statistical Ofﬁce
and Opinion Research Corporation Macro, 2001, 2005). The DHS, however, does not provide
information on the cause of death. It remains thus unclear to what extent the ITN distribution programme has contributed to this sharp decline, in particular since the Government of
Malawi has also launched several other programmes to reduce child mortality, such as vitamin
A supplementation and vaccination campaigns in the same period.
3.1. Data
We use the 2000 and 2004 waves from Malawi’s DHS. They are nationally representative
household surveys which systematically cluster from a list of enumeration areas deﬁned in the
1998 Malawian census of population and housing (560 clusters in 2000; 522 clusters in 2004).
Clusters were not identical in both surveys. Geographic location of each cluster is provided
by global positioning system codes. From the list of eligible clusters, a sample of households
is drawn (14 213 households in 2000 and 15 091 households in 2004). All women aged 15–49
years in the selected households were eligible for the individual interview. We exclude households from the Blantyre district as it was subject to the intervention already before 2000 but
there are not enough observations to exploit this for identiﬁcation in a difference-in-differences
framework.
We are interested in the effects of the ITN distribution programme on health in 2004.
Unfortunately, the data do not contain direct information on malaria infections. There is some
information on malaria-related symptoms such as fever and on whether malaria treatment
has been received. However, these variables are unsuitable for measuring causal effects for the
following reasons.
(a) Malaria-related symptoms are captured only if they occurred in the 2 weeks preceding the
interview. The interviews were conducted between September and January 2004, which
is the season where malaria cases are low. Thus, the probability that symptoms like fever
are caused by malaria is low and we miss most of the potential effects of the intervention.
(b) Symptoms are measured only for surviving household members. If the intervention affects
survival, then we cannot measure the causal effect on symptoms because we cannot correct
for selection related to survival.

531

(c) Malaria treatment is measured only if fever in the previous 2 weeks is reported. Hence,
there is selection into survival, into having fever and into being diagnosed with malaria
which we cannot capture.
For these reasons we focus on all-cause mortality as the health outcome of interest. Since
young children are the group that is most at risk of dying from malaria, we additionally
restrict the analysis to this group. This also allows us to compare our results with existing evidence on the effect of ITN coverage on child mortality from randomized trials (Binka et al., 1996;
Habluetzel et al., 1997; Phillips-Howard et al., 2003) and longitudinal data (Fegan et al., 2007).
We consider only children born in the year preceding the interview for the following reasons.
(a) Earlier births have not been (fully) exposed to the national ITN distribution scheme that
was launched in 2002.
(b) Pregnant women and infants are the main target group of the campaign, making them
most interesting from a policy perspective. Moreover, they face the same ITN price due
to the subsidy which holds a key determinant of ITN usage constant.
(c) Information on individual and household characteristics is not available retrospectively
and represents only the current status.
(d) There may be considerable recall bias regarding birth weight etc. for earlier births. The
sample that we use comprises 2766 children in 2000 and 2523 children in 2004.
The individual questionnaires cover various areas, including a wide range of individual background and household characteristics, as well as reproductive history. The latter is used to
construct infant mortality. All households are asked whether they own a bed net. In 2000, 18%
of children in the sample live in households with a bed net compared with 49% in 2004. Unfortunately, there is no information on ITN usage for all children in our sample. The only information
that we have is whether surviving infants slept under a bed net in the night before the interview.
Thus, usage information is missing based on the outcome of interest, which makes it unusable.
Therefore, we use the information whether the household owns a bed net as a proxy for the
relevant health-seeking behaviour. We address this issue in more detail in Section 3.3.
All-cause infant mortality in our sample decreased from 8.2% in 2000 to 5.4% in 2004. In both
surveys, mortality is higher among children who were born into households without a bed net
compared with children who were born into households with a bed net (8.4% versus 7.3% in 2000;
6.4% versus 4.4% in 2004). Regarding the determinants of ITN ownership, Table 1 shows that
the 2000 and 2004 samples are comparable in many dimensions. However, larger differences can
be found for birth size, health knowledge and access to healthcare, which resemble the positive
developments taking place in Malawi due to several other health interventions in the same
period. Improvements in female education explain the larger differences in mother’s education
and wealth. Finally, there are also larger differences in regional characteristics. These occur
because our data are from a repeated cross-sectional survey that is based on a two-stage cluster
design. In the ﬁrst stage, the enumeration areas are drawn. Hence, clusters of each wave are not
identical and regional characteristics may not be identical.
3.2. Selection of control variables
To identify the two components of the overall effect of the ITN distribution scheme we need to
control for several confounding variables. For the effect of the ITN distribution scheme on bed
net usage we must control for all time varying predictors of bed net usage. For the effect of ITN
usage on child mortality we must control for all joint determinants of child mortality and bed net
usage. In what follows, we discuss potential confounders on the basis of theoretical considera-

tions and empirical evidence, and explain how we capture them with our data. In Section 3.3, we
investigate the issue of potentially omitted factors that may bias our estimates. As a preview of
results, we do not ﬁnd evidence against the validity of the identifying assumptions that we impose.
3.2.1. Socio-economic status
Economic theory predicts that socio-economic status is one of the most important factors
for health-seeking behaviour and health outcomes (Grossman, 1972). This is conﬁrmed by
empirical evidence showing that household wealth is strongly associated with net purchase and
usage (Dupas, 2009) as well as child morbidity and mortality (Omariba et al., 2007; Minujin
and Delamonica, 2003). We capture the socio-economic status by a wealth index, which is a
linear combination of indicator variables for the possession of certain household items. Indicator weights are based on a principal component analysis (Rutstein and Johnson, 2004). A
complication arises when using this index here. Neither the household items nor the indicator
weights are identical in the two waves. Therefore, the DHS wealth indices are not comparable. We re-estimate the wealth index by using the following household items which are common to both waves: electricity, radio, television, bicycle, motorcycle, car, type of toilet, type of
water supply, type of house ﬂoor and type of cooking material. The correlation coefﬁcient
between the predicted wealth index and the original index is 0.84 for wave 1 and 0.96 for
wave 2. Unfortunately, the data do not provide direct information on income. However, besides
the wealth index we include mother’s employment status and parental education, which should
capture most of the relevant variation.

3.2.2. Regional characteristics
Different risk proﬁles (e.g. because a disease is heavily locally concentrated) may not be a
relevant factor for child mortality but may also explain why some people are more likely to
engage in health prevention (Geoffard and Philipson, 1996). Malaria is strongly associated with
the distance to the next standing water body (Noor et al., 2008) and with altitude (Bodker
et al., 2003). We include altitude of the respective cluster as well as the distance to one of the
major lakes (Lake Malawi, Lake Malombe or Lake Chilwa) which is estimated from global
positioning system information as proxy variables for the risk of malaria. The major lakes and
their neighbouring marshes are the main breeding areas of mosquitoes. However, these do not
proxy for the risk that is imposed by ponds and marshes that arise during the rainy season or
the existence of permanent wetlands or swamps elsewhere. Yet, this will be captured by regional
ﬁxed effects. Other regional characteristics such as region, urban or rural area and the distance
to the next district capital are included to measure barriers to healthcare and as proxies for the
potential availability of and access to bed nets.
3.2.3. Child characteristics
We observe twin birth, gender, size at birth and place of delivery. Although these factors are
clearly likely to affect infant mortality directly, they are also likely to affect health-related
behaviour such as bed net usage: on the one hand, adverse conditions at birth might have
raised the awareness for potential health risks as well as how much the parents worry and care
for the child. On the other hand, contact with health providers at birth may have increased
the knowledge about health risks and their prevention. Moreover, Malawi’s distribution system
imposes a price discrimination, where children can obtain highly subsidized bed nets from their
healthcare provider. We therefore expect that children who were born in a health facility are
more likely to sleep below nets. Finally, the place of birth is also an important determinant of
infant mortality, as the severity of birth complications can vary with the place of delivery. From
the date of birth and the date of the interview, we also construct age at the time of the interview
and use this as control variable. Note that age is hypothetical for children who died before the
interview took place. We use this variable to control for differences in the time since birth when
we measure infant death at the time of the interview because we implicitly allow for a longer
period in which the event of interest can occur the more time has elapsed. Furthermore, more
time for potential contacts with healthcare facilities and acquisition of health knowledge as well
as longer potential experience with child raising may also affect the health-seeking behaviour.
3.2.4. Mother’s characteristics
The education of the mother is a relevant factor for ITN usage (Belay and Deressa, 2008;
Pettifor et al., 2008) and health outcomes of children (Iram and Butt, 2008; Omariba et al.,
2007). Reasons are that education increases efﬁciency in producing child health, shapes the
mother’s preferences and raises income (Schultz, 1984). Additionally, maternal health knowledge seems particularly important (Kovsted et al., 2002; Glewwe, 1999). A study that was
conducted in Guinea-Bissau, for example, ﬁnds a strong and positive effect of health knowledge
(measured by knowing malaria transmission modes and preventive actions) on child health and
survival that exceeded the effects of the mother’s education (Kovsted et al., 2002). We capture
these factors by controlling for the mother’s education, health knowledge measured by knowledge on dehydration and whether a family planning worker visited the family in the previous
12 months. We furthermore control for barriers that prevent women from accessing healthcare
which may also be associated with child mortality and bed net usage. We include self-reported
barriers to accessing healthcare like needing permission, transport or money, as well as not

536

E. Deuchert and C. Wunsch

wanting to go alone and worries about the gender of the physician. As additional controls we
use the number of children who were ever born and whether older children had died in the past.
This captures experience with child raising and child-speciﬁc illnesses and may raise a mother’s
awareness of health issues. Further control variables are the age, marital status, labour market
status, ethnicity, religion and long-term health (measured by mother’s height) that are included
to measure other aspects of knowledge, cultural background, preferences and behaviour.
3.2.5. Partner’s characteristics
In addition to the mother’s characteristics, her partner’s characteristics may be associated with
bed net ownership and mortality for similar reasons. The DHS is less informative regarding
fathers. Here, we include whether there is a partner, his age and education. The last captures
variation in both health knowledge and earnings potential.
A further issue is that different pricing schemes are the key part of the health intervention that
we seek to evaluate. From standard economic theory we know that the demand for any good
should be price elastic. This is conﬁrmed by empirical studies showing that the demand for bed
nets is sensitive to the price (Dupas, 2009). However, we do not need to include information on
prices as control variables, since all children in our sample are exposed to the same policy (market prices in 2000; provision of highly subsidized ITNs through clinics in 2004). Nevertheless,
families may have different access to subsidized nets. This is captured by regional variables (such
as the distance to the next district capital, urban or rural area and the distance to the next city),
individual barriers that prevent women from obtaining medical care and the place of delivery
of the child (at home or in a healthcare facility).
3.3. Plausibility of the identification strategy
In what follows we present plausibility checks and falsiﬁcation tests to assess the validity of our
identifying assumptions. By deﬁnition, identifying assumptions are not individually testable.
However, we derive and empirically assess several testable implications of joint violations of
two or more of the assumptions that we impose to obtain identiﬁcation.
Identiﬁcation of the effect of bed net usage on child mortality requires that we observe—at a
given point in time—all joint determinants of bed net usage and child mortality. In the previous
section we argued that we observe the main determinants of health and health-seeking behaviour.
One may be worried, though, that we do not directly observe actual health of the children and
all other household members, actual healthcare utilization or income. Note, however, that all of
this should be highly correlated with the observed variables, in particular with the determinants
of socio-economic status and the information on access to healthcare. Therefore, on the basis
of the classical arguments for using proxy variables, the variables that we include as control
variables should pick up most of the relevant confounding correlations such that any potentially
remaining omitted variable bias should be negligible (see Lechner and Wunsch (2011)). To
provide support for this argument, we estimate the effect of bed net ownership (as a proxy for
unobserved ITN usage, see Section 3.1) on child mortality and compare this estimate with the
results from various randomized controlled trials. In these trials, randomization ensures that
ITN ownership is unrelated to infant mortality. If we obtain results that are very similar to the
experimental estimates, which are considered to be unbiased, this suggests that our estimates
do not suffer from omitted variable bias.
To estimate the effect of bed net ownership on child mortality we apply the inverse probability
weighting estimator that is given by equation (4) without the last term in curly brackets. As
control variables we use those described in Section 3.2 (see Table 6 in Appendix B for the exact
speciﬁcation). We ﬁnd that bed net ownership reduced infant mortality by 2.3 percentage points

†The outcome is available for surviving children only (2540 in 2000; 2387 in 2004). Row 1 is estimated for bed net
owners only (495 in 2000; 1238 in 2004) by using a conditional before–after estimator that is implemented as an
inverse probability weighting estimator. Here preintervention outcomes are weighted by

weighting estimator that is given by formula (4) without the last term in curly brackets. Rows 5–8 are estimated
by using our proposed estimator. Bootstrap standard errors and conﬁdence levels are based on 1999 replications.

(see row 1 of Table 2) which is consistent with evidence from randomized controlled trials. For
Western Kenya, Phillips-Howard et al. (2003) found an effect of 3 percentage points for infants
aged 1–11 months. Our somewhat smaller effect can be explained by the fact that we also include
older infants (aged 12 months) for whom Phillips-Howard et al. (2003) reported smaller effects.
Our estimate is also consistent with the results from randomized trials in Ghana (Binka et al.,
1996) and Burkina Faso (Habluetzel et al., 1997). They report results for older children (aged
6–59 months) only but these are very similar to those reported by Phillips-Howard et al. (2003)
for similar age groups. The fact that we obtain results that are very similar to the experimental
estimates suggests that our results do not suffer from quantitatively important omitted variable
bias.
To identify the effect of Malawi’s ITN distribution campaign on ITN usage, we need to
observe all determinants of ITN usage other than the campaign itself that may have changed
between 2000 and 2004. We do capture important parts of this by observing the main determinants of ITN usage discussed above at the two points in time. However, for a given geographical location, we do not directly observe changes in the number of healthcare facilities
or improvements in their quality, or trends in malaria risk due to weather and climate conditions. For example, in 2001–2002 Malawi experienced a severe drought (United Nations, 2007)
which should reduce the risk of malaria and hence ITN usage due to drying out of standing water bodies, which are the main breeding areas for mosquitoes. To address this issue, we
derive bounds on the average effect of Malawi’s ITN distribution campaign that can be obtained
without imposing the assumption that we observe all time varying determinants of ITN usage
(assumption 3).
In Section 2, equation (2), we have shown that the exclusion restriction 1 and a monotonicity
assumption 2 allow rewriting the effect of interest as the product of the effect of ITN usage on
infant mortality and the effect of the campaign on ITN usage. Assumption 3 is required only

538

E. Deuchert and C. Wunsch

for identiﬁcation of the latter. To derive bounds on this effect we exploit, ﬁrstly, that the ITN
usage rate is naturally bounded between 0 and 1. Secondly, the monotonicity assumption 2 rules
out a negative effect of the campaign on ITN usage: nobody stops using ITNs in response to
the programme. This implies that the lower bound on the effect of the campaign on ITN usage
is 0, and that the upper bound is the difference between the maximum usage rate, i.e. 1, and
the ITN usage rate in 2000, which is 0.179 in our estimation sample, yielding an upper bound
of 0.821. On the basis of assumptions 4 and 5 the effect of ITN usage on infant mortality has
been estimated to be −0.0228 in row 1 of Table 2. Multiplying this with the upper and lower
bounds of the effect of the campaign on ITN usage yields an upper bound on the effect of the
campaign on infant mortality of 0, and a lower bound of −0.0187. Validity of the assumption
that we observe all time varying determinants of ITN usage 3 cannot be rejected as long as the
estimate that we obtain with our approach lies within these bounds. In Section 3.4, where we
present our results, we show that this is indeed so.
The exclusion restriction requires that the campaign affects health only via bed net usage but
should have no other effect. Thus, households who either use or do not use bed nets irrespectively of the campaign should experience the same number of infant deaths. One problem in
our application is that we observe only ITN ownership but not ITN usage for the children in
our sample. Since the campaign may also improve health knowledge, there may be effects on
health even without changes in ITN ownership because ITNs may be used more often or more
effectively. There are two ways to assess whether this is important.
The ﬁrst check exploits the fact that more frequent or more effective use of bed nets due to
the intervention should improve the effect of net ownership on infant mortality. We estimate this
effect for the post-intervention (T = 1) and the preintervention period (T = 0) and test for zero
difference of the two estimates. For T = 1, we estimate this effect by using formula (4) without
the last term in curly brackets. Estimation for T = 0 is based on the same formula but with all
time subscripts changed to 0. We ﬁnd that ITN ownership reduced all-cause infant mortality by
a little more than 2 percentage points in both periods (rows 1 and 2 of Table 2). Unfortunately,
the estimate for the preintervention period is quite imprecise because only 495 households in the
sample own a bed net (compared with 1238 in 2004). This also shows in the conﬁdence interval
for the difference in the two estimates, which is quite wide (row 3 of Table 2). However, what
supports the hypothesis of no effects on bed net usage conditional on ownership is the fact that
the difference in the health effects of bed net ownership for the two periods is very close to 0.
This supports the suitability of bed net ownership as a proxy for unobserved usage.
The second check exploits the following observation. Although we do not observe bed net usage for the children in our sample, we have information on whether the mother sleeps under a bed
net. Conditional on bed net ownership, usage should not be different in the preintervention and
post-intervention period. We test for no effect of the intervention conditional on bed net ownership by using a before–after estimator for bed net usage of mothers who own a bed net conditionally on observed predictors of usage. Row 4 in Table 2 shows the result. Unfortunately, as can be
seen from the large standard error and wide conﬁdence interval, this test lacks precision because
only 495 and 1238 households owned a bed net in 2000 and 2004 respectively. However, as the
estimated conﬁdence interval covers zero, we at least cannot reject the hypothesis of no effect.
Another reason why the exclusion restriction may fail is that households save money owing
to the subsidy and may use these resources to invest further in health. We test for the absence of
such behaviour by investigating the effects of the intervention on alternative health investments.
We use our proposed estimator to test for no effect on antenatal care, any type of vaccination and
vitamin A treatments. The results are presented in rows 5–7 of Table 2. All effects are very close
to zero and not statistically signiﬁcant. The standard errors are considerably smaller than in

Evaluating Nationwide Health Interventions

539

the tests that were discussed above. In particular, the effect on any vaccination is estimated very
precisely, making this test quite powerful. Hence, we ﬁnd no evidence for additional investments
in health due to the money saved on heavily subsidized bed nets.
The fact that we do not ﬁnd effects on other health investments is also important for another
reason. It shows that, after controlling for the covariates that we include in the estimation,
there are no differences between ITN owners and non-owners in terms of investments in health.
Consequently, it implies that we must have captured all relevant time changing and time constant
determinants of health-seeking behaviour. This provides important support for the plausibility
of the two unconfoundedness assumptions that we impose.
Another concern is treatment externalities that affect ITN non-owners (Miguel and Kremer,
2004). The main transmission mechanism for malaria are mosquito bites. When a large number
of nets is distributed in a given area, their chemical additives may help to reduce the total number
of mosquitoes in that area. The chances of malaria infection may therefore be reduced also for
ITN non-owners. If this is so, the health outcome of ITN non-owners would improve owing
to the intervention which would violate the exclusion restriction. Hawley et al. (2003) reported
from a large-scale randomized trial in Western Kenya that externalities were only observed if
ITN coverage in treated villages exceeded 50%. In our sample we do observe some clusters with
ITN coverage exceeding 50% but, in more than 60% of our observed clusters in the year 2004,
coverage was considerably lower than 50%. Thus, we do not expect large externalities in Malawi.
However, to investigate the importance of such externalities further, we exploit the idea that
the estimated effects of ITN ownership on health should decrease from the preintervention to
the post-intervention period if the health of ITN non-owners improves because of externalities.
Thus, estimating and comparing the effect of bed net ownership on infant mortality in both
periods (rows 1–3 in Table 2) also provides a test for the importance of treatment externalities.
The fact that we ﬁnd no differential effect supports our hypothesis of no quantitatively important
externalities on the health of ITN non-owners.
The last check is a placebo test that was proposed by Ashraf et al. (2010). They suggested the
use of reporting diarrhoea in the 2 weeks preceding the interview as outcome variable because
the prevalence of diarrhoea should not be related to ITN coverage if the exclusion restriction
holds and all relevant determinants of health-seeking behaviour have been accounted for. Thus,
if our approach succeeds in identifying the effect of the campaign, we should not ﬁnd any
effect on diarrhoea. The results in row 8 of Table 2 show that the effect on diarrhoea is very
close to 0. It is estimated quite precisely with a relatively small standard error and it is not
statistically signiﬁcant. This provides further evidence in favour of our assumption that the
intervention affects health only via its effect on ITN ownership and that we observe all relevant
time constant and time varying determinants of health-seeking behaviour that would confound
the analysis. In conclusion, all plausibility checks and falsiﬁcation tests support our claim that
the results that we present in the next section have a causal interpretation.
3.4. Results
As described in Section 2, we estimate probit models in the 2000 and 2004 samples of the DHS
to obtain the coefﬁcients and, on the basis of that, the predicted probabilities that are used to
correct for selectivity in bed net ownership over time and within each period. The dependent
variable equals 1 if the household owns at least one bed net and is 0 otherwise. Most explanatory
variables are categorical variables which we include as groups of dummy variables. For the few
continuous variables (age, distances to a lake or big city, altitude, wealth index and height) we
include both the continuous variables to capture linear dependences and dummy variables for
grouped versions as indicated in Table 1, to capture potential non-linearities.

†Same estimator as for the effect presented in row 1 of Table 2. See the corresponding note for details. Bootstrap
standard errors and conﬁdence levels are based on 1999 replications. All-cause infant mortality rates are 8.2% in
2000 and 5.4% in 2004.

Response to all relevant questions was very high (usually less than 1% missing, and at most
5%; see Table 1). Nevertheless, to assess how best to cope with missing answers we tested for
zero association with bed net ownership. For each variable with missing values we constructed
an indicator that equals 1 for a given observation if there is a missing entry, and 0 otherwise.
Moreover we generated a dummy variable which equals 1 if there is a missing entry in any of the
variables. We then included these indicator variables in the probit models for ITN ownership
(subject to not causing multicollinearity due to insufﬁcient numbers of observations in one of the
two groups deﬁned by the dependent variable) and tested whether the corresponding coefﬁcients
are individually and jointly equal to 0. This hypothesis cannot be rejected at conventional levels
of signiﬁcance for all missing indicators, which suggests that missing answers are unrelated to
ITN ownership and hence are unproblematic. We therefore do not exclude the few cases with
missing answers but code them as part of the reference group. We present additional sensitivity
checks regarding missing answers further below.
To ensure that our results are representative, we apply the survey weights that were provided in
the DHS: all variables of a given individual that enter the estimation are multiplied by the survey
weight of that observation. In row 10 of Table 3 we present results without survey weights as a
sensitivity check. The main estimation results from the probit models are presented in Table 4
(see Table 6 in Appendix A for the complete speciﬁcation). The probit models have been tested
extensively against misspeciﬁcation in terms of omitted variables as well as heteroscedasticity
or non-normality of the error terms which would violate the assumptions underlying a probit
model (see Appendix A for further details).
Socio-economic status (measured by household wealth as well as education of the mother
and her partner) is among the highly signiﬁcant predictors of bed net ownership. Moreover,

Evaluating Nationwide Health Interventions

in both waves, variables that capture the risk of malaria (altitude and distance to a lake) are
highly signiﬁcant as well. This is in line with economic theory of health-seeking behaviour,
which should be highest if the risk imposed is highest (Geoffard and Philipson, 1996). In the
post-intervention period, the place of delivery of the child is highly signiﬁcant. This is expected as health facilities and village health committees are the key distribution channels for
subsidized bed nets. In general, regions are important for bed net ownership in both waves.
Barriers that prevent women from accessing healthcare are signiﬁcant in the post-intervention
period only, which may also be explained by the formal healthcare sector being an important distribution channel for bed nets after the policy was introduced. Most other control
variables are insigniﬁcant and do not play a major role for bed net ownership given all other
covariates.
We ensure overlap in the covariate distributions of ITN owners and non-owners (common support) by excluding all children from households without or with bed nets with post-intervention
probability of bed net ownership respectively below the lowest or above the highest value of
those children from households respectively with or without bed nets. We do not ﬁnd evidence
for a signiﬁcant common support problem as only 57 children (2.3%) have been removed from
the sample.
In Table 3 we present our estimates of the average effect of Malawi’s ITN distribution programme on child mortality. Our main result from our proposed estimator is reported in the
baseline. We ﬁnd that Malawi’s ITN distribution programme reduced all-cause infant mortality
notably by about 15% or 1.2 percentage points. The reduction is statistically signiﬁcant at the 5%
level. Given the total decline in child mortality of 2.8 percentage points between 2000 and 2004,
the analysis suggests that the bed net distribution programme caused about 43% of the total
decline in the study period. Note that our estimate of −0.0116 lies within the bounds of
[−0:0187, 0] that we derived in Section 3.3 without imposing the assumption that we observe all
time varying determinants of ITN usage, implying that the validity of this assumption cannot
be rejected.
For comparison we also present the effect that is obtained by using the same control variables
when applying a standard conditional before–after estimator instead of our approach in row 1 in
Table 3. With 2.1 percentage points or 26% of the infant mortality rate in 2000 the effect estimate
is much larger. It is at the lower boundary of the conﬁdence interval of our proposed estimator
but still included, implying that the hypothesis of no difference cannot be rejected. However, it
lies outside the bounds of [−0:0187, 0] that we derived in Section 3.3 and is, therefore, implausible
even without imposing the conditional before–after assumption on ITN usage. Moreover, the
difference to our estimate is economically important as the conditional before–after estimate
would attribute 75% rather than 43% of the 2.8-percentage-point decline in infant mortality to
the ITN distribution scheme, which can make a decisive difference in cost–beneﬁt analyses. The
estimate of a reduction in infant mortality by 26% is still considerably lower than the 44% that
was obtained by Fegan et al. (2007) for Kenya, though. They analysed the effect of an expansion
of ITN coverage in Kenya from 7% in 2004 to 67% in 2006 by using a conditional before–after
approach. The difference in the effects is probably due to the much larger expansion in ITN
coverage. Moreover, they used only a very limited number of covariates to control for time
varying determinants of ITN coverage. The results from the estimator that we propose suggest
that it is likely that too much of the reduction in child mortality is attributed to the increase in
ITN coverage in that study.
We perform sensitivity checks to assess the robustness of our results. The ﬁrst presented in
rows 2–10 in Table 3 concern the implementation of the estimator. The effects on the size of
the estimation sample are displayed in Table 5. We start by varying the common support crite-

rion. Both ignoring potential support problems in row 2 and implementing a stricter support
criterion in row 3 leave the results essentially unchanged. In a second step we check the sensitivity of our results to observations with large weights in the inverse probability weighting.
We either trim weights to a maximum of 1/0.1, 1/0.05 or 1/0.01, or discard observations with
higher weights. As only very few observations are affected by this (11, three and none respectively), the results remain unchanged. The results are also largely insensitive to the failure of

applying survey weights in row 10. The effect becomes somewhat smaller but is estimated more
precisely.
The second set of checks presented in rows 11–15 in Table 3 refers to our identifying
assumptions. The identiﬁcation strategy requires controlling for all time varying variables that
affect bed net ownership, as well as for all factors that jointly determine bed net ownership and
infant mortality. These assumptions are not testable. However, we can analyse the sensitivity
of the results to omitting relevant variables, leaving blocks of covariates out of the estimation
procedure. Our results indicate robustness to omitting single blocks of variables in size and

544

signiﬁcance. The strongest changes occur when household or regional variables are excluded,
but the estimated intervention effect is still comparable with the effect that controls for all
variables. The insensitiveness to omitted variables can be either explained by the correlation of
control variables and the ﬂexibility of our speciﬁcation so that other (included) variables pick
up the effect, or by the small variability of child mortality with respect to these omitted characteristics. As also argued by Altonji et al. (2005), this should put further faith in our results, since
one can assume that potentially unobserved characteristics are also likely to play a negligible
role for predicting mortality (in particular conditional on the other included characteristics).
This is also in line with our plausibility checks and falsiﬁcation tests discussed in Section 3.3
which show no indication of omitted confounders.
The last two checks presented in rows 16 and 17 in Table 3 assess the role of missing answers in
the control variables. Neither excluding observations with missing answers in any of the control
variables nor adding an indicator for missing answers in any of the control variables to the probit
models used for selection correction changes our results. This is not surprising given the small
number of missing answers (see Table 1).

Conclusion

We propose a framework to assess the effectiveness of nationwide health interventions that aim at
encouraging health-seeking behaviour. Our identiﬁcation strategy requires that the intervention
is effective only via its effect on the health-seeking behaviour. If this assumption is valid, the
total effect of the intervention can be split into two components: the effect of the intervention
on the health-seeking behaviour, and the effect of the behaviour on the health outcome. We
show how these two effects can be identiﬁed by using different standard identiﬁcation strategies
that are likely to hold in this type of application when good data are available.
We apply this estimator to data from Malawi to evaluate the effectiveness of Malawi’s ITN
distribution programme as part of its Roll-Back-Malaria initiative. This programme was the ﬁrst
of a series of large, nationwide malaria prevention programmes launched in the most affected
developing countries. Our results suggest a robust effect of the campaign of about 1 percentage
point or about 40% of the total reduction in all-cause infant mortality from 8.2% to 5.4%
between 2000 and 2004. The falsiﬁcation tests and robustness checks that we conduct provide
no evidence against validity of our identifying assumptions. The results therefore show that
Malawi’s ITN distribution scheme was effective in reducing mortality among people with the
highest risk of malaria. Hence, the programme made a quantitatively important contribution
towards reaching the goal of halving the number of deaths caused by malaria by 2010 that was
stated in the Abuja declaration.
Even though our paper centres on the evaluation of a malaria prevention campaign, the
method proposed may also be useful for other applications. Many countries have implemented
nationwide health campaigns that focus on altering a speciﬁc behaviour. Examples are antismoking or safer sex campaigns. The effectiveness of these interventions in terms of health
outcomes is still unclear. Our empirical method can potentially be applied to these questions
also. The plausibility checks and falsiﬁcation tests that we propose provide tools to assess the
usefulness of our approach for other applications.

Appendix A: Estimation of the probit models for bed net ownership and
construction of the predicted probabilities
A probit model assumes that the error term is homoscedastic and has a standard normal distribution. The
latter implies that the conditional probability of owning a bed net is modelled as

is the standard normal cumulative distribution function. Table 6 reports the estimated β-coefﬁcients for
the preintervention period, T = 0 (2000), and the post-intervention period, T = 1 (2004). The speciﬁcation
that we use has been tested against misspeciﬁcation in several dimensions. Firstly, we test the normality
assumption on the distribution of the error terms by using a common Jarque–Bera test. Secondly, we
test for heteroscedasticity of the error terms with respect to the variables included in the model following
Davidson and MacKinnon (1984). Lastly, we check for omitted variables by using standard likelihood
ratio tests. We individually test whether the inclusion of any of the variables in Table 1 that are not included
in our model improves the model ﬁt. The model that we estimate and present in Table 6 is not rejected
on the basis of any of the tests that we conducted. The predicted probabilities that are used in the ﬁnal
estimation step are constructed on the basis of the estimated coefﬁcients, β̂ k, T , k = 0, 1, : : : , K, T = 0, 1,

Appendix B: Proofs
We denote by Y 1 the potential health outcome if exposed to the campaign (I = 1), and by Y 0 the potential
health outcome without the campaign (I = 0). Let T = 0 denote the preintervention time period, and T = 1
the post-intervention time period. For a nationwide intervention we have I = T . We are interested in the
average effect for those subject to the intervention which is equal to the average effect for the population
observed after the campaign was launched at T = 1:
θ ≡ E.Y 1 − Y 0 |I = 1/ = E.Y 1 − Y 0 |T = 1/:
Let B ∈ {0, 1} indicate whether somebody engages in the health-seeking behaviour (ITN usage) or not.
Furthermore, let Y 0B denote the potential outcome with a given behaviour B ∈ {0, 1} in case there was no
intervention, and Y 1B is the potential outcome for a person with the same behaviour B who was exposed
to the intervention. Let B1 denote the potential behaviour if the person is exposed to the intervention, and
B0 the potential behaviour if the person is not exposed to the intervention. The notation implies that
Y 1 = B1 Y 11 + .1 − B1 /Y 10 ,
Y 0 = B0 Y 01 + .1 − B0 /Y 00 :

Denote by X the vector of confounding variables. Identiﬁcation is based on the following ﬁve assumptions
(assumptions 1–5):
B ∈ {0, 1},
E.Y 0B / = E.Y 1B /,
B1  B0 ,
E.B0 |T = 1, X = x/ = E.B0 |T = 0, X = x/,
Y 11 , Y 10 ⊥B|X,
0 < p1 .x/ ≡ Pr.B = 1|T = 1, X = x/ < 1:
Additionally, we impose the stable unit treatment value assumption which is common in the evaluation
literature (Heckman et al., 1999) and is used to relate unobserved potential outcomes to observed outcomes.
Let B and Y denote the observed behaviour and observed outcome respectively. In our setting, the stable
unit treatment value assumption implies the following observation rule:
B = IB1 + .1 − I/B0 = TB1 + .1 − T/B0 ;
Y = IY 1 + .1 − I/Y 0 = TY 1 + .1 − T/Y 0 :
Under assumptions 1 and 2 the parameter of interest can be rewritten as the effect of the intervention for
those who change behaviour in the intended direction times the probability to do so:
E.Y 1 − Y 0 |T = 1/ = E.Y 1 − Y 0 |T = 1, B0 = 0, B1 = 0/ P.B0 = 0, B1 = 0|T = 1/
+ E.Y 1 − Y 0 |T = 1, B0 = 1, B1 = 1/ P.B0 = 1, B1 = 1|T = 1/
+ E.Y 1 − Y 0 |T = 1, B0 = 0, B1 = 1/ P.B0 = 0, B1 = 1|T = 1/
+ E.Y 1 − Y 0 |T = 1, B0 = 1, B1 = 0/ P.B0 = 1, B1 = 0|T = 1/
= E.Y 1 − Y 0 |T = 1, B0 = 0, B1 = 1/ P.B0 = 0, B1 = 1|T = 1/
+ E.Y 1 − Y 0 |T = 1, B0 = 1, B1 = 0/P.B0 = 1, B1 = 0|T = 1/
= E.Y 1 − Y 0 |T = 1, B0 = 0, B1 = 1/ P.B0 = 0, B1 = 1|T = 1/

by assumption 1
by assumption 2.

Under assumptions 2 and 3 the term P.B0 = 0, B1 = 1|T = 1, X = x/ equals the effect of the intervention I
on behaviour B and is identiﬁed from observed objects:
P.B0 = 0, B1 = 1|T = 1, X = x/ = P.B0 = 0, B1 = 1|T = 1, X = x/ + P.B0 = 1, B1 = 1|T = 1, X = x/
− {P.B0 = 1, B1 = 1|T = 1, X = x/
+ P.B0 = 1, B1 = 0|T = 1, X = x/}
by assumption 2
= P.B1 = 1|T = 1, X = x/ − P.B0 = 1|T = 1, X = x/
= E.B1 |T = 1, X = x/ − E.B0 |T = 1, X = x/

by assumption 3
= E.B|T = 1, X = x/ − E.B|T = 0, X = x/:
Assumptions 1 and 4 identify the component E.Y 1 − Y 0 |T = 1, B0 = 0, B1 = 1/:
E.Y 1 − Y 0 |T = 1, B0 = 0, B1 = 1/ = E{B1 Y 11 + .1 − B1 /Y 10 − B0 Y 01 − .1 − B0 /Y 00 |T = 1, B0 = 0, B1 = 1}

Applying Bayes’s rule we can write
P.B0 = 0, B1 = 1|T = 1, X = x/ f.x|T = 1/
:
P.B0 = 0, B1 = 1|T = 1/
Consequently, we obtain for the parameter of interest

where the last line depends only on observed objects and where all elements are non-parametrically identiﬁed without additional assumptions. However, note that, in applications, integration over the distribution
of all relevant covariates requires that we observe households with the same values of the covariates who
do and do not use ITNs, i.e. that there is overlap in the covariate distributions of ITN users and non-users.
This is formalized in the so-called common support assumption 5.
To derive an estimator for θ, we use Bayes’s rule to rewrite
f.x|T = 1/ =

P.B = b|T = 1/ f.x|B = b, T = 1/
:
P.B = b|T = 1, X = x/

Let N1 denote the number of post-intervention observations at T = 1 that satisfy common support (3).
Furthermore, let x1i , b1i and y1i denote the observed values of respectively X, B and Y for individual i at
T = 1. Moreover, let p̂1 .x1 / denote the estimator for P.B = 1|T = 1, X = x1 /, and let p̂0 .x0 / denote the
estimator for P.B = 1|T = 0, X = x0 /. To obtain p̂0 .x1 / ≡ P.B = 1|T = 0, X = x1 / we shall estimate parametrically P.B = 1|T = 0, X = x0 / by using the data at T = 0 and then calculate the predicted values for
the population at T = 1 by using the estimated coefﬁcients and x1i . A semiparametric estimator for the
parameter of interest θ is then given by

θ̂ belongs to the class of inverse probability weighting estimators. Newey (1984) showed that under the
standard regularity conditions used for generalized
√ method-of-moment (GMM) estimation, which are
considered to be weak, an estimator of this type is N consistent and asymptotically normally distributed
if p̂0 .x1 / and p̂1 .x1 / are consistent and asymptotically normal estimators of p0 .x1 / and p1 .x1 / respectively.
We use the result by Newey (1984) to derive the asymptotic distribution of our estimator.
We use consistent and asymptotically normally distributed parametric estimators for the probabilities
that appear in the weights of the inverse probability weighting estimator of the parameter of interest.
These estimators can be interpreted as GMM estimators where the moment conditions correspond to
the derivatives of the (log-)likelihood function of the maximum likelihood estimators with respect to the
parameter vector of interest:

@L0 .·, β0 /=@β0
g0 .x0 , b0 , β0 /

.10/
@L1 .·, β1 /=@β1
g1 .x1 , b1 , β1 /
where the subscript 0 refers to the estimation of p0 .x0 , β0 / ≡ P.B = 1|T = 0, X = x0 /, and where the subscript
1 refers to the estimation of p1 .x1 , β1 / ≡ P.B = 1|T = 1, X = x1 /.
One complication that arises in our speciﬁc case is that p0 .x0 , β0 / is estimated on the data from T = 0
whereas p1 .x1 , β1 / is estimated on the data from T = 1. However, the approach that was proposed by
Newey (1984) can still be applied with the following adaptation. Assume that the data from T = 0 and
T = 1 are stacked on top of each other, resulting in a sample size of N = N0 + N1 and variables x = .x0 x1 / ,
b = .b0 b1 / and y = .y0 y1 / . If only observations from T = 1 should be used to estimate a given set of
parameters, all variables are multiplied by T . For T = 0, all variables are multiplied by 1 − T . Also, the
number of observations must be corrected in case averages are used. Thus, the moment conditions that
use the stacked data are

Newey (1984) showed that for the special case where the ﬁrst-step moment conditions for β do not depend
on the second-step parameter θ, as here, this type of estimator is consistent and asymptotically normally
distributed if a set of regularity conditions are satisﬁed (Newey (1984), page 202). The conditions include
stationary and ergodic data, ﬁnite parameters that are not at the boundary of the parameter space, existence, measurability and continuity of the ﬁrst- and second-moment functions and their derivatives, as well
as full rank of the derivatives of the moment conditions with respect to the parameters. Furthermore, the
sample moments should converge to their population counterparts with diminishing variance (consistent
estimators) and should yield uniquely identiﬁed solutions for the unknown parameters. These conditions
are considered rather weak, especially with independent and identically distributed data in the dimension
i as in random samples of repeated cross-sections (see also Hansen (1982) and Newey and McFadden
(1994)). Applying the result by Newey (1984) our estimator is consistent and asymptotically normally
distributed with asymptotic covariance matrix
