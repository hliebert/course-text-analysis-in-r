Statistical Treatment Choice: An Application
to Active Labor Market Programs
Markus F RÖLICH
Choosing among a number of treatments the most suitable for a particular client is an issue of everyday concern. In this article two
methodological advances for statistically assisted treatment choice are developed: First, it permits one to combine a dataset on previously
treated clients with a dataset on new clients when the regressors available in these two datasets do not coincide. It thereby incorporates
additional regressors on previously treated clients that are not available for the current clients. Such a situation often arises because of
cost considerations, data confidentiality reasons, or time delays in data availability. Second, statistical inference on the recommended
treatment choice is analyzed and conveyed to the agent or caseworker in a comprehensible and transparent way. The implementation of this
methodology in a pilot study in Switzerland for choosing among active labor market programs for unemployed job seekers is described.

1. INTRODUCTION
Choosing among a number of available treatments the most
suitable for a given subject is an issue of everyday concern.
A physician has to choose an appropriate medical drug treatment for a given patient, based on a number of observed covariates X and prior experience. A counselor must choose
among the different types of rehabilitation therapies available
for persons with alcohol-related problems. As a third example, which will guide the application in this article, we examine the choice of an active labor market program for an unemployed job seeker. In many countries, the caseworkers in charge
have a number of different training programs at their disposal
to which they can assign an unemployed person to increase her
chances of finding a job. These treatment options often include
job search training, language training, computer training, vocational skills training, further training, retraining as well as
employment programs, wage subsidies, and so on. In addition,
there is the option of not assigning any program. In all these
situations, the best treatment choice may depend on the characteristics of the individual. Statistics can help in attaining better choices: Statistical predictions of treatment outcomes on an
individual basis can be communicated to the physician, caseworker, or the job seeker to produce more informed treatment
choices.
Providing such estimates of treatment effects for various demographic groups to physicians has a long history in the medical literature, but these are often based on randomized trials
and reported only for very broadly defined demographic groups
(e.g., men, women, adolescents, children). In recent years, there
has been a strong interest in using statistical tools in other fields
and, in particular, for assigning active labor market programs,
where usually no experimental data are available and where covariate information should be accounted for in much more detail than considering only broad demographic groups. This interest in profiling and targeting of active labor market programs
is demonstrated by several recent publications, for example, the
book Targeting Employment Services by Eberts, O’Leary, and

Smith (2006).
In this article two methodological advances are developed
and then applied to the choice among Swiss active labor market programs. First, a methodology is proposed to assist treatment choice in a situation where a large and informative database with information on many characteristics W is available
for deriving statistical predictions but only a limited number of
covariates X is observed for the individual for whom a choice
has to be made. (In most of the previous literature, it was assumed that all confounding variables are observed, whereas we
permit partial observation.) Second, statistical inference on the
recommended treatment choice is analyzed.
The situation where a large set of characteristics W for previously treated clients is available but recommendations are to be
based on a smaller set of covariates X occurs in many settings
where an expert has to make a choice but has only limited access to the entire knowledge database, for example, because of
limitations in reporting, confidentiality or data privacy reasons,
costs of measuring covariates, time delays in data availability,
or different measurement scales.
For example, consider that recommendations about the best
treatment choice for women and for men are to be derived from
a large drug trial. Here, X is gender, and W refers to additional
covariate information collected during the trial. If the drug trial
was not randomized, the additional covariate information will
often be very important to obtain unbiased gender-specific estimates of the treatment effects in that they control for selection
bias. In the other example, X may be a set of information the
caseworker has about an unemployed person, whereas W contains additional information on earnings and employment histories obtained from databases not accessible to the caseworker.
Again, because allocation to labor market programs has usually
been nonrandom in the past, incorporating this additional W
information is important to account for nonrandom selection.
In the following, a methodology is developed to include this
additional covariate information, which is applicable in linear
and in nonlinear models, for example, for a binary or bounded
outcome variable such as a client’s employment status.

Journal of the American Statistical Association, June 2008

This methodology is then applied to assisting caseworkers in
choosing among active labor market programs (ALMPs) for unemployed job seekers. ALMPs were introduced in many countries during the early 1990s to combat problems of high and persistent unemployment or low earnings of disadvantaged groups
through the public provision of training, job creation schemes,
subsidized, jobs and wage subsidies. Recent evaluation studies often found these programs to be relatively unsuccessful on
average but also concluded that some individuals seem to benefit more from training than others (cf. Heckman, Smith, and
Clements 1997; Gerfin and Lechner 2002; Gerfin, Lechner, and
Steiger 2005, for evidence on treatment effect heterogeneity).
This triggered a recent trend emphasizing the need for a better
targeting of these programs, in other words, for choosing more
carefully the most adequate program for each unemployed person on an individual basis. Several countries have expressed
their interest in using statistical support systems. Switzerland
decided to pilot a statistical targeting system and conducted a
randomized field study in 2005 based on the methodology developed in this article. Further details can be found in Frölich
(2006).
2. OPTIMAL TREATMENT CHOICE
Suppose there are R different and mutually exclusive treatments. An individual i at time t needs to receive one of these
treatments and requests advice in choosing the best treatment. It
may be that individual i chooses the treatment for herself or that
an agent, for example, a caseworker in the employment office,
makes the choice. One of the available treatment options will
often be not to take any training now, but leaving the option
1
R
, . . . , Yi,t+τ
be the potential outcomes for
for later. Let Yi,t+τ
individual i at some time t + τ , for example, the employment
1
is the outcome that individual i would realize
status. The Yi,t+τ
2
if taking treatment 1. Similarly, Yi,t+τ
is the realized outcome
if taking treatment 2, and so on.
The unknown optimal treatment choice for individual i
would be
r
.
ri∗ = arg max Yi,t+τ
r

We aim to estimate the optimal choice on the basis of observed
covariates Xi,t :
r
r ∗ (Xi,t ) = arg max E[Yt+τ
|X = Xi,t ],
r∈{1,...,R}

where Xi,t may include, for example, age, gender, or past
health status. These estimates can then be made available to
the agents or the individuals themselves, for example, through
the Internet, to assist them in their choices. (See also Manski
2000, 2004.) For estimating, r ∗ (Xi,t ) two issues are of interest:
(1) consistent estimation of the expected potential outcomes
r |X = X ] and (2) information on the statistical preciE[Yt+τ
i,t
sion of the estimated r ∗ (Xi,t ). In the following, the subscripts
t +τ and t are suppressed and assumed to be implicitly included
in Y and X.
For estimating E[Y r |X], we may resort to data on previous
treatment recipients. For these previously treated clients, we often have more detailed information available than for the current clients, which can help to obtain more reliable estimates.
Apart from observing their realized outcomes Y , we may not

only know their covariates X, for example, age and gender, but
additionally a vector of further characteristics W : employment
and earnings histories, subjective assessments, information on
family background, and so on. These additional covariates W
are not available for individual i at the time when predictions
are to be made; hence, the predictions of expected potential outcomes can only be based on the covariates X. There can be several reasons for this unavailability, such as data security, costs of
data collection, time delays in data availability, and changes in
variable definitions. For example, in our application to ALMP,
social security data with information on entire employment and
earnings histories of past participants was available for estimating parameters but is not available for the day-to-day operations
in the employment offices. See also Frölich (2006).
Although we cannot base treatment choice on E[Y r |W, X]
but only on E[Y r |X], the additional information on W for past
clients can often account for selection bias and enable consistent estimation of E[Y r |X]. This article develops a methodology for including such W variables in the estimation of nonlinear models.
Let {(Yj , Xj , Wj , Dj )}N
j =1 be the available data on previous
treatment recipients, where Dj ∈ {1, . . . , R} indicates the reD

ceived treatment. The Yj ≡ Yj j is the realized outcome. If the
treatment had not been randomly administered in the past, the
potential outcome Y d among those who decided to take treatment d usually is different from those who decided not to take
this treatment: E[Y d |D = d] = E[Y d |D = d]. For example,
those who decided to participate in training may be more motivated or higher skilled than those who did not. In other words,
Y d and D are confounded. This selection problem can be overcome by conditioning on all confounding variables. Often it
will not be sufficient to condition only on the set of covariates
X, but also on W to eliminate selection bias:
E[Y d |X, W, D = d] = E[Y d |X, W ].

(1)

This assumption, known as selection on observables, ignorable
treatment assignment, or conditional independence assumption,
identifies the potential outcomes E[Y d |X, W ].
Plausibility of this assumption often requires a very rich database with many variables W . As discussed previously, many of
these variables are not available when it comes to making a
choice decision for individual i and, thus, cannot be included in
X. Therefore, we need to identify E[Y d |X] instead, which can
be achieved by integrating out the W variables

d
E[Y |X] = E[Y d |X, W ] dFW |X

=

E[Y |X, W, D = d] dFW |X .

Hence, the expected potential outcomes are nonparametrically
identified, provided that the support of FW |X,D=d is the same
as of FW |X or, equivalently, that
Pr(D = d|W, X = x) > 0 a.s.

for all d

for every x where predictions need to be made. This is a common support condition.
Hence, in principle, E[Y d |X] is nonparametrically identified and could be estimated using nonparametric regression for

Frölich: Active Labor Market Programs

549

E[Y |X, W, D = d] and weighting this regression function by an
estimate of dFW |X . If X is discrete with only a few mass points,
for example, gender by age groups, E[Y d |X] can be estimated
separately for each value of X, say by conventional matching
estimators as in Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd (1998), Imbens
(2004), or Frölich (2004).
However, if one intends to obtain finer predictions in the
sense that there are many more X partitions in the population,
generated by continuous regressors and/or discrete regressors
with many mass points, as in our application, this nonparametric approach to integrate out the W characteristics will not
work well. The number of observations with Xj = x would
be very small or zero and estimating dFW |X by the empirical distribution function of W in the X = x subpopulation
will be impossible or imprecise. A more involved nonparametric density estimate of dFW |X that also incorporates observations with Xj = x but very close to x would be required.
However, integrating out the nonparametric density d F̂W |X can
lead to rather imprecise estimates of E[Y r |X]. In this situation,
parametric or semiparametric approaches are more appropriate.
In addition, there is also a practical concern about nonparametric estimation in that it can be too time consuming. If X
contains a large predictor set, it will no longer be feasible to
tabulate all estimates of E[Y r |X] for r = 1, . . . , R. It is more
appropriate to estimate E[Y r |X] on demand, that is, at the time
when a decision must be made for a client with characteristics
Xi .
Another reason is data security. With a parametric specification, the data {(Yj , Xj , Wj , Dj )}N
j =1 are needed only once to

estimate the coefficients. Thereafter, Ê[Y r |X] can be calculated
from the estimated coefficients, and the full dataset is no longer
needed and can be disconnected from the software producing
the predictions. A nonparametric approach would always require direct access to the full dataset.
For these reasons, using a parametric specification for
E[Y r |X] helps to obtain faster and more precise predictions.
Let the outcomes be specified as
.
E[Y |X = x] = ϕ(x; θ r )
r

for r = 1, . . . , R,

where ϕ is a known function and θ r an unknown coefficient
vector of dimension k. To obtain precise predictions of Y r in
L2 distance, one wants to choose the coefficients θ r as


θ∗r = arg min E (Y r − ϕ(X; θ ))2
(2)
θ

or, equivalently,

2 
θ∗r = arg min E E[Y r |X] − ϕ(X; θ ) .
θ

However, estimation of θ∗r is not feasible because the potential
outcomes Y r are not observed: Y r is only observed for those
individuals who received treatment r but not for all the other
individuals. Nevertheless, one can show that the minimizer of
(2) is identical to the minimizer of an expression that does not
contain any potential outcomes:

Theorem 1. The two minimizers in the following expression
are identical:


arg min E (Y r − ϕ(X; θ ))2
θ


Y · 1(D = r)
= arg min E
− ϕ(X; θ )
p r (X, W )
θ

,

(3)

where 1(·) is the indicator function and
p r (x, w) = Pr(D = r|X = x, W = w);
see the Appendix. This is shown by noting that

Y · 1(D = r)
X = E[Y r |X].
E
p r (X, W )

(4)

The function p r (x, w) is the propensity score, which adjusts
for the differences in the X and W distributions across participants and nonparticipants. Because nonparametric estimation
of p r (x, w) leads to the same difficulties mentioned previously,
we shall also impose a parametric (logistic) specification for the
propensity score, which is estimated in a first step before the
r
estimation of θ . One can also show
√ rthat θ∗ is2 identical to the
minimizer of E[((Y − ϕ(X; θ ))/ p (X, W )) |D = r], which
leads to a weighted nonlinear least squares estimator of Y on
ϕ(X; θ ) with inverse propensity score weighting in the D = r
sample. (Both approaches give the same asymptotic estimates
but can be different for small samples.) The relationship laid
out in Theorem 1 will be developed into a GMM estimator in
Section 4 to incorporate joint inference on all estimated θ̂ r with
estimated propensity scores.
Having estimated the coefficients θ r for all treatments r =
1, . . . , R, the expected potential outcomes Ŷi1 , . . . , ŶiR can be
predicted for an individual i where
Ŷir = Ê[Y r |X = Xi ] = ϕ(Xi ; θ̂ r ).
The optimal treatment for individual i is then estimated to be
r̂i∗ = arg max Ŷir .
r

This information can be provided to the individual or agent to
assist treatment choice.
In addition to these predictions themselves, it is also of interest to have some information about the statistical precision
in the estimation of r̂i∗ . If r̂i∗ is very imprecisely estimated, the
agent or the individual should not trust these estimates and will
want additional information before making a decision. On the
other hand, if r̂i∗ is very precisely estimated, the agent will be
more likely to follow these statistical predictions.
For practical purposes, it is important to convey this information about statistical precision to the individual or caseworker in
a simple and accessible way. Providing caseworkers with standard errors or variance–covariance matrices would not be appropriate because caseworkers are usually not trained in thinking in terms of confidence intervals or statistical tests. As a
more transparent alternative, we suggest grouping the available
treatments into three categories: “good”, “intermediate,” and
“bad” treatments, based on the results of a multiple comparison with the best (MCB) analysis. These results can easily be
shown and explained to caseworkers and other decision makers.

Let ri∗ denote the (unknown) best treatment for each individual

3. APPLICATION TO ACTIVE LABOR
MARKET PROGRAMS

ri∗ = arg max Yir .

In many countries, ALMPs were introduced during the 1990s
to combat the problems of high and persistent unemployment
or low earnings of disadvantaged groups. These programs often include job search training, placement services, counseling,
training in computer skills, language training, vocational training, employment programs (job creation schemes), wage subsidies, and so forth and last from a few weeks to several months.
Many countries introduced ALMPs on a large scale, expecting them to reduce mass unemployment rapidly. The initial enthusiasm has waned in recent years since several evaluation
studies found rather moderate or even negative effects. (See,
e.g., Fay 1996; Puhani 1999; Lechner 2000; Gerfin and Lechner 2002; among many others.) These results have prompted
several changes in the design of ALMPs. Programs have been
modified or scaled down. There has also been a general trend
toward providing ALMPs only or predominantly to those individuals who are expected to benefit from them, reflecting the
belief that ALMPs are neither beneficial for everyone nor harmful to everyone. To support such a more deliberate targeting of
ALMPs, statistical profiling systems have been piloted in several countries, often with mixed results.
Profiling attempts to estimate the risk of becoming longterm unemployed when not receiving any assistance and assigns
those unemployed who are most at risk to ALMPs. Implicit is
the assumption that those least likely to become long-term unemployed do not benefit (much) from ALMPs, whereas those
with the largest risk will benefit most. This implicit assumption
often seems not to be true, as found, for example, in Berger et
al. (2001) and Black et al. (2003). Basically, profiling systems
base their decision only on estimates of the potential outcome
Y 1 , where r = 1 represents the treatment “no participation in
ALMP.” The potential outcomes Y 2 , . . . , Y R for participation
in different ALMPs are not estimated and, thereby, neglected.
The aim of the targeting system developed in this article is
to estimate Yi1 along with Yi2 , . . . , YiR for every individual and
to determine the ALMP that provides the highest outcome. (For
a more detailed discussion on profiling and targeting systems,
see Frölich, Lechner, and Steiger 2003; Plesca and Smith 2005;
Lechner and Smith 2006.)

r

We want to know the probability that our estimate of the best
treatment is, in fact, the best treatment. If this probability is not
very large, we also would like to know which other treatments
might be good as well. In other words, we need to estimate a
set Ŝi of treatments that contains the best treatment with high
probability
Pr(ri∗ ∈ Ŝi ) ≥ 1 − α,
where 1 − α is the confidence level. A multiple comparison
with the best approach produces estimates of the set Ŝi as well
r∗

Downloaded by [Universitaet St Gallen] at 08:04 06 May 2013

as confidence intervals for Yi i − Yir such that
r∗

Pr(ri∗ ∈ Ŝi and L̂i,r ≤ Yi i − Yir ≤ Ûi,r for all r = 1, . . . , R)
≥ 1 − α,
where L̂i,r , Ûi,r are estimated lower and upper bounds (Horrace
and Schmidt 2000). The estimates of Ŝi and L̂i,r , thus, distinguish three types of treatments. A treatment r with r ∈ Ŝi belongs to the set of best treatments. A treatment r with L̂i,r > 0,
r∗
that is, Yi i > Yir , is clearly worse than the best treatment.
Finally, treatments with r ∈
/ Ŝi but L̂i,r = 0, which implies
r∗

Yi i ≥ Yir , are intermediate in that they do not belong to the
set of best treatments and they are not clearly worse than the
best treatment.
We, therefore, suggest providing the caseworker with the
predictions Ŷi1 , . . . , ŶiR together with an estimate of the sets
of “good,” “intermediate,” and “bad” treatments. If Ŝi contains only a single element, the caseworker can be rather confident that the estimated best treatment r̂i∗ is likely to be the
best choice. If Ŝi contains a few treatments, at least the caseworker knows which is the estimated best treatment, which
other treatments might be good as well, and which treatments
are probably worse. On the other hand, if Ŝi contains (almost)
all treatments, the caseworker knows that the information available in the statistical system is insufficient and too unreliable
to be of much assistance. In this situation, the caseworker may
want to follow other guidelines for treatment choice, for example, waiting times, supply constraints, personal preferences,
and so on. The cardinality of the set Ŝi can vary from individual to individual according to the characteristics Xi , and
it is quite likely that for some individuals Ŝi will be a singleton, whereas for other individuals the set Ŝi may contain
all available treatments. Hence, we can distinguish between
individuals where the statistical system provides precise estimates and individuals where it fails to provide useful information.
The following sections describe how this statistical targeting
system was implemented for Swiss active labor market policies
and piloted from May to December 2005.

3.1 ALMPs in Switzerland
In Switzerland, a large number of active programs are available, financed by federal unemployment insurance funds. Allocation to a program is at the caseworker’s full discretion, and
noncompliance by the unemployed leads to a suspension of
benefit payments. The targeting system was piloted in five different regions; the following discussion, however, restricts itself
to Basel city only. In Basel, the ALMPs can be categorized into
six (R = 6) groups:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

No program
Job search and personality courses
Language skills training
Computer skills training
Further training
Employment programs.

Frölich: Active Labor Market Programs

The first treatment “no program,” means that the job seeker is
not allocated to any ALMP during the current month but leaves
the option for the future if the job seeker is still unemployed.
Treatment categories 2–6 contain active programs. Treatment 2
consists of training in job search strategies and résumé writing
and personality courses, which provide psychological backing
and coaching in developing new perspectives to entering the
labor market. Treatment 3 contains language and communication skills training for foreigners as well as courses in foreign
languages at different levels. Treatment 4, computer skills training, refers mostly to general courses in office applications such
as word processing and spreadsheet calculations but also stockkeeping and order management software. Treatment 5 consists
of further training in the job seeker’s occupation and lasts from
1 week to 2 months. Treatment 6 consists of subsidized employment or job creation schemes in a sheltered labor market, usually of 3–6 months’ duration. This includes activities
in cantonal and municipal administrations (including hospitals,
kindergartens, schools) and nonregular workplaces in charitable, cultural, recycling, environmental protection, or other nonprofit organizations. Internships are also included here.
Given the large number of active labor market programs
available, the preceding grouping into only five broad categories may appear rather rough. There are several reasons for
not choosing very narrow categories, in addition to the concern about diminished statistical precision caused by small samples. First, all of the R defined treatment options should make
sense for every job seeker. If one of the treatments were defined
as a language course for foreigners, it would not be a reasonable option for a Swiss job seeker and no predictions should be
made as such a program will be dismissed from the outset. The
choice set R ∈ {1, . . . , 6} would, thus, depend on the characteristics Xit and would have to be treated as a function of Xit ,
which would complicate the implementation. By defining a category language skills training, which includes German, French,
and foreign language courses, this category becomes feasible
for every job seeker, and the Xit characteristics (e.g., mother
tongue, profession) define which type of language course or
training is appropriate.
A second reason is that the caseworker may actually have
much better information for choosing the exact course out of a
broader category. The statistical system may be able to estimate
how much the labor market values different types of training but
cannot recommend whether an advanced or intermediate English course is more appropriate. The caseworker may also know
better about local waiting lists or supply constraints that must
be taken into account when allocating a course.
Third, in the pilot study, employment predictions were made
for the year 2005/2006 based on data on participants from the
years 2001–2003. During these years, some of these courses
were modified and providers changed in several details. But the
broad structure of these programs remained largely unchanged.
Therefore, we do not want to define treatments too narrowly, as
specific courses may be rather different today.
The outcome variable Yi,t+τ for individual i when a decision is taken at time t is defined as the number of months in
stable employment within the subsequent 12 months, divided
by 12. An employment spell is considered as stable if it is of
at least 3 months’ duration. Hence, jobs of short duration are

551

not considered as a positive outcome. This emphasizes rapid
re-employment but avoids reregistration of unemployment.
Given this description of the ALMP and the outcome variable, it should be pointed out that the targeting system developed later implicitly makes the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA), which assumes the absence of any treatment effect externalities on other persons. In other words, the
employment outcomes Yi1 –YiR should not depend on the treatment allocation of other individuals. While this assumption
might often be innocuous when choosing between various medical drug treatments, the effect of a particular ALMP might depend on the number and the composition (stigma effects) of the
other participants. The large-scale use of a profiling or targeting
system might then invalidate its own estimates. This is an interesting avenue for future research, and the only remedy we can
suggest so far is to re-estimate the system, for example, about
every 6 months.
For the specific application in Switzerland discussed here,
violations of SUTVA might not be of too much concern. Certainly, changes in the wage structure and general equilibrium
effects due to changes in the number of skilled and unskilled
persons can almost be ruled out because the ALMPs do not include retraining or very long training courses but rather short
(refresher) courses. Given the relatively short duration of the
courses and the overall low unemployment rates in Switzerland,
the total amount of time in courses relative to the total labor
force is negligible. Of more concern might be that the effectiveness of these courses and of the employment programs could
depend on the general motivation and interaction of all participants. The course composition might also affect the valuation of
these courses by potential employers. It should be pointed out
that the wage subsidy for regular temporary jobs (Zwischenverdienst), presumably the most distorting measure, is not included
in the choice set of the caseworker R ∈ {1, . . . , 6} as this program is often initiated by the unemployed themselves and not
assigned by a caseworker. To conclude, externalities probably
exist, but they are considered to be of second order in this application.
3.2 Data and Variables
Two types of datasets are required for implementing the
statistical system. First, an extensive database on previously
treated clients is needed that contains sufficient information on
X and W variables to make the conditional independence assumption (1) valid. This requires individual information on personal characteristics and labor market histories as well as a sufficient sample size for precise estimation. The second dataset
contains the new clients for whom predictions about expected
outcomes shall be made. For them, only information on the X
variables is needed, at the time the treatment has to be chosen.
The first dataset for the estimation of the coefficients θ r
consists of the entire population of individuals who registered
as job seekers at an employment office anytime during January 2001–December 2003. For these 460,442 persons, information from the unemployment insurance information system
(AVAM/ASAL) is available up to December 2004 as well as information from the social security records (AHV) for the period
January 1990–December 2002. These combined data sources

Downloaded by [Universitaet St Gallen] at 08:04 06 May 2013

Journal of the American Statistical Association, June 2008

contain very detailed information on registration and deregistration of unemployment, benefit payments and sanctions, participation in ALMP, 11 years of employment histories with
monthly information on earnings and employment status, and a
lot of information on socioeconomic characteristics, including
qualification, education, language skills (mother tongue, proficiency of foreign languages), job position, experience, profession, industry, and an employability rating by the caseworker.
Table 1 contains descriptive statistics on a few selected X and
W variables.
The data for the new clients during the pilot study in 2005
are based on the unemployment insurance information system
for all new job seekers and are updated every 2 weeks. They
do not contain any social security information, and some information on previous participation in ALMPs and interim jobs is
available only with a delay.
Table 2 lists all X and W variables that were used in the estimation. The X variables contain individual characteristics but
also variables characterizing the season (month) and the local
labor market (regional unemployment rate, industry unemployment rate, industry vacancy rate). These variables are important
because the employment data from 2002 to 2004 are used for
predicting employment outcomes in 2005/2006.
Because job seekers can be assigned to a treatment anytime
during their unemployment spell in our observation window
2001–2003, we can define Dj t , Xj t , Wj t , Yj,t+τ on a monthly
basis, yielding 36 panel observations for every person. This
gives a total of 16.6 million panel observations (460,442 individuals times 36 months). In any month, a job seeker might have
been assigned to a program Dj t ∈ {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} or might not be
in a program Dj t = 1. In most of these months, however, no
decision was taken at all (Dj t undefined), for example, because
the individual was already in a program of longer duration or
had found a job. Such months do not represent choice-relevant
situations because the caseworker would not initiate a training
or employment program under these circumstances. In the following, let Sj t indicate whether person j in month t was in a
choice-relevant situation or not. Sj t is 0 if the person (1) is not
entitled to participate in an ALMP because of not being registered as unemployed or not having contributed sufficiently to
the unemployment funds or having exhausted unemployment
benefits, (2) already participates in a training or employment
program of longer duration, (3) is temporarily employed in an
interim job, or (4) deregisters anytime during the month. Otherwise, Sj t = 1. Deleting all observations with Sj t = 0 leaves 2.3
million observations. In most of these months, treatment 1 (i.e.,
no program) was selected.
In addition, the sample was restricted to those regions where
the pilot employment offices were located. Persons below 20 or
above 60 years of age or those who were disabled were deleted.
4. IMPLEMENTATION
4.1 Estimation
The implementation of the targeting system proceeds in two
steps. First, all coefficients θ r are estimated from data on past
participants. Second, with these estimates, expected potential
outcomes and best treatment choices can be predicted for new
clients.

The estimation of the coefficients θ r for the expected potential outcomes E[Y r |X] itself proceeds in two steps, separately
for each of the R programs. In a first step, the propensity score
is estimated by maximum likelihood logit by specifying
p r (x, w; β r ) = (x βxr + w βwr ),
where β r = (βxr , βwr ), (u) = 1/(1 + e−u ), and x includes
a constant. Because the propensity score enters inversely in
the estimation of the function ϕ(x; θ r ), very small estimated
propensity scores could affect the results unduly. Therefore, the
estimated p̂jr are capped at .02 of the mean of the propensity
scores in the D = r subpopulation.
In the next step, the E[Y r |X] are estimated using the relationship (4). The parametric specification of E[Y r |X] should take
the peculiarities of the outcome variable into account. Here, the

outcome variable is bounded between 0 and at most 1 year of
employment during the observation window. In addition, the
observed outcome is 0 for about two-thirds of the observations.
Hence, a simple logit specification did not fit this outcome variable well. It appears more appropriate to consider the outcome
as a result of two processes: (1) finding a job (Y r > 0), which
is modeled by a logit model
Pr(Y r > 0|X = x) = (x θ1r ),

(5)

with θ1r a vector of coefficients, and (2) keeping this job for a
number of months, E[Y r |Y r > 0, X]. With Y r |Y r > 0 bounded,
a logistic function is used:
E[Y r |Y r > 0, X = x] = (α r + γ r x θ1r + x2 θ2r ),

(6)

554

Journal of the American Statistical Association, June 2008

where α r , γ r , and θ2r are unknown coefficients and x2 is a subset of x. Without the term x2 θ2r in the expression (6), the expected job duration would be assumed to depend on the characteristics X only through the same single index x θ1r as the
probability of finding a job (5). Including variables X2 in specification (6) permits these variables to have a different impact
on job duration than on the probability of finding a job.
Let θ r denote all coefficients together, that is, θ r = (θ1r , θ2r ,
r
α , γ r ). The conditional expectation is given by E[Y r |X] =
E[Y r |Y r > 0, X] · Pr(Y r > 0|X), implying the moment conditions:

These moment conditions identify
given estimates of
for
the propensity scores.
Because observations are independent across individuals but
not over time, for estimating standard errors of θ̂ r it is convenient to stack all the observations for the different months for
the same individual in a vector of moment conditions. Yet for
only some of those months will an individual have been in a
choice-relevant situation, as indicated by the variable Sj t . The
moment condition for individual j in month t is then
mrj t = mr (Zj t , θ r ; β r )

where Zj t = (Yj t , Dj t , Xj t , Wj t , Sj t ) contains all the data for
individual i in month j , with
E[mr (Zj t , θ0r ; β0r ) |Xj t ] = 0.
Stacking the moment conditions for the 27 months (since the
pilot study took place during spring, summer, and autumn only,
the winter months December, January, and February have been
left out to avoid modeling the winter seasonal effects for the
different professions, leaving 27 months for each individual)
for the same individual gives
mrj = mr (Zj , θ r ; β r ) = (mrj 1 , . . . , mrj 27 ) ,

(9)

where Zj = (Zj 1 , . . . , Zj 27 ). Assuming strict exogeneity of
Xj t gives
E[mr (Zj , θ0r ; β0r ) |Xj ] = 0,
where Xj = (Xj 1 , . . . , Xj 27 ). The vectors mrj are independent
across individuals, and results for GMM estimators with iid
data apply. Taking β0r as given (as it is just identified from the
logit specification of the propensity score), the optimal unconditional moment function is

with
E[g r (Zj , θ0r ; β0r )] = 0;
see Newey and McFadden (1994). The GMM 
estimator chooses
gjr to 0. Notice
θ r to set the mean of the moment function N1
that the first two terms in (10) represent some kind of weighting
matrix, which only affects efficiency—the consistency of the
estimator does not depend on the weights.
To characterize this weighting matrix further, notice that the
first term is the expected gradient of the moment function. For
the particular function (9), it follows that
 r
∂mr (Zj , θ0r ; β0r )
∂m (Zj , θ0r ; β0r )

where estimators of θ0r and β0r can be plugged in. The second
term in (10) is the conditional covariance matrix of the moment function and is more difficult to obtain. With the large
number of covariates X, nonparametric estimation of the conditional covariance would be computationally very expensive.
We tried various alternatives, which did not affect the results
very much. A simple ad hoc choice is the following. Because
consistent estimation of this term is only needed for efficiency
but not for consistency, one can expect to obtain consistent and
relatively efficient estimates if the main features of the covariance matrix of (9) are incorporated in the estimator: Moment
functions that have a large variance should receive less weight,
and moment functions with a small variance should receive a
larger weight. Because the variance of mrj t largely depends on
the term p r (X, W ), which appears in the denominator, the variance will be large if p r (X, W ) is small. Therefore, the contributions of mrj t should be downweighted if p r (X, W ) is small.
Because formula (10) refers to the conditional variance given X
and not given X and W , we use the logit to estimate the probability
ρ r (x) = Pr(D = r|X = x).
Observations with small estimated ρ r (Xj t ) are downweighted
by multiplying the moment function by exp(−.02/ρ r (Xj t )).
Let P r (Xj ) be the 54 × 54 diagonal matrix containing the
weighting factors exp(−.02/ρ r (Xj t )) for every month, that is,

see Table 3. Treatment 5 (further training), on the other hand,
was received only by 183 observations, and treatment 4 (computer skills training) by 454 observations. These small sample
sizes are the result of having restricted the estimation sample
to only those observations living in Basel and, thus, sharing the
same local labor market and the same unemployment insurance
administration. This is the price one pays when taking local
differences in implementation and labor market conditions seriously. Most of these treatments start within the first year of
unemployment, with the exception of treatment 6 (employment
programs), which is rarely administered early in the unemployment spell (i.e., for a job search duration of less than 90 days).
Regarding the outcome variable Y , the observed number of
months in stable employment is 0 for about two-thirds of the
observations and about half a year for the others.
Table 4 shows descriptive statistics of the estimated probabilities p r (X, W ). These probabilities represent the channel
through which the W variables enter the estimation process.
Because p r enters inversely in the estimation equation, there is
a concern that very small values of p̂ r lead to large variances
for the estimates of θ r . Table 4 shows that this turned out to
be unimportant here because only 10 of the 46,406 observations needed to be capped. The first column shows the mean of
p̂ r among all observations. The following columns concentrate
on the distribution of p̂ r among the Dj = r observations only,
because the values of p̂jr for observations with Dj = r are multiplied by 0 in the estimation. The mean of p̂ r and the quantiles
of p̂ r relative to the mean are given. The last column shows that

mr (Zj , θ ; β̂ r ) P r (Xj )mr (Zj , θ ; β̂ r ).

For inference on θ̂ r and, thus, for deriving sets of optimal
treatment choices via MCB, the variance matrix of the firststep estimate of θ̂ r needs to be estimated. Here, the first-step
estimation of β r needs to be accounted for. This can be done
conveniently using the framework of Newey and McFadden
(1994, sec. 6.2). The first-step maximum likelihood estimator
β̂ r is equivalent to the just-identified GMM estimator using the
scores of the log-likelihood function as moment conditions


 
E Sj t 1(Dj t = r) − (Xj t β̂xr + Wj t β̂wr ) (Xj t , Wj t ) = 0.
Stacking these moment conditions on top of the moment conditions mrj , the joint variance matrix of all moment conditions
can be estimated as the outer product of the gradients. From
this, the asymptotic variance of θ̂ r can be obtained according to
Newey and McFadden (1994, sec. 6.2). Similarly, we can derive
the joint variance matrix for all θ̂ 1 , . . . , θ̂ R , which is needed for
inference on the estimated best program.
4.2 Estimation Results
Tables 3–6 give some details about the estimations for Basel.
The sample contained 8,796 unemployed persons with nonGerman mother tongue registered in Basel, corresponding to
46,406 panel observations in choice-relevant situations, of
which more than 40,000 received treatment 1 (no program);

NOTE: The last column gives the number of observations where p̂jr t was capped in the estimations. The estimated p̂jr t were capped at .02 of the mean of the propensity scores in the
D = r subpopulation. In other words, values of the ratio of p̂jr t to the mean below .02 are increased to .02. In the table the inverse of this ratio is given. Hence, values of this ratio above
50 are capped at 50.

for only 10 observations was the value of p̂jr capped in the estimator, and that the 99% percentile was below 20 for almost all
treatments.
These estimated coefficients θ̂ r are used in the next section to
predict employment chances for new clients in the pilot study.
Before this, the following tables provide a casual inspection of
the predictions for the previous 46,406 observations. Table 5
shows the correlations among the predicted E[Y r |X] for the
46,406 observations. As expected, all outcomes are positively
correlated with the “no program” outcome E[Y 1 |X]. The correlations are far from 1, however, which is an indication of treatment effect heterogeneity and may imply that the optimal treatment is different for different people.
4.3 Prediction of Best Treatment Choices
Given the estimates θ̂ 1 , . . . , θ̂ R and their estimated variances,
expected employment outcomes can be predicted for new unemployed persons. This system was piloted from May/June to
December 2005 in 21 employment offices in Switzerland. Predictions were made biweekly for all registered job seekers in
the pilot offices. When predicting the employment chances for
job seeker i, the current information up to time t was taken into
account in Xit .
The predicted employment chances for individual i in the R
treatments, that is, Ŷi1 , . . . , ŶiR , are computed from θ̂ 1 , . . . , θ̂ R ,
and the set of best treatments Ŝi and of worst treatments is derived by MCB. The information provided to the caseworker is
in the following form:

where the programs in the set Ŝi are boldface and the programs
with strictly positive lower bound (L̂i,r > 0) are set in a smaller
font.
Table 6 shows the results for the 2,303 job seekers registered
in Basel city on August 23, 2006. The first five rows give descriptive statistics of the predictions of Ŷ r for the 2,303 job
seekers. With an average outcome Ŷ 1 of 2.7 months, treatment
1 (no program) is the best of all treatments on average, whereas

treatment 3 (language skills training) is worst on average with
only 2 months of expected employment. In fact, treatment 1
also seems to be best at different quantiles of the distributions
of Ŷ r . This does not imply, however, that treatment 1 is best for
everyone because predictions are not perfectly rank correlated.
This is visible in the next row, where each job seeker is hypothetically allocated to the treatment with highest prediction.
Here it can be seen that treatment 5 (further training) is predicted to be best for 25% of all clients, and treatment 3 (language skills training) is predicted to be best for 10% of all
clients. This allocation was based entirely on the predicted outcomes Ŷir and ignored any estimation uncertainty. The row below shows the allocation that would arise if everyone were allocated randomly to a treatment within the estimated set Ŝi .
Finally, the last rows show the cardinality of the sets of “best”
treatments Ŝi , “worst” treatments (i.e., those with L̂i,r > 0), and
“intermediate” treatments (i.e., those that belong to neither of
the other two sets). For 781 of the 2,303 job seekers (=40%),
the cardinality of Ŝi is 1; that is, there is a single treatment
that is uniquely predicted to be the best. For 683 persons, Ŝi
contains two treatments. On the other hand, for 11 persons, Ŝi
contains all six treatments, and for 65 persons, Ŝi contains five
treatments. For these persons, no helpful guidances is given.
Overall, this indicates that the statistical system often provides
statistically useful predictions, but not for all clients.
5. CONCLUSIONS
In this article a methodology for statistical treatment choice
and its implementation has been described. The methodology
has two advantages over available targeting systems. First, it
permits one to combine a dataset on previously treated individuals with a dataset on new clients when the regressors available
in these two datasets do not coincide. It thereby incorporates
additional information on previously treated clients that is not
available for the current clients. Such a situation often arises
because of cost considerations, data confidentiality reasons, or
time delays in data availability. Second, statistical inference on
the recommended treatment choice is analyzed and conveyed to
the caseworker in an intelligible and transparent way. We use a
GMM approach to obtain joint inference on all programs when
propensity scores are unknown and have been estimated. By
stacking all moment functions, one can conveniently account
for statistical dependence between the estimates for the various
treatments.

APPENDIX: PROOF OF THEOREM 1

We want to show that

Y · 1(D = r)
.

(A.1)

First, it is shown that
E[Y · 1(D = r)|X, W ] = E[Y |X, W, D = r] Pr(D = r|X, W )
= E[Y r |X, W ] Pr(D = r|X, W ),
where the last equality follows from the conditional independence assumption (1). Hence,

Y · 1(D = r)
X, W = E[Y r |X, W ],
E
p r (X, W )
and it follows that


Y · 1(D = r)
X = E[Y r |X].
E
p r (X, W )

(A.2)

Now consider the second term in (A.1), which can be written as

2
Y · 1(D = r)
− ϕ(X; θ )
E
r
p (X, W )

2
Y · 1(D = r)

+ 2E
p r (X, W )

2

+ E E[Y r |X] − ϕ(X; θ ) .
The first term does not depend on the coefficients θ and, thus, does
not affect the minimizer of the entire expression. The second term is 0
by iterated expectations and (A.2). Only the third term remains, which
proves the equality of Theorem 1.
