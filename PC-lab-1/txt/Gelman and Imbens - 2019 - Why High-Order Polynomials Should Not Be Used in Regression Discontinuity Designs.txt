It is common in regression discontinuity analysis to control for third, fourth, or higher-degree polynomials
of the forcing variable. There appears to be a perception that such methods are theoretically justified,
even though they can lead to evidently nonsensical results. We argue that controlling for global high-order
polynomials in regression discontinuity analysis is a flawed approach with three major problems: it leads
to noisy estimates, sensitivity to the degree of the polynomial, and poor coverage of confidence intervals.
We recommend researchers instead use estimators based on local linear or quadratic polynomials or other
smooth functions.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Controlling for the Forcing Variable in Regression
Discontinuity Analysis
Causal inference is central to science, and identification strategies in observational studies are central to causal inference in
aspects of social and natural sciences when experimentation
is not possible. Regression discontinuity designs are a longstanding (going back to Thistlewaite and Campbell 1960), and
recently increasingly popular, way to get credible causal estimates when applicable. But implementations of regression discontinuity inference vary considerably in the literature, with
many researchers controlling for high-degree polynomials of
the underlying continuous forcing variable. In this note, we
make the case that global high-order polynomial regressions
have poor properties and argue that they should not be used in
these settings.
There are three, somewhat related, reasons why we think that
high-order polynomial regressions are a poor choice in regression discontinuity analyses:
1. An estimate based on a polynomial regression, with or without trimming, can be interpreted as the difference between
a weighted average of the outcomes for the treated minus a
weighted average of the outcomes for the controls. Given
the choice of estimator, the weights depend only on the
threshold and the values of the forcing variable, not on the
values for the outcomes. One can, and should in applications, inspect these weights. We find that doing so in some
applications suggests that the weights implied by higherorder polynomial regressions can take on extreme, prima
facie unattractive, values, relative to the weights based on
local linear or quadratic regressions.

2. Results for the causal effects of interest based on global
high-order polynomial regressions are sensitive to the
order of the polynomial. Moreover, we do not have good
methods for choosing that order in a way that is optimal
for the objective of a good estimator for the causal effect of
interest. Often researchers choose the order by optimizing
some global goodness-of-fit measure (e.g., the methods
suggested by Fan and Gijbels 1996), but that is not closely
related to the research objective of causal inference.
3. Inference based on high-order polynomials is often poor.
Specifically, confidence intervals based on such regressions,
taking the polynomial as an accurate approximation to the
conditional expectation, are often misleading. Even if there
is no discontinuity in the regression function, high-order
polynomial regressions can lead to confidence intervals that
fail to include zero with probability higher than the nominal
Type 1 error rate.
Based on these arguments we recommend researchers not use
such methods, and instead control for local linear or quadratic
polynomials or other smooth functions.
1.2 Theoretical Framework
Regression discontinuity analysis has enjoyed a renaissance in
social science, especially in economics, as a credible way of
estimating causal effects in settings where unconfoundedness

is not plausible; Imbens and Lemieux (2008), Van Der Klaauw
(2008), Lee and Lemieux (2010), DiNardo and Lee (2010), and
Skovron and Titiunik (2015) provide recent reviews.
Regression discontinuity analyses are used to estimate the
causal effect of a binary treatment on some outcome. Using the
potential outcome approach (e.g., Imbens and Rubin 2015), let
(yi (0), yi (1)) denote the pair of potential outcomes for unit i and
let wi ∈ {0, 1} denote the treatment. The realized outcome is
= yi (wi ). Although the same issues arise in fuzzy regresyobs
i
sion discontinuity designs, for ease of exposition we focus on
the sharp case, where the treatment received is a monotone,
deterministic, function of a pretreatment variable xi , the forcing
variable, with the threshold equal to zero:
wi = 1xi ≥ 0 .
Define
τ (x) = E(yi (1) − yi (0)|xi = x).
Regression discontinuity methods focus on estimating the
average effect of the treatment at the threshold (equal to zero
here):
τ = τ (0).
Under some conditions, mainly smoothness of the conditional
expectations of the potential outcomes as a function of the forcing variable, this average effect can be estimated as the discontinuity in the conditional expectation of yobs
as a function of the
i
forcing variable, at the threshold:
obs
τ = lim E(yobs
i |xi = x) − lim E(yi |xi = x).
x↓0

x↑0

The question is how to estimate the two limits of the regression function at the threshold:
μ+ = lim E(yobs
i |xi = x),

and μ− = lim E(yobs
i |xi = x).

x↓0

2. ARGUMENT 1: NOISY WEIGHTS

x↑0

We focus in this note on two approaches researchers
have commonly taken to estimating μ+ and μ− . Typically
researchers are not confident that the two conditional means
and μ− (x) = E(yobs
μ+ (x) = E(yobs
i |xi = x, x > 0)
i |xi = x,
x < 0) can be well approximated by a global linear function.
One approach researchers have taken is to use a global highorder polynomial approach. Lee and Lemieux (2008) write:
“From an applied perspective, a simple way of relaxing the
linearity assumption is to include polynomial functions of x
in the regression model.” In this approach, researchers choose
some integer K, possibly in a data-dependent way, and estimate
the regression function,
=
yobs
i

The second commonly used approach is local linear or sometimes local quadratic approximation. In that case, researchers
discard the units with xi more than some bandwidth h away from
the threshold and estimate a linear or quadratic function on the
remaining units; see Hahn, Todd, and Van Der Klaauw (2001)
and Porter (2003). Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012) suggested
a data driven way for choosing the bandwidth in connection with
a local linear specification. Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik
(2014) suggested an algorithm for a data-dependent bandwidth
with a quadratic specification for the regression function.
Although in determining the bandwidth, researchers often use
global polynomial approximations to the regression function,
because the final results are based on local estimation, they tend
to be less sensitive to the choices of the polynomial order than
estimates directly based on global high-order polynomials.
The main point of the current article is that we think the
approach based on high-order global polynomial approximations should not be used, and that instead, inference based on
local low-order polynomials (local linear or local quadratic)
is to be preferred. In the next three sections, we discuss three
arguments in support of this position and illustrate these in the
context of some applications. We should note that these are not
formal results. If a researcher is confident that the conditional
means can be described with sufficient accuracy by a fifth-order
polynomial, than that would be a perfectly sensible method
to use. However, in practice it is unlikely that a researcher is
confident about this, and the approximation results available
for polynomial approximations do not imply that in practical
settings these methods will lead to reasonable results. We will
attempt to make the case that in fact, they do not, and that local
methods do better in empirically relevant settings.

on the N+ units with values xi ≥ 0 and repeat the same procedure using the N− units with values xi < 0. The discontinuity in
the value of the regression function at zero is then estimated as
τ̂ = μ̂+ − μ̂− = β̂+0 − β̂−0 .
In practice, researchers often use up to fifth or sixth-order
polynomials, often using statistical information criteria or crossvalidation to choose the degree K of the polynomial.

Our first argument against using global high-order polynomial methods focuses on the interpretation of linear estimators
for the causal estimand as weighted averages. More precisely,
these estimators can be written as the difference between the
weighted averages of the outcomes for the treated and controls,
with the weights a function of the forcing variable. This is
true for both global and local polynomial methods, and we can
therefore base comparisons of these methods on the form and
values of these weights. We show that for global polynomial
methods these weights can have unattractive properties. This
is related to what is known in the approximation literature as
Runge’s phenomenon, that given a set of N pairs (xi , yi ) on
a compact interval [a, b], the N − 1th-order polynomial that
goes through all the pairs becomes increasingly erratic, as
the number of points increases, close to the boundary of the
interval, especially when there are relatively few points close to
the boundary (Dahlquist and Bjork 1974). See also Calonico,
Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2015).
2.1 The Weighted Average Representation of
Polynomial Regressions
The starting point is that polynomial regressions, whether global
or local, lead to estimators for μ+ and μ− that can be written as

Gelman and Imbens: Why High-Order Polynomials Should Not Be Used in Regression Discontinuity Designs

weighted averages. Focusing on μ̂+ , the estimator for μ+ , we
can write μ̂+ as a weighted average of outcomes for units with
xi ≥ 0:
μ̂+ =

1 
wi yobs
i ,
N+ i:x ≥0
i

where the weights wi have been normalized to have a mean of 1
over all N+ units with a value of the forcing variable exceeding
the threshold. The weights are an estimator-specific function of
the full set of values x1 , . . . , xN for the forcing variable that does
obs
not depend on the outcome values yobs
1 , . . . , yN . Hence, we can
write the weights as
(w1 , . . . , wn ) = w(x1 , . . . , xN ).
The various estimators differ in the way the weights depend
on value of the forcing variable. Moreover, we can inspect, for a
given estimator, the functional form for the weights. Suppose we
estimate a Kth-order polynomial approximation using all units
with xi less than the bandwidth h (where h can be ∞ so that this
includes global polynomial regressions).
 Then, the weight for
unit i in the estimation of μ+ , μ̂+ = i:xi ≥0 wi yobs
i /N+ , is

where eK+1,1 is the K + 1-component column vector with all
elements other than the first equal to zero, and the first element
equal to one.
There are two important features of these weights. First, the
values of the weights have nothing to do with the actual shape
of the conditional expectation function, whether it is constant,
linear, or anything else. Second, one can inspect these weights
based on the values of the forcing variable in the sample, and
compare them for different estimators. In particular, we can
compare, before seeing the outcome data, the weights for different values of the bandwidth h and the order of the polynomial K.

2.2 Example: Matsudaira Data
To illustrate, we first inspect the weights for various estimators
for an analysis by Matsudaira (2008) of the effect of a remedial summer program on subsequent academic achievement.
Students were required to participate in the summer program
if they score below a threshold on either a mathematics or a
reading test, although not all students did so, making this a
fuzzy regression discontinuity design. We focus here on the
discontinuity in the outcome variable, which can be interpreted
as an intention-to-treat estimate. There are 68,798 students
in the sample. The forcing variable is the minimum of the
mathematics and reading test scores normalized so that the
threshold equals 0. Its range is [−199, 168]. The outcome we
look at here is the subsequent mathematics score. There are
22,892 students with the minimum of the test scores below the
threshold, and 45,906 with a test score above.
In this section, we discuss estimation of μ+ only. Estimation
of μ− raises the same issues. We look at weights for various
estimators. First, we consider global polynomials up to sixthdegree. Second, we consider local linear methods. The bandwidth for the local linear regression is 25.4, calculated using
the Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012) bandwidth selector. This
leaves 20,441 individuals whose value for the forcing variable is
positive and less than 25.4, out of the 45,906 with positive values
for the forcing variable. We estimate the local linear regression
using a triangular kernel.
Figures 1(a)–(c) and Table 1 present some of the results relevant for the discussion on the weights. Figure 1(a) gives the
weights for the six global polynomial regressions, as a function
of the forcing variable. Figure 1(b) gives the weights for the
local linear regression with rectangular and triangular kernels,
and the bandwidth equal to 25.4, again as a function of the forcing variable. Figure 1(c) presents a histogram of the distribution
of the forcing variable for individuals with a value for the forcing variable greater than 0. In Table 1, we present the weights
for the individuals with the largest value for the forcing variable, xi = 168, for the six polynomial regression specifications.
Because this extreme value of 168 is outside the bandwidth, the
weight for the local linear regression for individuals with such
a value for xi would be 0. Recall that the average value of the
weights is 1 for individuals with a value of the forcing variable
exceeding zero.
Figure 1(a) shows that the weight for the individuals with
large values for the forcing variable are quite sensitive to the

order of the polynomial. Based on these figures, we would not
be comfortable with any of these six specifications. Figure 1(b)
shows the weights for the local linear regression, which appear
more attractive: most of the weight goes to the individuals
with values for xi close to the threshold, and individuals with
xi > 25.4 have weights of 0.
Table 1 also shows the unattractiveness of the high-order
polynomial regressions. Whereas one would like to give little or zero weight to the individuals with extreme values for
xi , the global polynomial regressions attach large weights,
sometimes positive, sometimes negative, to these individuals,
and often substantially larger than the average weight of one,
whereas the local linear estimator attaches zero weight to these
individuals.

2.3 Jacob–Lefgren Data
In Figures 2(a)–(c), we repeat these analyses for another dataset.
Here, the interest is also in the causal effect of a summer school
program. The data were previously analyzed by Jacob and
Lefgren (2004). There are observations on 70,831 students.
The forcing variable is the minimum of a mathematics and
reading test, with the range equal to [−0.9, 6.8]. Out of the
70,831 students, 29,900 score below the threshold of 2.75 on
at least one of the tests, and so are required to participate in the
summer program. The Imbens–Kalyanaraman bandwidth here
is 0.51. As a result, the local polynomial estimators are based on
26,180 individuals out of the full sample of 70,831, with 12,580
required and 13,600 not required to participate in summer
school. Again, the weights for the individuals with large values
for the forcing variable are quite sensitive to the order of the
polynomial.

In Figures 3(a)–(c), we repeat these analysis for a third dataset,

one party winning an election on the voting shares in the next
election, using data from congressional district elections. The
Imbens–Kalyanaraman bandwidth here is 0.34. There are 3818
elections where the Democrats won, and 2740 where the Republicans won. Again, we find that the weights far from the threshold can be quite sensitive to the order of the polynomial chosen

to approximate the regression function. An additional feature of
these data is that there are a fair number of elections that are
uncontested, which clearly should have low weight in estimating the effect for close elections.
2.5 General Recommendation
Most, if not all, estimators for average treatment effects used in
practice can be written as the difference between two weighted
averages, one for the treated units and one for the control units.
This includes estimators in regression discontinuity settings. In
those cases, it is useful to inspect the weights in the weighted
average expression for the estimators to assess whether some
units receive excessive weight in the estimators.
3. ARGUMENT 2: ESTIMATES THAT ARE HIGHLY
SENSITIVE TO THE DEGREE OF THE POLYNOMIAL
The second argument against the high-order global polynomial regressions is their sensitivity to the order of the
polynomial. We illustrate that here using three applications of
regression discontinuity designs.
3.1 Matsudaira Data
We return to the Matsudaira data. Here, we use the outcome data
and directly estimate the effect of the treatment on the outcome

for units close to the threshold. To simplify the exposition,
we look at the effect of not being required to attend summer
school, rather than actual attendance, analyzing the data as a
sharp, rather than a fuzzy, regression discontinuity design. We
consider global polynomials up to order six and local polynomials up to order two. The bandwidth is 25.4 for the local
polynomial estimators, based on the Imbens–Kalyanaraman
bandwidth selector, leaving 33,956 individuals in the sample.
Local linear or quadratic regression is based on a triangular
kernel.
The first two numerical columns in Table 2 display the point
estimates and standard errors. The variation in the global polynomial estimates over the six specifications is much bigger than
the standard error for any of these six estimates, suggesting that
the standard errors do not capture the full amount of uncertainty
about the causal effects of interest. The estimates based on
third-, fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-order global polynomials range
from −0.112 to −0.069, whereas the range for the local linear
and quadratic estimates is −0.078 to −0.064, substantially
narrower.
For the Matsudaira data, we also present in Figures 4(a) and
4(b) the estimated regression functions based on the various
specifications. From those figures, there appears to be relatively
little difference between the estimated regression functions
over most of the range of values where the observations are.
Nevertheless, these small differences matter for the estimated
difference in the two regression functions.

3.2 Jacob–Lefgren and Lee Data
We repeat these analyses for the Jacob–Lefgren and Lee
datasets. The second pair of numerical columns in Table 2
reports the corresponding estimates for the Jacob–Lefgren
dataset. Again, the estimates based on the global polynomials
have a wider range than the local linear and quadratic estimates.
The third pair of numerical columns in Table 2 reports the corresponding estimates for the Lee congressional election dataset.
Here, the estimated effect based on a third order polynomial
is 0.111, almost three times that based on a fifth-order polynomial, 0.043. The local linear and local quadratic estimates are
substantially closer, 0.082 and 0.070.

4. ARGUMENT 3: INFERENCES THAT DO NOT
ACHIEVE NOMINAL COVERAGE
Our third point is that conventional inference for treatment
effects in regression discontinuity settings can be misleading,

0.018
0.028

0.008
0.011

in the sense that conventional confidence intervals have lower
than nominal coverage. We make that point by constructing confidence intervals for discontinuities in an artificial setting, where
we expect no discontinuities to be present.
We illustrate this point with two different datasets. The first
contains information on yearly earnings in 1974, 1975, and
1978 for 15,992 individuals for whom there is information
from the Current Population Survey. (These data were previously used for different purposes in work by Lalonde (1986)
and Dehejia and Wahba (1999).) We look at the conditional
expectation of earnings in 1978 in thousands of dollars (the
outcome yi ) given the average of earnings in 1974 and 1975
(the predictor xi , in thousands of dollars so that the coefficients
of the higher powers are on a reasonable scale). Figure 5(a)
gives a simple, histogram-based estimate of the conditional
expectation, with a histogram of the marginal distribution of
the conditioning variable in Figure 5(b). Unsurprisingly, the
conditional expectation looks fairly smooth and increasing.
Overlaid with the histogram estimator are a first to sixth-order
polynomial approximations, with all approximations other than

the sixth-order one in dashes, and the sixth-order one in a solid
line. All approximations appear fairly accurate.
Now suppose we pretend the median of the average of earnings in 1974 and 1975 (equal to 14.65) was the threshold, and
we estimate the discontinuity in the conditional expectation of
earnings in 1978. We would expect to find an estimate close to
zero. Doing so, for global and local polynomials of different
degree, we find the estimates in Table 3.
All estimates are in fact reasonably close to zero, with
the nominal 95% confidence interval in most cases including
zero. This exercise on its own is not particularly informative,
because the estimates based on the different specifications are
highly correlated. However, in the next step we assess whether
the coverage found for this single case is typical. We do the
following exercise. 20,000 times we randomly pick a single
point from the empirical distribution of xi between the 0.25

and 0.75 quantile that will serve as a pseudo threshold. We
pretend this randomly drawn value of xi is the threshold in a
regression discontinuity design analysis. In each of the 20,000
replications, we then draw M = 1000 individuals randomly
from the full sample of 15,992 individuals. Given this sample
of size 1000 and the randomly chosen threshold we then estimate the average effect of the pseudo-treatment, its standard
error, and check whether the implied 95% confidence interval
excludes zero. There is no reason to expect a discontinuity
in this conditional expectation at these threshold, and so we
should see that only 5% of the times we randomly pick a threshold the corresponding confidence interval should not include
zero.
We do this exercise for the six global and the two local polynomial regressions. If, say, the regression functions on both
sides of the threshold are truly linear, than the estimator based

on linearity should be approximately unbiased for the average
treatment effect (which is zero here), and the corresponding
95% confidence interval should include zero 95% of the time.
If, on the other hand, the regression function is not truly linear,

the confidence intervals based on linearity are likely to include
the true value of zero less than 95% of the time. For the local
linear and local quadratic regressions, we drop observations
with values of x more than h away from the threshold (where
the distance h is chosen using the Imbens–Kalyanaram bandwidth procedure). The results are in Table 4. The rejection
rates for the global polynomials are substantially above the
nominal rejection rate of 5%. In contrast the rejection rates for
the local linear and local quadratic estimators are fairly close
to the nominal rejection rate. Moreover, the median standard
errors for the global estimators are substantially larger than
the standard errors for the local estimators. Thus, the global
estimators combine large standard errors with under coverage
for the confidence intervals, so that clearly the local polynomial
estimators are superior in this setting.
We repeat this exercise for a second dataset. In this exercise, we use a census data and consider the regression of
years of education on earnings. This has the advantage that
the dataset is large, and the forcing variable is close to

be much higher than 5%, especially for the global fits

continuous. Substantively of course the regression is not of
interest. However, qualitatively we find the same results: the
global polynomial methods combine relatively poor coverage
rates with substantially larger standard errors.
5. DISCUSSION
Regression discontinuity designs have become increasingly
popular in social sciences in the last 20 years as a credible
method for obtaining causal estimates. One implementation
relies on using global high-order polynomial approximations
to the conditional expectation of the outcome given the forcing
variable. Such models can give poor results in practice (see
discussion from Gelman and Zelizer 2015). This motivates the
present article in which we lay out the specific problems with
the method and why we recommend against using high-order
polynomials in regression discontinuity analyses. We present
three arguments for this position: the implicit weights for highorder polynomial approximations are not attractive, the results
are sensitive to the order of the polynomial approximation, and
conventional inference has poor properties in these settings. We
recommend that instead researchers use local low-order polynomial methods (local linear or local quadratic) as discussed
by Hahn, Todd, and VanderKlaauw (2001), Porter (2003), and
Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014). In addition, we recommend that researchers routinely present the implicit weights
in the estimates of the causal estimands.
We present the arguments in the context of sharp regression discontinuity designs. The same arguments apply to fuzzy
regression discontinuity designs, where we would recommend
using local linear or quadratic methods for both the outcome and
treatment received. In regression kink designs (e.g., Card et al.
2015, Dong 2010), where the focus is on estimating a derivative of, rather than the level of the regression function at a point,
one may wish to use local quadratic methods. The results in this
article suggest that such approaches would be superior to using
global polynomial approximations.
Given all these problems, as well as the non-intuitive nature
of high-degree polynomial fits, the natural question arises: what
was the appeal of high-degree polynomials in the first place? We
suspect this comes from three sources. First, the fact that highorder polynomials can approximate any smooth function on a
compact set arbitrarily well. While true, this does not address the
issue that a high-order polynomial based on least square fit may
not give a good approximation, especially close to the boundary. Second, in many of the paradigmatic examples of regression
discontinuity analysis, the relation between the forcing variable
and the outcome is very strong, so that even when a high-degree
polynomial is fit to data, that fit is smooth and monotonic, in
which case such polynomials can do less damage than they can
in examples where the forcing variable is not a good predictor at
all (as discussed in Gelman and Zelizer 2015). The third implicit
justification for high-degree polynomials, we suspect, is the recommendation given in many textbooks that, when performing
causal inference, it is safest to include as many pre-treatment
background variables as possible. The idea is that including relevant predictors should reduce bias, while including noise predictors will only induce slight increases in variance due to reduction in degrees of freedom. Thus when sample size is large, it can
seem safe to include high-degree polynomial terms on the right

hand side of the regression—especially if the coefficient on the
discontinuity term is statistically significant, in which case the
cost in increased variance would seem, in retrospect, minor in
comparison to the gain in safety from including the more flexible predictor set. The flaw in this reasoning is that polynomials of the forcing term are not simply noise predictors and can
induce bias as well as variance, thus damaging coverage, as discussed in Section 4 of our article.
