We propose a difference-in-differences approach for disentangling a total treatment effect within specific
subpopulations into a direct effect and an indirect effect operating through a binary mediating variable.
Random treatment assignment along with specific common trend and effect homogeneity assumptions
identify the direct effects on the always and never takers, whose mediator is not affected by the treatment,
as well as the direct and indirect effects on the compliers, whose mediator reacts to the treatment. In
our empirical application, we analyze the impact of the Vietnam draft lottery on political preferences.
The results suggest that a high draft risk due to the draft lottery outcome leads to an increase in mild
preferences for the Republican Party, but has no effect on strong preferences for either party or on specific
political attitudes. The increase in Republican support is mostly driven by the direct effect not operating
through the mediator that is military service.

1. INTRODUCTION

DiD method in addition tackles mediator endogeneity within
subpopulations. To this end, we assume that the mean potential
outcomes for specific treatment–mediator combinations evolve
in the same way over time across specific subpopulations (rather
than across treatment groups as in standard DiD).
In contrast to our approach, a good part of the literature on
causal mediation analysis assumes conditional exogeneity of the
treatment (given observed covariates) and the mediator (given
the treatment and the covariates), which requires observing all
confounders of the treatment and the mediator. Such “sequential ignorability” was for instance imposed by Petersen, Sinisi
and van der Laan (2006); Flores and Flores-Lagunes (2009);
VanderWeele (2009); Imai, Keele, and Yamamoto (2010); Hong
(2010); Tchetgen Tchetgen and Shpitser (2012); Zheng and van
der Laan (2012); and Huber (2014). Alternatively, relatively few
contributions consider identification based on instruments, see,
for instance, Imai, Tingley, and Yamamoto (2013), Yamamoto
(2013), and Frölich and Huber (2014). Our article is to the best
of our knowledge the first one to offer an alternative to sequential ignorability and instrumental variable assumptions and to
propose identification based on a DiD approach in the context
of mediation analysis.
While most mediation studies focus on the total population,
comparably few contributions discuss effects in subpopulations

Treatment or policy interventions causally affect an outcome
of interest through various mechanisms. An example is the Vietnam draft lottery in the U.S. It might have affected outcomes
such as political preferences or personal income later in life
through military service during the Vietnam War, or college
deferments to avoid conscription. Causal mediation analysis
(Robins and Greenland 1992; Pearl 2001; Robins 2003) intends
to disentangle the direct effect of some treatment on an outcome
from the indirect effects operating through intermediate variables, called mediators.
The main contribution of this article is a difference-indifferences (DiD) approach under random treatment assignment
that separates direct and indirect effects. We do so within subpopulations which are defined based on how/whether a binary
mediator reacts to treatment assignment. Our approach identifies the so-called principal stratum direct and indirect effects
(see Rubin 2004; VanderWeele 2008). Borrowing from the
nomenclature in Angrist, Imbens and Rubin (1996), we present
assumptions that allow assessing direct effects for “always”
and “never takers,” whose binary mediator is (independently of
the treatment) either always or never equal to one, as well as
direct and indirect effects on the “compliers,” whose mediator
value always corresponds to the treatment. For identification,
random treatment assignment, monotonicity of the mediator in
the treatment, common trend restrictions, and effect homogeneity assumptions are imposed. While random treatment assignment alone only permits evaluating the total treatment effect, our

(or principal strata, see Frangakis and Rubin 2002), which are
defined upon the value of the binary mediator as a function of the
treatment, see, for instance, Rubin (2004). Principal stratification in the context of mediation has been criticized for typically
not permitting a decomposition of direct and indirect effects
among compliers and for focusing on subgroups that may be
less interesting than the entire population (see VanderWeele
2008; 2012). We contribute to this discussion by showing that
direct and indirect effects on compliers can be identified in a
DiD framework under particular conditions and by presenting
an empirical application in which the effect on subgroups is relevant for political decision making.
We use our method to investigate the effect of the Vietnam
draft lottery in the US on political preferences and attitudes.
The mediator is military service during the Vietnam War. Some
individuals (the compliers) were induced by the lottery to serve
either through being drafted or pre-emptively joining the military in case of a lottery outcome resulting in being drafted
(Angrist 1991), while others avoided the draft (never takers)
for example through college deferments (Card and Lemieux
2001; Kuziemko 2010; Deuchert and Huber 2017), or would
have served in any case (always takers). We estimate the direct
effect of the draft lottery on the never takers, as well as the direct
and indirect effects (via military service) on the compliers.
This is a particularly interesting application for several reasons: A recent literature argues that party preferences and political attitudes are endogenous to policy interventions, which is
in stark contrast to standard economic theory assuming stable
preferences. Erikson and Stoker (2011) estimated the impact of
the Vietnam draft lottery on party preferences and concluded
that a lottery outcome resulting in a higher risk of being drafted
increased the support for Democrats and strengthened liberal
attitudes. Bergan (2009) found that it also increased preferences
for an immediate withdrawal from Vietnam.
In contrast to these results, we find that the draft lottery
significantly increased the probability to at least mildly prefer
the Republican Party in the total population. When decomposing the average treatment effect into direct and indirect effects
within strata, we find statistically significant positive direct
effects on the probability to at least mildly prefer the Republican Party among compliers and never takers, but an insignificant
indirect effect among compliers. However, we find no effects on
Vietnam War attitudes, general attitudes toward the government,
or attitudes toward the Civil Rights Movement. Given that we
find no effects on the probability to strongly prefer a party, the
results are in line with a traditional swing voter interpretation, in
which citizens without a stable party attachment in the center of
the policy spectrum update their stated party preferences. Provided that we do not find evidence of changes in other measures
of policy preferences and attitudes, underlying personal preferences seem to be unaffected. Therefore, changes in stated party
preferences are more likely to result from perceived changes of
policy platforms offered by political parties rather than changes
of underlying preferences. Hence, in contrast to Erikson and
Stoker (2011) and Bergan (2009), our results are in line with
traditional microeconomic assumptions of stable preferences.
Our approach is also relevant from a practical perspective:
in the political process politicians formulate policy objectives
(e.g., to increase fairness of the military draft) and, based on
such objectives, define policy interventions (e.g., draft lottery).

Journal of Business & Economic Statistics, XXXX 2018

In that sense, the indirect effect (e.g., increasing fairness in
actual military service) is often the politically intended main
effect of a policy. However, in anticipation of individuals who
do not freely comply with policies (never takers), policymakers
also define complementary policies (e.g., limiting educational
deferment options or outright sanctions) in order to increase
compliance. Therefore, it is not only important to understand
the politically intended main effect of a policy (the “indirect
effect on compliers”), but also the side effects, such as the
“direct effects on compliers” as well as the effects on never takers (e.g., on those who are potentially sanctioned) and always
takers (who remain unaffected by the policy intervention).
The commonly considered local average treatment effect
(LATE) on compliers is equivalent to our indirect effect on
compliers. The LATE is conventionally estimated by instrumental variable methods (e.g., Angrist 1990; Angrist, Chen and
Frandsen 2010). The indirect effect estimated by our method
is 10 times lower and statistically significantly different from
the LATE. This suggests that the findings in the literature are
not robust across different methods based on common trend or
instrumental variable assumptions, respectively.
The remainder of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the econometric framework, that is, the effects
of interest and the identifying assumptions underlying our DiD
approach. Section 3 presents an empirical application to the
Vietnam draft lottery in which the total effects as well as the
direct and indirect effects on political preferences and personal
views on war and other governmental policies are estimated for
various strata. Section 4 concludes.
2. ECONOMETRIC FRAMEWORK
2.1 Notation and Definition of Direct and Indirect Effects
Let Z denote a binary treatment (e.g., being chosen for military
service in a draft lottery) and D a binary intermediate variable
or mediator that may be a function of Z (e.g., an indicator for
actual military service). Furthermore, let T indicate a particular
time period: T = 0 denotes the baseline period prior to assignment of Z and D, T = 1 the follow-up period after measuring D
and Z in which the effect of the outcome is evaluated. Finally, let
Yt denote the outcome of interest (e.g., political preference) in
period T = t. Indexing the outcome by the time period t ∈ {1, 0}
implies that it may be measured both in the baseline period and
after the assignment of Z and D. To define the parameters of
interest, we make use of the potential outcome notation, see, for
instance, Rubin (1974), and denote by Yt (z, d) the potential outcome for treatment state Z = z and mediator state D = d in time
T = t, with z, d, t ∈ {1, 0}. Furthermore, let D(z) denote the
potential mediator as a function of the treatment state z ∈ {1, 0}.
For notational ease, we will not use a time index for D and Z,
because each of these parameters is assumed to be measured
at a single period between T = 0 and T = 1 (but not necessarily the same period, as Z causally precedes D). Implicit in this
approach is that the treatment and the mediator are equal to zero
in or prior to the baseline period.
The average treatment effect (ATE) in the follow-up period
is defined as 1 = E[Y1 (1, D(1)) − Y1 (0, D(0))]. That is, the
ATE corresponds to the cumulative effect of Z on the outcome that either affects the latter directly (i.e., any effect not

Deuchert, Huber, and Schelker: Direct and Indirect Effects Based on Difference-in-Differences

running through the mediator) or indirectly through an effect
on D. Indeed, the total ATE can be split into so-called natural direct and indirect effects using the notation of Pearl
(2001),1 defined as θ1 (z) = E[Y1 (1, D(z)) − Y1 (0, D(z))] and
δ1 (z) = E[Y1 (z, D(1)) − Y1 (z, D(0))], by adding and subtracting Y1 (1, D(0)) or Y1 (0, D(1)):
1 = E [Y1 (1, D (1)) − Y1 (0, D (0))]
= E [Y1 (1, D (0)) − Y1 (0, D (0))]
+ E [Y1 (1, D (1)) − Y1 (1, D (0))] = θ1 (0) + δ1 (1)
= E [Y1 (1, D (1)) − Y1 (0, D (1))]
+ E [Y1 (0, D (1)) − Y1 (0, D (0))] = θ1 (1) + δ1 (0) .
Distinguishing between θ1 (1) and θ1 (0) or δ1 (1) and δ1 (0),
respectively, implies the possibility of interaction effects
between Z and D such that the effects could be heterogeneous
across values z = 1 and z = 0. For instance, δ1 (1) and δ1 (0)
might differ if the military unit (and war experience) an individual is assigned to when being chosen through the draft lottery is different than when joining the army voluntarily without
being drafted. This may have an impact on political attitudes.
Furthermore, note that if Z was a valid instrument for D that
satisfied the exclusion restriction, as for instance assumed in
Angrist (1990) in the context of the Vietnam draft lottery, any
direct effect θt (z) would be zero and the indirect effect would
simplify to δ1 (1) = δ1 (0) = δ1 . In our empirical application outlined below, we do not impose this strong assumption, but allow
for direct effects.2
In our approach, we consider the concepts of direct and indirect effects within subgroups or principal strata in the denomination of Frangakis and Rubin (2002) that are defined upon the
values of the potential mediator. As outlined by Angrist, Imbens,
and Rubin (1996) in the context of instrumental variable-based
identification, any individual i in the population belongs to one
of four strata, henceforth denoted by τ , according to their potential mediator status (now indexed by i) under either treatment
state: always takers (a : Di (1) = Di (0) = 1) whose mediator is
always one, compliers (c : Di (1) = 1, Di (0) = 0) whose mediator corresponds to the treatment value, defiers (d : Di (1) =
0, Di (0) = 1) whose mediator opposes the treatment value, and
never takers (n : Di (1) = Di (0) = 0) whose mediator is never
one. Note that τ cannot be pinned down for any individual,
because either Di (1) or Di (0) is observed, but never both.
Introducing further stratum-specific notation, let
τ1 = E[Y1 (1, D(1)) − Y1 (0, D(0))|τ ] denote the ATE given
τ ∈ {a, n, c, d}; θ1τ (z) and δ1τ (z) denote the corresponding
direct and indirect effects. Because Di (1) = Di (0) = 0 for
any never taker, the indirect effect for this group is by
definition zero (δ1n (z) = E[Y1 (z, 0) − Y1 (z, 0)|n] = 0) and
corn1 = E[Y1 (1, 0) − Y1 (0, 0)|n] = θ1n (1) = θ1n (0) = θ1n
responds to the direct effect (and an analogous argument
applies to the always takers). For the compliers, both
direct and indirect effects may exist. Note that D(z) = z
1 Robins

and Greenland (1992) and Robins (2003) referred to the parameters as
total or pure direct and indirect effects.

Huber (2017).

due to the definition of compliers. Therefore, θ1c (z) =
E[Y1 (1, z) − Y1 (0, z)|c] and δ1c (z) = E[Y1 (z, 1) − Y1 (z, 0)|c],
while c1 = E[Y1 (1, 1) − Y1 (0, 0)|c].3 Furthermore, in the
absence of any direct effects, the indirect effects on the compliers are homogenous, δ1c (1) = δ1c (0) = δ1c , and correspond to the
LATE, defined as the causal effect of D on Y among compliers.
2.2 Identifying Assumptions
We subsequently discuss the identifying assumptions along with
the effects that may be obtained.4 We start by assuming independence between the treatment and potential mediators or outcomes:
Assumption 1. Independence of Z and potential mediators/outcomes
{Yt (z, d) , D (z)} ⊥ Z, for all z, d, t ∈ {1, 0}
Assumption 1 implies that there are no confounders jointly
affecting the treatment and the mediator and/or outcome and
is satisfied under treatment randomization as in successfully
conducted experiments or (draft) lotteries. Our subsequent
identification results could easily be adjusted to the case that
independence only holds conditional on a vector of observed
covariates. However, for the sake of ease of notation, we do
not consider covariates and note that under conditional independence, any result holds within cells defined upon covariate
values.
Assumption 2. Weak monotonicity of D in Z
Pr (Di (1) ≥ Di (0)) = 1.
Assumption 2 is standard in the literature on local average treatment effects (see Imbens and Angrist 1994; Angrist,
Imbens and Rubin 1996) and rules out the existence of defiers.
Defiance seems to be a common behavior among children but
should not be a major concern when adults are faced with a life
changing decision, such as joining the army during war times
(as in our empirical application).
Assumption 3. No anticipation effect of D and Z in the baseline period

Assumption 3 rules out anticipation effects of the treatment
or the mediator w.r.t. the outcome in the baseline period. This
assumption seems plausible if assignment to treatment cannot
be foreseen, for example if assignment is the result of a lottery
as in our empirical application.
As shown in the online appendix, Assumptions 1–3 imply
that
E[Y0 (1, 1) − Y0 (0, 0)|c] = c0 = 0 = E(Y0 |Z = 1) −
E(Y0 |Z = 0). Therefore, a rejection of the testable
implication E(Y0 |Z = 1) − E(Y0 |Z = 0) = 0 in the data would
3 Vander

Weele (2012) and others point out that the presence of a stratumspecific indirect effect cannot be learnt from c1 , which also includes the direct
effect. Our assumptions below allow decomposing c1 into δ1c (z) and θ1c (z).
4 Implicit in our discussion is the “stable unit treatment valuation assumption”
(SUTVA), see Rubin (1977), ruling out that the potential outcomes of one individual depend on the treatment or mediator state of any other individual.

point to a violation of our identifying assumptions. Furthermore, Assumption 1 allows identifying the average treatment
effect in the total population:
1 = E [Y1 | Z = 1] − E [Y1 | Z = 0] .
Moreover, Assumptions 1 and 2 yield the strata proportions,
which we denote by pτ = Pr(τ ), as functions of the conditional
mediator probabilities given the treatment, which we denote by
pd|z = Pr(D = d|Z = z) for d, z in {1,0}:
pa = p1|0 , pc = p1|1 − p1|0 , pn = p0|1 .
Finally, under Assumptions 1–3, the differences in average
baseline outcomes across always or never takers and compliers
are identified by:
E [Y0 (0, 0) |a ] − E [Y0 (0, 0) |c ]
pa + pc
=
[E(Y0 |Z = 0, D = 1) − E(Y0 |Z = 1, D = 1) ] ,
pc
E [Y0 (0, 0) |n ] − E [Y0 (0, 0) |c ]

=
[E(Y0 |Z = 1, D = 0) − E(Y0 |Z = 0, D = 0) ] ,
pc
see equations (A5) and (A16) in the online appendix. However,
to identify direct and indirect effects for any of these groups, we
need to impose some further assumptions.
In contrast to the previous literature which mainly relied on
sequential conditional independence or (in considerably fewer
cases) on instruments, we subsequently base identification on
common trend assumptions, as they are also used for the evaluation of total treatment effects based on difference-in-differences
(DiD) across treatment groups (for a survey, see Lechner 2011).
In contrast to the standard framework that aims at resolving
treatment endogeneity, we impose common trend assumptions
across strata to tackle endogeneity due to conditioning on the
potential mediator states (through the definition of the strata),
while the treatment is random by Assumption 1. This allows for
differences in the effects of unobserved confounders on specific
potential outcomes across strata, as long as these differences are
time invariant.
Assumption 4. Common trends for compliers and never takers under z = 0 and d = 0
E [Y1 (0, 0)| n] − E [Y0 (0, 0)| n]
= E [Y1 (0, 0)| c] − E [Y0 (0, 0)| c] .
Assumption 4 states that the difference in mean potential outcomes under z = 0 and d = 0 over time is identical for never
takers and compliers or equivalently (by rearranging terms), that
the difference in mean potential outcomes under z = 0 and d =
0 across compliers and never takers is constant over time. Similar to the common trend assumption in the standard DiD framework, Assumption 4 cannot directly be tested but can be scrutinized by placebo tests based on comparing the development
of outcomes across groups with Z = 1, D = 0 (never takers)
and Z = 0, D = 0 (never takers and compliers) in pre-treatment
periods. Under Assumptions 1–4, the average direct effect on
the never takers is identified based on four conditional means,

as outlined in Theorem 1.5 It also follows that our assumptions
allow testing one implication of the instrumental variable exclusion restriction: if Z is a valid instrument for D and the parallel
trend assumption holds, then θ1n must be equal to zero.
Theorem 1. Direct effect on the never takers
Under Assumptions 1–4, the average direct effect on the
never takers is identified by a DiD approach among those with
D = 0:
θ1n = E [Y1 |Z = 1, D = 0] − E [Y0 |Z = 1, D = 0]
− {E [Y1 |Z = 0, D = 0] − E [Y0 |Z = 0, D = 0]} .
Proof. Proofs of Theorem 1–6 are relegated to the online
appendix.
The remaining identification results presented in this section are based on stronger assumptions than those underlying
Theorem 1. This implies that several restrictions cannot be scrutinized by any placebo tests as they are commonly used in the
standard DiD framework. The next assumption imposes common trends in the potential outcomes of the always takers and
compliers under z = 1 and d = 1.
Assumption 5. Common trends for compliers and always takers under z = 0 and d = 0 and homogeneous mean effects of Z
and D jointly across compliers and always takers
E [Y1 (0, 0) |a] − E [Y0 (0, 0) |a]
= E [Y1 (0, 0) |c] − E [Y0 (0, 0) |c] ,
E [Y1 (1, 1) |a] − E [Y1 (0, 0) |a]
= E [Y1 (1, 1) |c] E [Y1 (0, 0) |c]
The first part of Assumption 5 is a common trend assumption on mean potential outcomes under z = 0 and d =
0 similar to Assumption 4, however imposed w.r.t. compliers and always takers (rather than never takers). The
second part requires the joint mean effects of Z and D
to be homogeneous across compliers and always takers.
Assumption 5 is therefore stronger than Assumption 4, which
does not require effect homogeneity across strata. We note
that Assumption 5 implies E[Y1 (1, 1)|a] − E[Y0 (1, 1)|a] =
E[Y1 (1, 1)|c] − E[Y0 (1, 1)|c], namely a common trend in mean
potential outcomes of always takers and compliers under z = 1
and d = 1. The first part of Assumption 5, that is, the common trend restriction under z = 0 and d = 0 for always takers and compliers, might be verified by placebo tests based on
comparing the development of outcomes across groups with
Z = 0, D = 1 (always takers) and Z = 1, D = 1 (always takers
and compliers) in pre-treatment periods. The second part with
the homogeneous effect assumption, on the other hand, is not
testable. Under Assumptions 1, 2, 3, and 5, the direct effect
on the always takers is identified. This yields another testable
of θ1n to
violations of Assumption 4 can be investigated by subtracting
from
the right-hand side of the equation in Theorem 1, where diff is the supposed
difference in the trends of the potential outcomes between never takers and
compliers.

− {E [Y1 |Z = 0, D = 0] − E [Y0 |Z = 0, D = 0]} .
We have demonstrated that direct and indirect effects can be
identified for various subpopulations or principal strata under
random treatment assignment and specific common trend and
effect homogeneity assumptions that differ w.r.t. their strength.
In particular, when several common trend assumptions need to
be combined as it is the case for the compliers, identification
only appears plausible if one can credibly assume homogeneity
in average effects across strata. Whenever the principal strataspecific effects for all three strata (compliers, always takers, and
never takers) are identified, so are the natural direct and indirect
effects in the total population. This follows from an application
of the law of total probability:
θ1 (d) = pc θ1c (d) + pa θ1a + pn θ1n


= p1|1 − p1|0 θ1c (d) + p1|0 θ1a + p0|1 θ1n ,


δ1 (d) = pc δ1c (d) + pa 0 + pn 0 = p1|1 − p1|0 δ1c (d) ,

Note that under Assumption 6, θ1a = 0 such that the expression for θ1 (d) further simplifies.
6 As

for Assumption 5, the common trend restriction in the first part can be verified by placebo tests, while the homogeneous effect restriction is not testable.

During the Vietnam War the majority of American troops
consisted of volunteers, while the rest were selected through a
draft (Gimbel and Booth 1996). Young men at age 18 had to
register at local draft boards for classification. Initially, these
boards determined medical fitness and also decided on the order
in which registrants would be called. In an attempt to make the
draft fair, a draft lottery was conducted in the years 1969–1972
to determine the order of call to military service for men born
between 1944 and 1952. The lottery assigned a draft number to
each birth date for men in certain age cohorts, where low draft
numbers were called first up to a ceiling. In our application,
respondents were exposed to the draft lottery taking place on
July 1, 1970. It determined the order in which men born in 1951
were called to report for induction into the military in 1971. The
ceiling of 125 was first announced in October 1971.
We analyze the impact of being assigned a low random draft
lottery number on political preferences and attitudes, and to
understand through which channels this effect materializes. This
empirical application is motivated by the literature using the
random draft lottery number as an instrument for military service (e.g., Angrist 1990; Angrist, Chen and Frandsen 2010),
while other authors argued that the possibility to receive a draft
exemption induced individuals with a low draft number to enter
college (Card and Lemieux 2001; Deuchert and Huber 2017).
In our application, the indirect effect is the effect which goes
through military service. We subsume all other effects into the
direct effect.7 These various effects are also interesting from a
politico-economic perspective: in the political discussion and
decision-making process it is useful to identify how different
groups of the population are affected.
Previous contributions studied the impact of the draft lottery
on political preferences and attitudes toward the war. Bergan
(2009) showed that a low draft lottery number increased the likelihood of people to favor an immediate withdrawal from Vietnam. Erikson and Stoker (2011) analyzed the lottery’s impact
on young college bound males, who were especially vulnerable
to the new draft policy. They found that the effect of the lottery
number on political preferences and attitudes was strong. Young
males with low draft numbers were more likely to favor the
Democrats and had anti-war and liberal attitudes. The results,
however, also showed that only about one-third of respondents
with low draft numbers actually served in the army.
These results illustrate important issues when analyzing the
effect of such a policy change: As a high proportion of respondents managed to avoid the draft, possibly due to a behavioral
change, the ATE could be driven by different subpopulations,
for example, by those who would only enlist when chosen by
the lottery (compliers), or those who would not enlist whatever
the lottery outcome (never takers). It is therefore important to
7 This

can be for example the impact of induced college education, that may
lead to more political participation (Dee 2004; Milligan, Moretti, and Oreopoulos 2004; Kam and Palmer 2008; Milstein Sondheimer and Green, 2009) and
affect political attitudes by increasing personal income (Morton, Tyran, and
Wengström, 2011; Marshall, 2016), or the effect of leaving the country, even
though this option was not used extensively. For a discussion on the estimated
number of evaders leaving the country, see Baskir and Strauss (1978), Hagan
(2001), or Jones (2005).

these subgroups or strata.
3.1 Data
Our data come from the “Young Men in High School and
Beyond” (YESB) survey (Bachman 1999), a five-wave longitudinal study among a national sample of male students who
were in 10th grade in fall 1966. Information was collected in
1966 (wave 1), spring 1968 (at the end of eleventh grade, wave
2), spring 1969 (wave 3), June–July 1970 (wave 4), and spring
1974 (wave 5). We focus on the consequences of the draft lottery
that took place on July 1, 1970.
The dataset is particularly suited for our research question for
several reasons: (1) it contains a vast set of variables describing political preferences and attitudes before and after the lottery took place. (2) It is one of the very rare publicly available
datasets that provides the exact birth date, which is necessary
to link draft lottery numbers to individuals.8 (3) Attrition is relatively low compared to many other longitudinal surveys—we
observe almost 80% of the initial sample in wave 5. (4) Unlike
many other surveys, the data also include individuals serving in
the military (if they can be located).
We use the subsample of respondents who were born in 1951
and who were not yet enlisted at the time of the data collection
of wave 4 in 1970 (N = 849). We restrict the sample because
the exact day of birth is only provided for respondents who participated in the fourth wave and did not serve in the military at
the time of the interview. We do not use young males who were
born in 1950 and before, because this cohort was exposed to the
1969 lottery and we cannot rule out that some respondents with
low random draft numbers were already enlisted or drafted at
the time of the interview. Since we select the base conditional on
treatment, this could cause a selection bias (Deuchert and Huber
2017). However, selection bias seems unlikely in our subsample: no respondents were called for induction yet (inducement
started in 1971) and the majority of interviews took place before
the lottery so individuals were not aware of their random draft
number.
We measure political preferences with various questions.
Specifically, we present summary statistics on the answers to
the question “How would you describe your political preference?” in Table 1. Further empirical results based on measures
of general government attitudes, Vietnam War attitudes, and
preferences for civil rights interventions are presented in the
online appendix. The descriptive statistics on party preferences
in Table 1 display some interesting patterns: Particularly in
the last wave, the Republicans lost dramatically in electoral
support, which most likely reflects the consequence of the
Watergate scandal, with the Republican incumbent President,
Richard Nixon, at center stage.9 Interestingly, the Democrats
did not benefit from the scandal with higher rates of support.

Notes: The columns report the means as well as the standard deviations (in parentheses).
The measure of party preferences is based on question B32 of the “Young Men in High
School and Beyond” survey by Bachman (1999). The question reads: “How would you
describe your political preference?“ Possible answers are: (1) Strongly Republican, (2)
Mildly Republican, (3) Mildly Democrat, (4) Strongly Democrat, (5) American Independent Party, (6) No preference, independent, (7) Other (please specify), (8) Haven’t thought
about it; don’t know. Category 5 to 8 are omitted.

In the midst of the unfolding of the Watergate scandal Richard
Nixon won his bid for re-election with a large margin against
his Democratic rival, George McGovern. It was only after his
re-election to a second term that President Nixon resigned in
1974 to prevent a likely impeachment.
For all outcomes considered, there are no striking differences
in pre-lottery outcomes between individuals with high and low
draft lottery numbers (see the results of the placebo estimates of
the ATE in Table A1 in the online appendix). The same holds for
differences in pre-lottery background characteristics as IQ and
military classification (see the last column of Table A3 in the
online appendix). This indicates that selection bias is unlikely
an issue in this application.
3.2 Plausibility of the Identifying Assumptions
Our empirical application relies on a set of assumptions that are
fairly standard in the empirical literature: Assumption 1 implies
that there are no confounders jointly affecting the lottery outcome on the one hand and military service and/or the outcome
variables on the other hand. This seems uncontroversial since
the draft number was randomized and, unlike the first lottery
that had taken place in 1969, the randomization was well executed (Fienberg 1971). Assumption 2 rules out the existence of
defiers, which seems plausible in the context of the draft lottery.
It appears difficult to argue why an individual should avoid the
draft when being chosen by the lottery, but voluntarily join the
army when not being chosen. Assumption 3 rules out anticipation effects of the treatment or the mediator w.r.t. the outcome
in the baseline period. Given the fact that the results of the lottery could not have been foreseen and that the large majority of
interviews took place before the lottery, this assumption is also
likely to be satisfied. Assumption 4 imposes common trends for
compliers and never takers when receiving a high lottery number and not joining the army. This is a standard restriction in
the DiD literature, arguing that the mean outcomes of various
groups develop in a comparable way if no one receives any treatment.
Assumptions 1 and 3 are sufficient to estimate average treatment effects. The first column of Table A1 in the online

8

appendix provides placebo estimates using wave 4 as placebo
treatment period. The placebo effects are small and insignificant, demonstrating that the lottery was well executed and there
is no selection bias. Assumptions 1–4 are sufficient to estimate
the direct effect on the never takers. Our placebo estimations
compare the development of outcomes across groups with Z =
1, D = 0 (never takers) and Z = 0, D = 0 in pre-treatment periods, namely waves 3 and 4 (second column of Table A1 in the
online appendix). Again, placebo effects are small and insignificant for all outcomes and therefore support our strategy.10
Our theoretical discussion proposes two different possibilities
to estimate the total effect on compliers. Assumption 5 implies
that the joint average effect of the lottery and military service
was comparable across individuals voluntarily joining the army
(always takers) or being induced to join (compliers). This seems
to be a very strong assumption given the fact that military terms
were different for individuals who voluntarily joined the army
and those who were drafted. We find Assumption 6 more credible (zero direct effect on always takers): always takers were
not forced to change their behavior because they would have
joined the army anyway. The lottery outcome was thus irrelevant for always takers. Under Assumptions 1–4, and 6, we can
estimate the total treatment effect on the compliers. We also conduct placebo estimations of the total treatment effect on compliers (Table A1 in the online appendix) based on waves 3 and
4 that support our strategy. Note that these estimations test for
the validity of Assumptions 1–4, as Assumption 6 cannot be
tested in pre-treatment periods (unless Assumption 3 fails for
the always takers).
Finally, there are two ways of decomposing the direct and
indirect effects: Assumption 7 identifies the indirect effect of
joining the army among compliers when having a low lottery number (z = 1), while Assumption 8 identifies the indirect
effect of joining the army when compliers receive a high lottery
number (z = 0). We find the latter effect rather hypothetical and
of very little practical importance since compliers would never
join the army if not induced to by the lottery. We therefore do
not adopt the identification strategy related to Assumption 8.
In contrast, Assumption 7 imposes a homogenous direct treatment effect for compliers and never takers in a hypothetical
world, in which compliers would not comply with the treatment. We thus assume that compliers would adopt exactly the
same draft avoiding strategy (for example, going to college or
leaving the country) as never takers and assume that this draft
avoiding strategy would have an identical impact on political
preferences.
3.3 Average Treatment Effect
In the following, we estimate the effect of a low draft lottery number on party preferences. In the first step, we use the
experimental estimator, that is, mean differences in outcomes
across treatment states, to evaluate the ATE. Table 2 presents
the results, where the binary treatment is equal to one if the
random draft number was below the ceiling. Individuals with
10 The online appendix also provides a graph displaying the evolution of average

pre-treatment outcomes among compliers and never takers between waves 3 and
4, see Figure A1.

lottery numbers below the cut-off are about 5.6% more likely
to report to mildly or strongly favor Republicans. These are,
however, likely to be swing voters, since we find no effect on
strong preferences for Republicans. Moreover, we do not find
any significant effect on preferences for the Democratic Party.
A low lottery number has also no impact on higher scepticism
towards the government or on policy contents (such as the Vietnam War or the Civil Rights Movement, see Table A2 of the
online appendix).
These results are in contrast to the interpretations of the
results proposed by Bergan (2009) and Erikson and Stoker
(2011). They generally interpret their findings to show a substantial positive effect on preferences for Democrats or liberal policy positions. Erikson and Stoker (2011) found that
young men with low lottery numbers held more anti-war attitudes; voted more often for McGovern (Democrat) relative to
Nixon (Republican); favored Democrats over Republicans in a
rating of attitudes towards Nixon vs. McGovern; and favored
Democrats in partisan activities, in a composite issue attitude
index, and in political ideology showing preferences for liberal relative to conservative positions. Bergan (2009) reported
a significantly positive effect of the lottery on the probability of
favoring an immediate withdrawal from Vietnam.
The differences of our results with respect to the studies by
Bergan (2009) and Erikson and Stoker (2011) may be explained
by the sample selection process. Bergan (2009) focused on
a small sample of university students in 1972 and tested the
impact of having a low lottery number while they were still
in college. Once these students graduated they had no further
possibility to receive a deferment. Erikson and Stoker (2011)
focused on individuals with birth years around 1947 whose high
school curriculum was college preparatory. It is thus very likely
that many individuals in their dataset had entered college shortly
after completing high school in 1965 and graduated in 1969 at
the time of the first draft. They were thus at risk to be drafted for
military without the possibility to receive a further deferment,
as deferments for graduate studies were eliminated already in
1967. In both samples, respondents with low random draft numbers had a high draft risk and lacked the possibility to escape
without leaving the country. In our sample, in contrast, individuals just completed high school and, at the time, could still
receive a college deferment (which continued to be issued until

1971). Therefore, in the sample of Erikson and Stoker individuals were basically forced to be compliers (or forced to leave the
country), while in our sample, individuals could choose to be
a complier—at least to some extent. For this reason, effect heterogeneities across strata may be important. In the following,
we distinguish between different strata and estimate direct and
indirect effects of the draft lottery. Moreover, it has to be mentioned that the political preference measures in Bergan (2009)
and Erikson and Stoker (2011) are not identical to ours. Erikson and Stoker (2011) mostly used composite index measures of
preferences, while we use more direct measures of preferences.
3.4 Strata Proportions and Description
In the first stage, we estimate the impact of a random draft
number below the ceiling (RDN < 126) on veteran status (as
reported in 1971) and describe the different strata w.r.t. their
political preferences and attitudes—measured before the lottery
took place.
Table 3 reports the coefficients of a regression of the mediator (D) on the treatment (Z). We observe that the lottery shifted
the likelihood of military service by more than 20 percentage
points, which corresponds to the share of compliers. This seems
relatively small at first glance but can be explained by the fact
that a high share of our sample already held a college deferment
before the lottery took place. About 5% of the population voluntarily joined the army even though they were not obliged to
(always takers). Note that this does not correspond to the share
of all individuals who voluntarily joined the army for two reasons: First, people who voluntarily enlisted before the lottery
took place are not included in our sample since we cannot match
the random draft number with the birth date. Second, a low draft
number may have induced some men to enlist pre-emptively
(Angrist 1991). Because our mediator of interest is military
service—no matter whether individuals joined voluntarily or
were drafted—these pre-emptive enlistments are considered as
compliers. The vast majority of the population are never takers
(74%) who avoided the draft even with a random draft number
below the ceiling of 125—either because they were ineligible or
because they already had or applied for a deferment.
In order to better understand the characteristics of the relevant
groups in our population, Table A3 of the online appendix displays strata differences in pre-treatment background variables
that are estimated based on equations (A5) and (A16) in the
online appendix. While the groups do not seem to differ in their
knowledge about military life, compliers (C) had significantly
lower academic skills measured in terms of an IQ-test, and were

9

less likely to have college plans than never takers (NT). Consequently, compliers were less likely to hold a student deferment
shortly before or at the draft lottery, and were more likely available for the military than never takers. No statistically significant differences can be observed for always takers (AT). Even
though the groups differ with respect to academic skills and college aspiration, Table A4 in the online appendix shows that the
strata are very similar in terms of pre-treatment political preferences prior to the lottery.

3.5 Decomposition of the Average Treatment Effect
In the following, we decompose the ATEs displayed in Table 2
into strata-specific direct and indirect effects to understand
which channels drive the overall findings. The results are displayed in Table 4. The reported standard errors are obtained
based on 1999 bootstrap replications and take account of clustering on the individual level across time periods.
We use the results of Theorem 1 (Assumptions 1–4) to estimate the direct effects of the lottery on the never takers (first
results column of Table 4). The direct effects on the preferences of never takers to at least mildly favor either the Republican or the Democratic Parties are with 5.5 and 4.9 percentage
points, respectively, both positive and sizable, but only statistically significant for the Republicans. One possible interpretation of the significant direct effect on never takers with respect
to mild preferences for Republicans is that Nixon already abolished the draft when the subjects were interviewed in the posttreatment period (1974, wave 5), so that never takers were finally
safe from being inducted into the military. Hence, never takers were actually successful in avoiding the draft, which might
have encouraged them to favor the government which let them
from the hook. However, these effects were not very strong as no
strong party preference shifts can be observed. We also find no
significant effects on general attitudes toward the government,
or attitudes towards the Vietnam War, or the Civil Rights Movement (see Table A2 in the online appendix). This is suggesting
that the draft itself, draft induced military service, or draft avoiding behaviour had little impact on political preferences. These
results are in line with standard microeconomic theory in which
preferences are fairly stable.11
Columns two to four report the estimated total treatment
effects on the compliers based on Theorem 4 (Assumptions 1–4,
and 6), as well as the direct effects under nontreatment and indirect effects under treatment based on Theorem 5 (Assumptions
1–4, 6, and 7). Note that as a result of our identifying assumptions, the direct effect on the compliers and never takers are
identical. The point estimates on the total effect for compliers
point towards a higher support for Republicans and a lower support for Democrats, where the latter effect seems to be driven by
a larger indirect effect of the lottery. However, neither the total
11 Note that stated party preferences can change as a result of evolving party
positions, while underlying preferences remain stable. Such changes in stated
party preferences are then the result of an updating process based on the information on particular party positions and not a sign of endogenous preferences.
This corresponds to the standard microeconomic approach to analyzing human
decision-making.

effects nor the decomposed indirect effects reach conventional
levels of statistical significance.
We also compare our results with the two stage least squares
estimate for the LATE (using analytical standard errors). In the
context of the Vietnam draft lottery, the LATE attempts to measure the complier effect of joining the army (e.g., Angrist 1990;
Angrist, Chen, and Frandsen 2010), which corresponds to the
indirect effect among compliers, as the first stage among compliers is one per definition of compliance. The LATE suggests a
significant 27 percentage points increase in (at least) mild support for Republicans, while the estimate of the indirect effect is
ten times lower and not significant at any conventional level of
statistical significance. As shown in the last column of Table 4,
the difference between the LATE and indirect effect estimates is
significant at the 10% level. The results are therefore not robust
across our method based on common trend and homogeneity
assumptions and the instrumental variable approach used elsewhere in the literature.

we estimate the direct and indirect effects of the draft lottery
within subgroups. We find a significant direct effect on never
takers and compliers, which increased the probability by about
5.5 percentage points to at least mildly favor the Republicans.
Indirect effects are insignificant and much smaller than the two
stage least-squares estimates of the LATE which uses the lottery
as an instrument for military service. As only mild party preferences (and no other measures of political attitudes) are affected,
we propose an interpretation in which swing voters adjust their
reported party preferences, presumably by updating their beliefs
about party platforms. Our findings seem to be in line with basic
microconomic assumptions of stable preferences.

4. CONCLUSION
We propose a difference-in-differences approach to disentangle the total effect of a randomly assigned treatment
within subpopulations (or strata) into a direct effect and an
indirect effect operating through a binary intermediate variable
(or mediator). The strata are defined upon how the mediator
reacts to the treatment. We show under which assumptions the
direct effects on the always and never takers (whose mediator
is not affected by the treatment) as well as the direct and
indirect effects on the compliers (whose mediator reacts to the
treatment) are identified.
We apply our method to investigate the effects of the Vietnam
draft lottery in the U.S. on political preferences and attitudes
toward the government or the Vietnam War. Our mediator of
interest is military service during the Vietnam War. A subgroup
of individuals (the compliers) was induced by the lottery to serve
in the military, while others avoided the draft (the never takers)
or would have served in any case (the always takers). In a first
step, we estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) in the total
population and find a 5.6 percentage points higher probability of
at least mildly favoring the Republican Party. In a second step,
