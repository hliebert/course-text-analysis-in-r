Low birth weight (LBW) infants have lower infant mortality in groups in which LBW is most frequent. For example,
in 1991, US infants born to smokers had higher risks of both LBW and infant mortality than infants born to nonsmokers. However, among LBW infants, infant mortality was lower for infants born to smokers (relative rate ¼ 0.79).
There are competing theories regarding this so-called ‘‘paradox.’’ One is that maternal smoking is beneﬁcial for
LBW infants. The authors use causal diagrams to show that, even in the absence of any beneﬁcial effect of smoking,
an inverse association due to stratiﬁcation on birth weight can be found. This variable is affected by the exposure of
interest and shares common causes with the outcome. That is, LBW infants born to smokers may have a lower risk
of mortality than other LBW infants whose LBW is due to causes associated with high mortality (e.g., birth defects).
Under realistic causal diagrams, adjustment for birth weight is unwarranted when the analytical goal is to estimate
overall effects of prenatal variables on infant mortality. Even for estimating direct effects of prenatal variables,
adjustment for birth weight may be invalid when there is an unmeasured common cause of LBW and mortality.
An appropriate justiﬁcation for conditioning on birth weight requires specifying 1) the causal question motivating this
analytical approach and 2) the assumptions regarding the proposed underlying biologic mechanisms.

weight (LBW) infants in groups with a high prevalence of
LBW have a lower mortality rate than LBW infants in
groups with a low prevalence of LBW, whereas the opposite
is true for normal-weight infants. This phenomenon is
known as the ‘‘birth weight paradox,’’ and it has been a
source of controversy for decades (1). For example, when
studies compared mortality rates between LBW infants born
to smokers and nonsmokers, infants of smokers had lower
mortality rates (2). Although it is widely accepted that infants born to mothers who smoke have lower birth weights
and are at higher risk of neonatal mortality (2), it has been
suggested that the effect of maternal smoking is modified
by birth weight in such a way that smoking is beneficial
for LBW babies (6).

Birth weight is a strong predictor of neonatal and infant
mortality (1). Probably for that reason, and because birthweight data are readily available, investigators have frequently stratified on birth weight when evaluating the effect
of other risk factors (e.g., maternal smoking (2), multiple
pregnancies (3), placenta previa (4), Black race (5)) on infant mortality. This stratification often produces a crossover
of the birth-weight-specific mortality curves: Low birth

Birth Weight (g)
FIGURE 1. Distribution of birth weights among infants born to smokers and nonsmokers, United States, 1991 (national linked birth/infant-death
data, National Center for Health Statistics). The line at 2,500 g indicates the cutoff point used to deﬁne low birth weight.

In this paper, we use national US data to illustrate the
birth weight ‘‘paradox.’’ We then apply causal diagrams to
propose a mechanism, other than effect modification of the
effect of smoking by LBW, that may explain the ‘‘paradox’’
for any exposure. We conclude that the apparently paradoxical crossing of curves could be simply the result of selection bias due to stratification on a common effect (7–10).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

We identified all infants born alive (n ¼ 4,115,494) in the
United States in 1991 through the national linked birth/infantdeath data sets assembled by the National Center for Health
Statistics (11). These data contain information on dates and
causes of death, birth weight, maternal smoking, and other
medical and sociodemographic characteristics systematically recorded on US birth certificates. The infant mortality
rate was defined as number of deaths within the first year of
life per 100,000 livebirths. LBW was defined as birth weight
below 2,500 g. We excluded from the analyses infants with
missing information on birth weight or maternal smoking;
California was excluded because of lack of smoking data.
The final study population included 3,001,621 livebirths.
We calculated overall and birth-weight-specific (within
250-g categories) infant mortality rates and compared them
between infants exposed to smoking during pregnancy and
infants nonexposed to smoking during pregnancy. We used
logistic regression to estimate infant mortality rate ratios
and 95 percent confidence intervals and to control for potential confounders (maternal age, gravidity, education, marital
status, race/ethnicity, and prenatal care). Since adjustment
for these potential confounders had virtually no effect, we
present only the unadjusted rate ratios below. The complex
role of gestational age in perinatal research is beyond the
scope of this paper (12, 13). Additionally, we will not dis-

cuss the potential implications of restricting the analysis to
infants born alive (14) or of dichotomizing birth weight (1).
RESULTS
The ‘‘paradox’’

As figure 1 shows, infants born to women who smoked had
a lower average birth weight (mean ¼ 3,145 g; prevalence of
LBW ¼ 11.4 percent) than infants born to nonsmokers
(mean ¼ 3,370 g; prevalence of LBW ¼ 6.4 percent). The
infant mortality rate was 1,235 per 100,000 livebirths for infants born to smokers and 805 per 100,000 livebirths for
infants born to nonsmokers. Compared with nonsmokers,
the infant mortality rate ratio for smokers was 1.55 (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 1.50, 1.59). This rate ratio
changed to 1.09 (95 percent CI: 1.05, 1.12) upon adjustment
for birth weight.
Infant mortality increased as birth weight decreased
among infants born to both smokers and nonsmokers
(figure 2). However, the birth-weight-specific mortality rate
curve of infants born to smokers crossed over that of infants
born to nonsmokers around the interval of 2,000–2,250 g.
For babies weighing less than 2,000 g at birth, mortality was
higher among infants born to nonsmokers. The infant mortality rate ratio for exposed infants versus nonexposed infants was 0.79 (95 percent CI: 0.76, 0.82) among LBW
infants and 1.80 (95 percent CI: 1.72, 1.88) among infants
with higher birth weights.

those networks (15, 16), as figure 3 shows. The diagrams
link variables (nodes) by arrows (directed edges) that represent direct causal effects (protective or causative) of one
variable on another. DAGs are acyclic because the arrows
never point from a given variable to any other variable in its
past (i.e., causes precede their effects); thus, one can never
start from one variable and, following the direction of the
arrows, end up at the same variable. The absence of an arrow
between two variables indicates that the investigator believes there is no direct effect (i.e., a causal effect not mediated through other variables in the DAG) of one variable
on the other (15, 17). In this article, we build upon previous
publications in which investigators used DAGs to show how
standard adjustment (stratification or regression) for variables affected by exposure may create bias by introducing
a spurious (noncausal) association between the exposure
and the outcome (9, 10, 14).
Figure 3.1 depicts the simplest scenario, in which smoking affects mortality solely through a reduction of birth
weight. Under this scenario, the crude mortality rate ratio
for smoking would be greater than 1, whereas the adjusted
rate ratio and, equivalently, the stratum-specific rate ratios
should be 1. Therefore, the proposed DAG in figure 3.1 is
not consistent with our findings. Note that there might be
common causes of smoking and infant mortality (e.g., socioeconomic factors) that would induce confounding. For simplicity, we assume that our analyses are conducted within
levels of those common causes (i.e., there is complete control for confounding) and thus omit them from the graphs.
Alternatively, smoking might affect mortality solely through
pathways not mediated by birth weight (figure 3.2). In this
Am J Epidemiol 2006;164:1115–1120

case, the crude and adjusted rate ratios would be the same.
Again, this is not consistent with our findings.
Figure 3.3 combines the previous two diagrams: The effect of smoking is only partly mediated by birth weight. In
this case, the adjusted rate ratio would generally differ from
the crude rate ratio and from 1 due to the direct (i.e., not
mediated by birth weight) effect of smoking on mortality,
which is consistent with our findings. Actually, figure 3.3
would be consistent with any finding, because figure 3.3 is
a complete DAG; that is, it does not impose any restrictions
on the values of the stratum-specific rate ratios. As a consequence, figure 3.3 is the simplest graphical representation
of the theory that there is a qualitative modification of the
smoking effect by birth weight. However, most experts
would agree that figure 3.3 is an overly simplistic representation of nature. In a more realistic yet still naı̈ve causal
diagram (figure 3.4), there would be common causes of
LBW and mortality (e.g., birth defects, malnutrition). The
presence of these risk factors (U), usually unmeasured by
the investigator, would generally induce a spurious association between smoking and mortality when the analysis was
stratified on birth weight (10, 14, 18). This (selection) bias
may explain the ‘‘paradox.’’
We now provide a heuristic explanation of why this type
of selection bias arises. To do so, we will use the simplified
diagram shown in figure 3.5. This new diagram uses birth
defects as the unmeasured variable (U) and includes only the
three arrows that are necessary for the bias to occur: an arrow from smoking (the exposure) to birth weight (the variable that the analysis is being stratified on), an arrow from
birth defects to birth weight, and an arrow from birth defects

the data. However, the rationale of the last paragraph still
applies if such an arrow is added. Insofar as there are risk
factors for LBW other than smoking that might themselves
be associated with a higher mortality, the stratified infant
mortality rate ratios for smoking would differ from the crude
rate ratio and could be smaller than 1 even if there were no
beneficial effect of smoking on mortality for LBW infants.
In summary, there will be selection bias when stratifying
on a variable that is 1) affected by exposure and 2) shares
common causes with the outcome. Such a variable does not
need to be on a causal pathway between the exposure and the
outcome (i.e., it does not need to be an intermediate variable) (10, 14, 18).
We can now consider more complicated causal structures
in which the risk factor also has a direct effect on mortality
(e.g., figure 3.6). In this case, the rate ratio adjusted for birth
weight would be a combination of 1) the true direct effect of
smoking on mortality and 2) the bias resulting from the
presence of common causes of LBW and mortality.
Figure 3.7 is an elaboration of figure 3.6 and represents
the hypothesis that there are different ways of achieving
LBW, so that only the type of LBW caused by certain factors (e.g., birth defects), and not others (e.g., smoking, Black
race), increases mortality (1, 2, 19). This causal diagram is
also consistent with our results and could represent, for
example, how Black LBW infants have better survival than
White infants at the same weight. That is, Whites might be
born LBW less often than Blacks but, when they are, the
etiologies of their LBW (e.g., birth defects) might be associated with a higher mortality (20).

to mortality (the outcome). For now, let us suppose that
maternal smoking and birth defects are the only two independent causes of LBW. In this extreme scenario, all of the
LBW infants would have either been exposed to tobacco or
had a birth defect (or both). Thus, all LBW infants not exposed to tobacco would necessarily have birth defects, which
are associated with a higher mortality than smoking. In other
words, there would be an inverse association between maternal smoking and infant mortality among LBW infants.
This would be so even if, as in figure 3.5, maternal smoking
had no causal effect on mortality.
Figure 3.5 does not include a direct arrow from smoking
to mortality and is therefore inconsistent with the unconditional association between smoking and mortality found in

The ‘‘paradox’’ is not limited to smoking and infant mortality. When studying the association between any prenatal
variable (e.g., sex, altitude, race, multiple pregnancy, placenta previa) and any postnatal outcome (e.g., neonatal mortality, cerebral palsy), adjustment for any variable (e.g., birth
weight, gestational age) affected by the exposure of interest
can introduce bias if the causal relation between these variables resembles that represented in figure 3.5. For example,
in words of MacMahon et al., ‘‘at any given weight the
infant [females] in the series with lower mean weight will
have, relative to males, a smaller proportion of members
whose weight is reduced by those factors that are associated with increased mortality, and the group will consistently have a more favorable mortality rate’’ (19, p. 259).
Likewise, consider the association between altitude and
birth weight. Infants born at high altitudes have lower
birth weights than but similar mortality rates as (i.e., rate
ratio ¼ 1) infants born at lower altitudes in comparable
populations (1). However, a rate ratio stratified on birth
weight, unlike the crude rate ratio, might indicate a spurious
protective effect of altitude on infant mortality for LBW
infants. For example, in Denver, Colorado, LBW babies
are born LBW because of either the altitude or other factors.
However, in Los Angeles, California, all LBW babies are
born LBW only because of factors other than the altitude.
Since the LBW caused by altitude does not seem to increase
mortality, a proportion of LBW babies in Denver will not

Smoking

The Birth Weight ‘‘Paradox’’

DISCUSSION

Like previous studies, our study showed that LBW infants
born to mothers who smoke have lower infant mortality than
LBW infants born to nonsmokers. We used causal diagrams
to illustrate how, under biologically plausible causal networks, an inverse association between smoking and infant
mortality can be found among LBW infants even in the
absence of any beneficial effect of smoking. More generally,
stratification by birth weight can induce a spurious association between prenatal exposures and postnatal outcomes.
Because adjustment for birth weight may largely explain
the birth weight ‘‘paradox’’ in the presence of certain causal
structures, the first thing to clarify is why one would want
to adjust for birth weight (21). When the goal is to estimate
the overall effect of prenatal exposures on infant mortality,
adjustment for factors that might be on a causal pathway
between the exposure and the outcome is unwarranted.
Moreover, because prenatal exposures precede birth weight,
birth weight is not generally a confounder and adjustment
for birth weight is not necessary to reduce confounding bias
(14). Therefore, in assessing the overall effect of maternal
smoking on infant mortality, adjustment for birth weight is
generally inappropriate.
However, when the goal is to estimate the direct causal
effect of prenatal exposures on infant mortality (i.e., not
mediated by their effects on birth weight), adjustment for
birth weight may be justified. Although the causal question
is hardly ever stated, we could assume that the authors of
some previous articles on the birth weight ‘‘paradox’’ were
attempting to evaluate the direct effects (not mediated
through birth weight) of prenatal factors (e.g., maternal
smoking) on mortality. Even if the overall effect might seem
of greater interest from a clinical and public health standAm J Epidemiol 2006;164:1115–1120

point, identifying the causal pathways (i.e., the role of
LBW) may contribute to our understanding of infant mortality and lead to more effective interventions. Unfortunately, standard estimates of direct effects adjusted for
birth weight will be biased in the presence of unmeasured
common causes of LBW and mortality, such as those shown
in figures 3.4–3.7 (7, 9). These common causes must be
strongly associated with both birth weight and mortality to
produce a substantial bias (17).
In other words, estimating the direct effect of prenatal
exposures by adjusting for birth weight implies that the
investigators believe that figures 3.1–3.3 are representing
the true state of nature. Otherwise, to avoid the bias introduced by stratification, one could measure and adjust for the
common causes of LBW and mortality, in addition to birth
weight (9). If the common causes are affected by the exposure, methods other than stratification (e.g., G-estimation or
inverse probability weighting) are needed (8, 22, 23). However, these common causes are often unknown or unmeasured, and thus this strategy may be unfeasible.
Some authors have solved the paradox of intersecting
mortality curves by using population-specific standards for
LBW (5) or formulating perinatal risk based on a fetuses-atrisk approach (12). Resolving the paradox by aligning the
curves does not necessarily clarify why the curves crossed
in the first place and might not result in an estimate of the
direct effect, assuming that that was the reason for conditioning on birth weight. However, understanding the origins
of the paradox might help us understand the causes and
effects of LBW (24). For example, exploring the paradox
led Wilcox and Russell (5) to the conclusion that moderate reductions of birth weight do not necessarily increase
mortality, and that birth weight and mortality might be associated because some factor(s) affects them both. This
conclusion, which explains the crossing of the curves, can
be represented with DAGs like the one shown in figure 3.5.
One general limitation of standard causal DAGs is that
they do not encode the magnitude or direction of the effects.
Therefore, the DAGs we propose as more plausible given
our understanding of nature (e.g., figure 3.4) predict that the
rate ratio within levels of birth weight will differ from the
unconditional rate ratio of mortality for maternal smoking
versus no smoking, but they do not predict by themselves
that the birth-weight-specific mortality rate curves will
cross. This latter result can only be derived by adding quantitative information that is not present in the DAG.
In summary, we propose the use of causal diagrams to
provide a conceptual framework for the discussion and interpretation of the birth weight ‘‘paradox,’’ as well as for the
evaluation of the proposed analytical approaches. We have
used causal diagrams to show that this apparent paradox
can be conceptualized as selection bias due to stratification
on a variable (birth weight) that is affected by the exposure
of interest (smoking) and that shares common causes with
the outcome (infant mortality). For estimation of overall effects of prenatal variables on mortality, adjustment for birth
weight is not only unnecessary but potentially harmful. Even
for estimation of direct effects of prenatal variables, adjustment for birth weight is generally not valid when there
is an unmeasured common cause of LBW and mortality.

have increased mortality, while up to 100 percent of LBW
babies in Los Angeles might have increased mortality. That
would result in higher mortality for LBW babies in Los
Angeles compared with LBW babies in Denver.
In fact, similar ‘‘paradoxes’’ can appear in any research
field when statistical adjustments ignore the causal relations
among variables. For example, consider the association between alcoholism, elevated levels of certain hepatic enzymes,
and mortality. Let’s assume that there are two major causes
of hepatic enzyme elevations, alcoholism and liver cancer.
Among patients with elevated levels of hepatic enzymes,
alcoholics would probably have a better short-term prognosis than nonalcoholics because the etiology of enzyme
elevations among the latter was liver cancer. That is, within
patients with elevated hepatic enzyme levels, alcoholism
would be associated with a better prognosis (i.e., mortality
rate ratio < 1). The stratified analyses that lead to these paradoxical (biased) estimates are not only a methodological
problem but also a clinical one, given the potentially invalid
conclusions and recommendations that might be inferred
from such comparisons—for example, if we were to conclude that high alcohol intake is beneficial for patients with
elevated hepatic enzyme levels or that maternal smoking is
beneficial for LBW babies (6).
