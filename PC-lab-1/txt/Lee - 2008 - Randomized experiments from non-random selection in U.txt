Abstract
This paper establishes the relatively weak conditions under which causal inferences from a regression–discontinuity
(RD) analysis can be as credible as those from a randomized experiment, and hence under which the validity of the RD
design can be tested by examining whether or not there is a discontinuity in any pre-determined (or ‘‘baseline’’) variables at
the RD threshold. Speciﬁcally, consider a standard treatment evaluation problem in which treatment is assigned to an
individual if and only if V4v0 , but where v0 is a known threshold, and V is observable. V can depend on the individual’s
characteristics and choices, but there is also a random chance element: for each individual, there exists a well-deﬁned
probability distribution for V. The density function—allowed to differ arbitrarily across the population—is assumed to be
continuous. It is formally established that treatment status here is as good as randomized in a local neighborhood of
V ¼ v0 . These ideas are illustrated in an analysis of U.S. House elections, where the inherent uncertainty in the ﬁnal vote
count is plausible, which would imply that the party that wins is essentially randomized among elections decided by a
narrow margin. The evidence is consistent with this prediction, which is then used to generate ‘‘near-experimental’’ causal
estimates of the electoral advantage to incumbency.

1. Introduction
There is a recent renewed interest in the identiﬁcation issues involved in (Hahn et al., 2001), the estimation
of (Porter, 2003), and the application of (Angrist and Lavy, 1998; van der Klaauw, 2002) Thistlethwaite and
Campbell’s (1960) regression–discontinuity design (RDD). RDDs involve a dichotomous treatment that is a
deterministic function of an single, observed, continuous covariate (henceforth, ‘‘score’’). Treatment is
assigned to those individuals whose score crosses a known threshold. Hahn et al. (2001) formally establish

minimal continuity assumptions for identifying treatment effects in the RDD: essentially, the average outcome
for individuals marginally below the threshold must represent a valid counterfactual for the treated group just
above the threshold. For the applied researcher, there are two limitations to invoking this assumption: (1) in
many contexts, individuals have some inﬂuence over their score, in which case it is unclear whether or not such
an assumption is plausible, and (2) it is a fundamentally untestable assumption.
This paper describes a very general treatment assignment selection model that (1) allows individuals to
inﬂuence their own score in a very unrestrictive way, and (2) generates strong testable predictions that can be
used to assess the validity of the RDD. In particular, it is shown below that causal inferences from RD designs
can sometimes be as credible as those drawn from a randomized experiment.
Consider the following general mechanism for treatment assignment. Each individual is assigned a score V,
which is inﬂuenced partially by (1) the individual’s attributes and actions, and (2) by random chance. Suppose
that conditional on the individual’s choices and characteristics, the probability density of V is continuous.
Treatment is given to the individual if and only if V is greater than a known threshold v0 . Note that there is
unrestricted heterogeneity in the density function for V across individuals, so that each individual will in
general have a different (and unobserved to the analyst) probability of treatment assignment.
Below it is formally established that this mechanism not only satisﬁes the minimal assumptions for RDDs
outlined in Hahn et al. (2001); it additionally generates variation in treatment status that is as good as
randomized by an experiment—in a neighborhood of V ¼ v0 . Close to this threshold, all variables determined
prior to assignment will be independent of treatment status. Thus—as in a randomized experiment—
differences in post-assignment outcomes will not be confounded by omitted variables, whether observable or
unobservable.
This alternative formulation of a valid RDD and the local independence result are useful for three different
reasons. First, it illustrates that natural randomized experiments can be isolated even when treatment status is
driven by non-random self-selection. For example, the vote share V obtained by a political candidate could be
dependent on her political experience and campaigning effort, so that on average, those who receive the
treatment of winning the election (V 4 12) are systematically more experienced and more ambitious. Even in
this situation, provided that there is a random chance error component to V that has continuous pdf,
treatment status in a neighborhood of V ¼ 12 is statistically randomized.
Second, in any given applied context, it is arguably easy to judge whether or not the key condition
(continuous density of V for each individual) holds. This is because the condition is directly related to
individuals’ incentives and ability to sort around the threshold v0 . As discussed below, if individuals have exact
control over their own value of V, the density for each individual is likely to be discontinuous. When this is the
case, the RDD is likely to yield biased impact estimates.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the local independence result implies a strong empirical test of the
internal validity of the RDD. In a neighborhood of v0 , treated and control groups should possess the same
distribution of baseline characteristics. The applied researcher can therefore verify—as in a randomized
controlled trial—whether or not the randomization ‘‘worked’’, by examining whether there are treatmentcontrol differences in baseline covariates.1 These speciﬁcation tests are not based on additional assumptions;
rather, they are auxiliary predictions—consequences of the assignment mechanism described above. The local
random assignment result also gives a theoretical justiﬁcation for expecting impact estimates to be insensitive
to the inclusion of any combination of baseline covariates in the analysis.2
The result is applied to an analysis of the incumbency advantage in elections to the United States House of
Representatives. It is plausible that the exact vote count in large elections, while inﬂuenced by political actors
in a non-random way, is also partially determined by chance beyond any actor’s control. Even on the day of
an election, there is inherent uncertainty about the precise and ﬁnal vote count. In light of this uncertainty, the
local independence result predicts that the districts where a party’s candidate just barely won an election—and

Such speciﬁcation checks have been used recently, for example, in Lee et al. (2004), Linden (2004), Martorell (2004), Clark (2004),
Matsudaira (2004), DiNardo and Lee (2004).

Hahn et al. (2001) do state that the ‘‘advantage of the method is that it bypasses many of the questions concerning model speciﬁcation:
both the question of which variables to include in the model for outcomes,’’ but provide no justiﬁcation for why the treatment effect
estimates should be insensitive to the inclusion of baseline characteristics.

hence barely became the incumbent—are likely to be comparable in all other ways to districts where the
party’s candidate just barely lost the election. Differences in the electoral success between these two groups in
the next election thus identiﬁes the causal party incumbency advantage.
Results from data on elections to the United States House of Representatives (1946–1998) yields the
following ﬁndings. First, the evidence is consistent with the strong predictions of local random assignment of
incumbency status around the 50% vote share threshold. Among close electoral races, the districts where a
party wins or loses are similar along ex ante, pre-determined characteristics. Second, party incumbency is
found to have a signiﬁcant causal effect on the probability that a political party will retain the district’s seat in
the next Congress; it increases the probability on the order of 0.40 to 0.45.3 The magnitude of the effect on the
vote share is about 0.08. Second, losing an election reduces the probability of a candidate running again for
ofﬁce by about 0.43, consistent with an enormous deterrence effect.
Section 2 provides a brief background on RDDs, reviews the key statistical properties and implications of
truly randomized experiments, and formally establishes how the treatment assignment mechanism described
above can share those properties. Section 3 describes the inference problem, data issues, and the empirical
results of an RDD analysis of the incumbency advantage in the U.S. House. Section 4 concludes.
2. Random assignment from non-random selection
In a RDD the researcher knows that treatment is given to individuals if and only if an observed covariate V
crosses a known threshold v0 .4 In Thistlethwaite and Campbell’s (1960) original application of the RDD, an
award was given to students who obtained a minimum score on a scholarship examination. OLS was used to
estimate differences in future academic outcomes between the students who scored just above and below the
passing threshold. This discontinuity gap was attributed to the effect of the test-based award.
Hahn et al. (2001) was the ﬁrst to link the RDD to the treatment effects literature, and to formally explore
the sources of identiﬁcation that underlie the research design. There, it is established that the mere treatment
assignment rule itself is insufﬁcient to identify any average treatment effect. Identiﬁcation relies on the
assumption that
E½Y 0 jV ¼ v and

E½Y 1 jV ¼ v are continuous in v at v0 ,

(1)

where Y 1 and Y 0 denote the potential outcomes under the treatment and control states, and V is the score that
determines treatment.5 This makes clear that the credibility of RDD impact estimates depends on whether or
not the mean outcome for individuals marginally below the threshold identiﬁes the true counterfactual for
those marginally above the threshold v0 .
For empirical researchers, however, there are two practical limitations to the assumption in (1). First, in
many real-world contexts, it is difﬁcult to determine whether the assumption is plausible. This is because (1) is
not a description of a treatment-assigning process; instead, it is a statement of what must be mathematically
true if the RD gap indeed identiﬁes a causal parameter. For example, in Thistlethwaite and Campbell’s (1960)
example, if the RD gap represents a causal effect, then the outcomes for students who barely fail must
represent what would have happened to the marginal winners had they not received the scholarship. But at
ﬁrst glance, there appears to be nothing about this context would lead us to believe—or disbelieve—that (1)
actually holds. Second—perhaps more importantly—assumption (1) is fundamentally untestable; there is no
way for a researcher to empirically assess its plausibility.
The discussion below attempts to address these two limitations. It is shown that a somewhat unrestrictive
treatment-assignment mechanism not only satisﬁes 1, but the variation in the treatment—in a neighborhood of
v0 —shares the same statistical properties as a classical randomized experiment. As discussed in Section 2.4, the
key condition for this result is intuitive and its plausibility is arguably easier to assess than (1) in an applied
setting. The plausibility of the key condition is directly linked to how much control individuals have over the
3
As discussed below, the causal effect for the individual that I consider is the effect on the probability of both becoming a candidate and
winning the subsequent election. Below I discuss the inherent difﬁculty in isolating the causal effect conditional on running for re-election.

More generally, there are two types of designs: the so-called ‘‘sharp’’ and ‘‘fuzzy’’ designs, as described in Hahn et al. (2001). This paper
focuses on the sharp RD.

determination of the score V. Indeed, it becomes clear how economic behavior can sometimes invalidate RDD
inferences. Furthermore, as shown in Section 2.2 the ‘‘local randomization’’ result implies that these key
conditions generate strong testable restrictions that are analogous to those implied by a true randomized
experiment.
2.1. Review of classical randomized experiments
In order to introduce notation and provide a simple basis for comparison, this section formally reviews the
statistical properties and implications of classical randomized experiments. The next section will describe a
general non-experimental (and non-randomized) treatment assignment mechanism that nevertheless shares
these properties and implications—among individuals with realized scores close to the RD threshold.
Consider the following stochastic mechanism: (1) randomly draw an individual from a population of
individuals, (2) assign treatment to the individual with constant probability p0 , and (3) measure all variables,
including the outcome of interest. Formally, let ðY ; X ; DÞ be observable random variables generated by this
process, where Y is the outcome variable of interest, X is any ‘‘pre-determined’’ variable (one whose value has
already been determined prior to treatment assignment), and D an indicator variable for treatment status.
Adopting the potential outcomes framework, we imagine that the assignment mechanism above actually
generates ðY 1 ; Y 0 ; X ; DÞ where Y 1 and Y 0 are the outcomes that will occur if the individual receives or is
denied treatment, respectively. For any one individual, we cannot observe Y 1 and Y 0 simultaneously. Instead,
we observe Y ¼ DY 1 þ ð1  DÞY 0 .
To emphasize the distinction between the random process that draws an individual from the population and
that which assigns treatment—and to help describe the results in a later section—it is helpful to provide an
equivalent description of the data generating process.
Condition 1a. Let ðW ; DÞ be a pair of random variables (with W unobservable), and let Y 1  y1 ðW Þ,
Y 0  y0 ðW Þ, X  xðW Þ, where y1 ðÞ, y0 ðÞ, and xðÞ are real-valued functions.6
One can think of W as either the ‘‘type’’ or ‘‘identity’’ of the randomly drawn individual. There is no loss of
generality in assuming that it is a one-dimensional random variable. Statements of all propositions in this
section, as well as their proofs, can be developed within a measure-theoretic framework.7 By deﬁnition, D is
not an argument of either y1 or y0 , and since X has already been determined prior to treatment assignment, D
is also not an argument of the function x.
Under random assignment, every individual has the same probability of receiving the treatment, so that we
have:
Condition 2a. Pr½D ¼ 1jW ¼ w ¼ p0 for all w in the support of W.
As a result, we obtain three well-known and useful implications of a randomized experiment, summarized as
follows:
Proposition 1. If Conditions 1a and 2a hold, then:
(a)

Pr½W pwjD ¼ 1 ¼ Pr½W pwjD ¼ 0 ¼ Pr½W pw;

(b)

E½Y jD ¼ 1  E½Y jD ¼ 0 ¼ E½Y 1  Y 0  ¼ ATE.

(c)

Pr½X px0 jD ¼ 1 ¼ Pr½X px0 jD ¼ 0;

8w in the support of W .

8x0 .

It is easy to see that (a) simply follows from Condition 1a and Bayes’ rule. Since the distribution of W is
identical irrespective of treatment status and Y 1 ; Y 0 , and X are functions of W, (b) and (c) naturally follow.

679

(b) is simply a formal statement of the known fact that in a classical randomized experiment, the difference
in the conditional means of Y will identify the average treatment effect (ATE). (c) is a formal statement of
another important consequence of random assignment. It states that any variable that is determined prior to
the random assignment will have the same distribution in either the treatment or control state. This formalizes
why analysts expect predetermined (or ‘‘baseline’’) characteristics to be similar in the treatment and control
groups (apart from sampling variability).
Indeed, in practice, analyses of randomized experiments typically begin with an assessment of the comparability
of treated and control groups in the baseline characteristics X. Thus, Condition 2a generates many testable
restrictions, and applied researchers ﬁnd those tests useful for empirically assessing the validity of the assumption.
2.2. Random assignment from a RDD
In most applied contexts, researchers know that assignment to treatment is not randomized as in an
experiment. Instead, they believe in non-random self-selection into treatment status. It is shown here that even
when this is the case, the RDD can nevertheless sometimes identify impact estimates that share the same
validity as those available from a randomized experiment.
Consider the following data generating process: (1) randomly draw an individual from a population of
individuals, after they have made their optimizing decisions, (2) assign a score V, drawn from a non-degenerate,
sufﬁciently ‘‘smooth’’ individual-speciﬁc probability distribution, (3) assign treatment status based on the rule
D ¼ 1½V X0 where 1½ is an indicator function, and (4) measure all variables, including the outcome of interest.
More formally, we have:
Condition 1b. Let ðW ; V Þ be a pair of random variables (with W unobservable, V observable), and let
Y 1  y1 ðW Þ, Y 0  y0 ðW Þ, X  xðW Þ, where y1 ðÞ, y0 ðÞ, and xðÞ are real-valued functions. Also, let
D ¼ 1½V X0. Let GðÞ be the marginal cdf of W.
Condition 2b. F ðvjwÞ, the cdf of V conditional on W, is such that 0oF ð0jwÞo1, and is continuously
differentiable in v at v ¼ 0, for each w in the support of W. Let f ðÞ and f ðjÞ be the marginal density of V and
the density of V conditional on W, respectively, with f ð0Þ40.
Note that by allowing the distribution of V conditional on W to depend on w in a very general way, individuals
can take action to inﬂuence their probability of treatment. But V has some random chance element to it, so that
each individual’s probability of receiving treatment is somewhere between 0 and 1. In addition, Condition 2b implies
that for each individual, the probability of obtaining a V just below and just above 0 are the same. Note that
Condition 2b still allows arbitrary correlation—in the overall population—between V and any one of Y 1 , Y 0 , or X.
The main result is a proposition analogous to Proposition 1.
Proposition 2. If Conditions 1b and 2b hold, then:
(a)
(b)

Pr½W pwjV ¼ v is continuous in v at v ¼ 0;

(a), (b), and (c) are analogous to (a), (b), and (c) in Proposition 1. (a) states that the probability distribution
of the identity or ‘‘type’’ of individuals is the same just above and below v ¼ 0.8 (b) states that the
8

The easiest way to see this is to let W be a continuous random variable, and let gðjÞ and gðÞ denote the density of W conditional on V,
and the marginal density of W, respectively. Then, we have by Bayes’ Rule gðwjvÞ ¼ f ðvjwÞgðwÞ=f ðvÞ, which by Condition 2b is continuous

discontinuity in the conditional expectation function identiﬁes an average treatment effect.9 (c), which follows
from (b), states that all pre-determined characteristics should have the same distribution just below and above
the threshold. (c) implies that empirical researchers can empirically assess the validity of their RDD, by
examining whether or not, for example, the mean of any pre-determined X conditional on V changes
discontinuously around 0. If it does, either Condition 1b or 2b must not hold.
It is important to note that ATE  is a particular kind of average treatment effect. It is clearly not the
ATE for the entire population. Instead, (b) states that it can be interpreted as a weighted ATE: those
individuals who are more likely to obtain a draw of V near 0 receive more weight than those who are
unlikely to obtain such a draw. Thus, with this treatment-assignment mechanism, it is misleading to state
that the discontinuity gap identiﬁes an average treatment effect ‘‘only for the subpopulation for whom
V ¼ 0’’, which is, after all, a measure zero event. It is more accurate to say that it is a weighted average
treatment effect for the entire population, where the weights are the probability that the individual draws
a V ‘‘near’’ 0.
2.3. Allowing for the impact of V
There are two shortcomings to the treatment-assignment mechanism described by Conditions 1b and 2b.
First, it may be too restrictive for some applied contexts. In particular, it assumes that the random draw of V
does not itself have an impact on the outcome—except through its impact on treatment status. That is, while V
is allowed to be correlated with Y 1 or Y 0 in the population, V is not permitted to have an independent causal
impact on Y for a given individual. In a non-experimental setting, this may be unjustiﬁable. For example, a
student’s score on a scholarship examination might itself have an impact on later-life outcomes, quite
independently of the receipt of the scholarship.
Second, the counterfactuals Y 1 and Y 0 may not even be well-deﬁned for certain values of V. For example,
suppose a merit-based scholarship is awarded to a student solely on the basis of scoring 70% or higher on a
particular examination. What would it mean to receive a test-based scholarship even while scoring 50 on the
test, or to be denied the scholarship even after scoring a 90? In such cases, Y 1 is simply not deﬁned for those
with V o0, and Y 0 is not deﬁned for those with V i X0. It may nevertheless be of interest to know the direct
impact of winning a test-based scholarship on future academic outcomes.
As another example, suppose we are interested in the causal impact of a Democratic electoral victory in a
U.S. Congressional District race on the probability of future Democratic electoral success. We know that a
Democratic electoral victory is a deterministic function of the vote share. Again, the counterfactual notation is
awkward, since it makes little sense to conceive of the potential outcome of a Democrat who lost the election
with 90% of the vote.
To address the limitations above consider the alternative assumption:
Condition 1c. Let ðW ; V Þ be a pair of random variables (with W unobservable, V observable), and let
Y  yðW ; V Þ, and X  xðW Þ, where for each w, yð; Þ is continuous in the second argument except at V ¼ 0,
where the function is only continuous from the right. Deﬁne the function y ðwÞ ¼ lime!0  yðw; eÞ and
yþ ðwÞ ¼ yðw; 0Þ.
yð; Þ is a response function relating the outcome to a realization of V. For individual w with realization v of
the score V, the outcome would be yðw; vÞ. The function yð; Þ is simply an analogue to the potential outcomes
‘‘function’’ utilized in Conditions 1a and 1b, except that the second argument is a continuous rather than a
discrete variable. For each individual w, there exists an impact of interest, yþ ðwÞ  y ðwÞ, and the RD analysis
identiﬁes an average of these impacts.

in v at v ¼ 0. It follows that 1 gðzjvÞ dz is continuous in v at v ¼ 0. A more general measure-theoretic statement of the proposition that
does not require W to be a continuous random variable, and its

Following the preceding Rfootnote, we have E½Y jV ¼ 0 ¼ 1 y1 ðwÞgðwj0Þ dw ¼ 1 y1 ðwÞðf ð0jwÞ=f ð0ÞÞgðwÞ dw. Similarly, it follows

that limD!0 E½Y jV ¼ D ¼ 1 y0 ðwÞðf ð0jwÞ=f ð0ÞÞgðwÞ dw, by continuity.

This leads to:
Proposition 3. If Conditions 1c and 2b hold, then (a) and (c) of Proposition 2 holds, and

So ATE  is a weighted average of individual-speciﬁc discontinuity gaps yþ ðÞ  y ðÞ where the weights are
the same as in Proposition 2.10

2.4. Self-selection and random chance
The continuity Condition 2b is crucial to the local random assignment results of Propositions 2 and 3. It is
easy to see that if, for a non-trivial fraction of the population, the density of V is discontinuous at the cutoff
point, then (a), (b), and (c) of Propositions 2 and 3 will generally not be true. Condition 2b is also somewhat
intuitive and its plausibility is arguably easier to assess than 1. Indeed, there is a link between Condition 2b
and the ability of agents to manipulate V, particularly around the discontinuity threshold. When agents can
precisely manipulate their own value of V, it is possible that Condition 2b will not hold, and the RDD could
then lead to biased impact estimates.
For example, suppose a non-trivial fraction of students taking the examination knew with certainty, for
each question, whether or not their answer was correct—even while taking the exam. If these students cared
only about winning the scholarship per se, and if spending time taking the exam is costly, they would choose to
answer the minimum number of questions correctly (e.g. 70) to obtain the scholarship. In this scenario, clearly
the density of V would be discontinuous at the cutoff point, and thus the use of the RDD would be
inappropriate.
Alternatively, suppose for each student, there is an element of chance that determines the score. The student
may not know the answers to all potential questions, so that at the outset of the examination, which of
those questions will appear has a random component to it. The student may feel exceptionally sharp
that day or instead may have a bad ‘‘test’’ day, both of which are beyond the control of the student. If this
is a more believable description of the treatment assignment process, then Condition 2b would seem
plausible.
One way to formalize the difference between these two different scenarios is to consider that V is the sum of
two components: V ¼ Z þ e. Z denotes the systematic, or predictable component of V that can depend on the
individuals’ attributes and/or actions (e.g. students’ efforts in studying for the exam), and e is an exogenous,
random chance component (e.g. whether the ‘‘right’’ questions appear on the exam, having a good ‘‘testing’’
day), with a continuous density. In the ﬁrst scenario, there was no stochastic component e, since the student
knew exactly whether each of his answers was correct. In the second scenario, however minimally, the
component e—random chance—does inﬂuence the ﬁnal score V.
In summary, Propositions 2 and 3 show that localized random assignment can occur even in the presence of
endogenous sorting, as long as agents do not have the ability to sort precisely around the threshold. If they
can, the density of V is likely to be discontinuous, especially if there are beneﬁts to receiving the treatment. If
they cannot—perhaps because there is ultimately some unpredictable, and uncontrollable (from the point of
view of the individual) component to V—the continuity of the density may be justiﬁable.

The easiest way to see this is to let W be a continuous random variable
and yð; Þ be continuous
in both of its arguments, except
R1
R1
possibly in its second argument at VR¼ 0. Then, we have E½Y jV ¼ 0 ¼ 1 yðw; 0Þgðwj0Þ dw ¼ 1 yþ ðwÞðf ð0jwÞf ð0ÞÞgðwÞ dw. Similarly, it
1
follows that limD!0 E½Y jV ¼ D ¼ 1 y ðwÞðf ð0jwÞf ð0ÞÞgðwÞ dw, by continuity. A more general statement of the proposition and proof is

2.5. Relation to selection models
The treatment-assignment mechanism described by Conditions 1b (or 1c) and 2b has some generality. The
conditions are implicitly met in typical econometric models for evaluation studies (except for the observability
of V). For example, consider the reduced-form formulation of Heckman’s (1978) dummy endogenous-variable
model:
y1 ¼ x1 a1 þ db þ u1 ,
y2 ¼ x2 a2 þ u2 ,
d¼1
¼0

if y2 X0
if y2 o0,

ð2Þ

where y1 is the outcome of interest, d is the treatment indicator, x1 and x2 are exogenous variables and ðu1 ; u2 Þ
are error terms that are typically assumed to be bivariate normal and jointly independent of x1 and x2 . An
exclusion restriction typically dictates that x2 contains some variables that do not appear in x1 .
Letting V ¼ y2 , and Y 1 ¼ x1 a1 þ b þ u, Y 0 ¼ x1 a1 þ u, and D ¼ d, it is clear that this conventional
selection model satisﬁes Conditions 1b and 2b, except that y2 here is unobservable. In this setting, it is crucial
that the speciﬁcation (e.g. the choice of variables x1 and x2 , the independence assumption, the exclusion
restriction) of the model is correct. Any mis-speciﬁcation (e.g. missing some variables, correlation between the
errors and x1 and x2 , violation of exclusion restriction) will lead to biased estimates of a1 , a2 , and b.
When, on the other hand, the researcher is fortunate enough to directly observe y2 —as in the RDD—none
of the variables in x1 or x2 are needed for the estimation of b. And it is also unnecessary to assume
independence of the errors u1 ; u2 . If x1 and x2 are available to the researcher (and insofar as they are known to
have been determined prior to the assignment of d), they can be used to check the validity of the continuity
Condition 2b, which drives the local random assignment result. Propositions 2 and 3 imply that this can be
done, for example, by examining the difference E½x1 jy2 ¼ 0  limD!0 E½x1 jy2 ¼ D. If the local random
assignment result holds, this difference should be zero. The variables x1 and x2 serve another purpose in this
situation. They can be included in a regression analysis to reduce sampling variability in the impact estimates.
Local independence implies that the inclusion of those covariates will lead to alternative, consistent estimates,
with generally smaller sampling variability. This is analogous to including baseline characteristics in the
analysis of randomized experiments.
It should be noted that this connection between RDD and selection models is not speciﬁc to the well-known
parametric version of Eq. (2). The arguments can easily be extended for a more generalized selection model
that does not assume, for example, the linearity of the indices x1 a1 or x2 a2 , the joint normality of the errors, or
the implied constant treatment effect assumption. Indeed, Condition 1b (or 1c) is perhaps the least restrictive
description possible for a selection model for the treatment evaluation problem.
3. RDD analysis of the incumbency advantage in the U.S. House
This section applies the ideas developed above to the problem of measuring the electoral advantage of
incumbency in the United States House of Representatives. In the discussion that follows, the ‘‘incumbency
advantage’’ is deﬁned as the overall causal impact of being the current incumbent party in a district on the
votes obtained in the district’s election. Therefore, the unit of observation is the Congressional district. The
relation between this deﬁnition and others commonly used in the political science literature is discussed brieﬂy
in Section 3.5 and in more detail in Appendix B.
3.1. The inference problem in measuring the incumbency advantage
One of the most striking facts of congressional politics in the United States is the consistently high rate of
electoral success of incumbents, and the electoral advantage of incumbency is one of the most studied aspects
of research on elections to the U.S. House (Gelman and King, 1990). For the United States House of

Fig. 1. Electoral success of U.S. House incumbents: 1948–1998. Note: Calculated from ICPSR study 7757 (ICPSR, 1995). Details in
Appendix A. Incumbent party is the party that won the election in the preceding election in that congressional district. Due to redistricting on years that end with ‘‘2’’, there are no points on those years. Other series are the fraction of individual candidates in that year,
who win an election in the following period, for both winners and runner-up candidates of that year.

Representatives, in any given election year, the incumbent party in a given congressional district will likely
win. The solid line in Fig. 1 shows that this re-election rate is about 90% and has been fairly stable over the
past 50 years.11 Well known in the political science literature, the electoral success of the incumbent party is
also reﬂected in the two-party vote share, which is about 60–70% during the same period.12
As might be expected, incumbent candidates also enjoy a high electoral success rate. Fig. 1 shows that the
winning candidate has typically had an 80 percent chance of both running for re-election and ultimately winning.
This is slightly lower, because the probability that an incumbent will be a candidate in the next election is about
88%, and the probability of winning, conditional on running for election is about 90%. By contrast, the runnerup candidate typically had a 3% chance of becoming a candidate and winning the next election. The probability
that the runner-up even becomes a candidate in the next election is about 20% during this period.
The overwhelming success of House incumbents draws public attention whenever concerns arise that
Representatives are using the privileges and resources of ofﬁce to gain an ‘‘unfair’’ advantage over potential
challengers. Indeed, the casual observer is tempted to interpret Fig. 1 as evidence that there is an electoral
advantage to incumbency—that winning has a causal inﬂuence on the probability that the candidate will run
for ofﬁce again and eventually win the next election. It is well known, however, that the simple comparison of
incumbent and non-incumbent electoral outcomes does not necessarily represent anything about a true
electoral advantage of being an incumbent.
As is well-articulated in Erikson (1971), the inference problem involves the possibility of a ‘‘reciprocal causal
relationship’’. Some—potentially all—of the difference is due to a simple selection effect: incumbents are, by
deﬁnition, those politicians who were successful in the previous election. If what makes them successful is somewhat
persistent over time, they should be expected to be somewhat more successful when running for re-election.
3.2. Model
The ideal thought experiment for measuring the incumbency advantage would exogenously change the
incumbent party in a district from, for example, Republican to Democrat, while keeping all other factors

constant. The corresponding increase in Democratic electoral success in the next election would represent the
overall electoral beneﬁt due to being the incumbent party in the district.
There is an RDD inherent in the U.S. Congressional electoral system. Whether or not the Democrats are the
incumbent party in a Congressional district is a deterministic function of their vote share in the prior election.
Assuming that there are two parties, consider the following model of Congressional elections:
vi2 ¼ awi1 þ bvi1 þ gd i2 þ ei2 ,


1
d i2 ¼ 1 vi1 X ,
2
f i1 ðvjwÞ Fdensity of vi1 conditional on wi1 Fis continuous in v,
E½ei2 jwi1 ; vi1  ¼ 0,

ð3Þ

where vit is the vote share for the Democratic candidate in Congressional district i in election year t. d i2 is the
indicator variable for whether the Democrats are the incumbent party during the electoral race in year 2. It is a
deterministic function of whether the Democrats won election 1. wi1 is a vector of variables that reﬂect all
characteristics determined or agents’ choices as of election day in year 1.
The ﬁrst line in (3) is a standard regression model describing the causal impacts of wi1 ; vi1 , and d i2 on vi2 . wi1
could represent the partisan make-up of the district, party resources, or the quality of potential nominees. vi1 is
also permitted to impact vi2 . For example, a higher vote share may attract more campaign donors, which in
turn, could boost the vote share in election year 2. The potentially discontinuous jump in how vi1 impacts vi2 is
captured by the coefﬁcient g, and is the parameter of interest—the electoral advantage to incumbency.
The main problem is that elements of wi1 may be unobservable to the researcher, so OLS will suffer from an
omitted variables bias, since wi1 might be correlated with vi1 , and hence with d i2 . That is, the inherent
advantages the Democrats have in a congressional district (e.g. the degree of liberalness of the constituency,
party resources allocated to the district) will naturally be correlated with their electoral success in year 1, and
hence will be correlated with whether they are the incumbent party during the electoral race in year 2. This is
why a simple comparison of electoral success in year 2, between those districts where the Democrats won and
lost in year 1, is likely to be biased.
But
 an1RDD can plausibly
 1be used here.
 Letting
 W ¼ wi1 , V ¼ vi1 , and Y ¼ yðW ; V Þ ¼ aW þ bV þ
1
g  1 V X 2 , we have g ¼ y w; 2  lime!0þ y w; 2  e . Conditions 1c and 2b hold, and so Proposition 3
applies.13 Intuitively, conditional on agents’ actions and characteristics as of election day, if there exists a
random chance element (that has a continuous density) to the ﬁnal vote share vi1 , then whether the Democrats
win in a closely contested election is would determined as if by a ﬂip of a coin. As a consequence, we can
obtain credible estimates of the electoral advantage to incumbency by comparing the average Democratic vote
shares in year 2 between districts in which Democrats narrowly won and narrowly lost elections in year 1.
The crucial assumption here is that—even if agents can inﬂuence the vote—there is nonetheless a non-trivial
random chance component to the ultimate vote share, and that conditional on the agents’ choices and
characteristics, the vote share vi1 has a continuous density. It is plausible that there is at least some random chance
element to the precise vote share. For example, the weather on election day can inﬂuence turnout among voters.
Assuming a continuous density requires that certain kinds of electoral fraud are negligible or non-existent.
For example, suppose a non-trivial fraction of Democrats (but no Republicans) had the ability to (1)
selectively invalidate ballots cast for their opponents and (2) perfectly predict what the true vote share would
be without interfering with the vote counting process. In this scenario, suppose the Democrats followed the
following rule: (a) if the ‘‘true’’ vote count would lead to a Republican win, dispute ballots to raise the
Democratic vote share, but (b) if the ‘‘true’’ vote count leads to a Democratic win, do nothing. It is easy to see
that in repeated elections, this rule would lead to a discontinuous density in vi1 right at the 12 threshold.14
13

With the trivial modiﬁcation that vi2 actually is equal to Y þ ei2 , but ei2 has mean zero conditional on V and W, so that
E½vi2 jvi1  ¼ E½Y jvi1 .
14
Note that other ‘‘rules’’ describing fraudulent behavior would nevertheless lead to a continuous density in vi1 . For example, suppose
all Democrats had the ability to invalidate ballots during the actual vote counting process. Even if this behavior is rampant, if this ability
stops when 90% of the vote is counted, there is still unpredictability in the vote share tally for the remaining 10% of the ballots. It is
plausible that the probability density for the vote share in the remaining votes is continuous.

If this kind of fraudulent behavior is important feature of the data, the RDD will lead to invalid inferences;
but if it is not, then the RDD is an appropriate design. The important point here is that Proposition 3 (c)
implies that the validity of the RDD is empirically testable. That is, if this form of electoral fraud is empirically
important, then all pre-determined (prior to year 1) characteristics (X) should be different between the two
sides of the discontinuity threshold; if it is unimportant, then X should have the same distribution on either
side of the threshold.
3.3. Data issues
Data on U.S. Congressional election returns from 1946 to 1998 are used in the analysis. In order to use all
pairs of consecutive elections for the analysis, the dependent variable vi2 is effectively dated from 1948 to 1998,
and the independent (score) variable vi1 runs from 1946 to 1996. Due to redistricting every 10 years, and since
both lags and leads of the vote share will be used, all cases where the independent variable is from a year
ending in ‘0’ and ‘2’ are excluded. Because of possible dependence over time, standard errors are clustered at
the decade–district level.
In virtually all Congressional elections, the strongest two parties will be the Republicans and the
Democrats, but third parties do obtain some small share of the vote. As a result, the cutoff that determines the
winner will not be exactly 50%. To address this, the main vote share variable is the Democratic vote share
minus the vote share of the strongest opponent, which in most cases is a Republican nominee. The Democrat
wins the election when this variable ‘‘Democratic vote share margin of victory’’ crosses the 0 threshold, and
loses the election otherwise.
Incumbency advantage estimates are reported for the Democratic party only. In a strictly two-party system,
estimates for the Republican party would be an exact mirror image, with numerically identical results, since
Democratic victories and vote shares would have one-to-one correspondences with Republican losses and vote
shares.
The incumbency advantage is analyzed at the level of the party at the district level. That is, the analysis
focuses on the advantage to the party from holding the seat, irrespective of the identity of the nominee for the
party. Estimation of the analogous effect for the individual candidate is complicated by selective ‘‘drop-out’’.
That is, candidates, whether they win or lose an election, are not compelled to run for (re-)election in the
subsequent period. Thus, even a true randomized experiment would be corrupted by this selective attrition.15
Since the goal is to highlight the parallels between RDD and a randomized experiment, to circumvent the
candidate drop-out problem, the estimates are constructed at the district level; when a candidate runs
uncontested, the opposing party is given a vote share of 0.
Four measures of the success of the party in the subsequent election are used: (1) the probability that the
party’s candidate will both become the party’s nominee and win the election, (2) the probability that the
party’s candidate will become the nominee in the election, (3) the party’s vote share (irrespective of who is
the nominee), and (4) the probability that the party wins the seat (irrespective of who is the nominee). The ﬁrst
two outcomes measure the causal impact of a Democratic victory on the political future of the candidate, and
the latter two outcomes measure the causal impact of a Democratic victory on the party’s hold on the district
seat.
Further details on the construction of the data set is provided in Appendix A.
3.4. RDD estimates
Fig. 2a illustrates the RD estimate of the incumbency advantage. It plots the estimated probability of a
Democrat both running in and winning election t þ 1 as a function of the Democratic vote share margin of
victory in election t. The horizontal axis measures the Democratic vote share minus the vote share of the
15

An earlier draft (Lee, 2000) explores what restrictions on strategic interactions between the candidates can be placed to pin down the
incumbency advantage for the candidate for the subpopulation of candidates who would run again whether or not they lose the initial
election. A bounding analysis suggests that most of the incumbency advantage may be due to a ‘‘quality of candidate’’ selection effect,
whereby the effect on drop-out leads to, on average, weaker nominees for the party in the next election.

Democrats’ strongest opponent (virtually always a Republican). Each point is an average of the indicator
variable for running in and winning election t þ 1 for each interval, which is 0.005 wide. To the left of the
dashed vertical line, the Democratic candidate lost election t; to the right, the Democrat won.
As apparent from the ﬁgure, there is a striking discontinuous jump, right at the 0 point. Democrats who
barely win an election are much more likely to run for ofﬁce and succeed in the next election, compared to
Democrats who barely lose. The causal effect is enormous: about 0.45 in probability. Nowhere else is a jump
apparent, as there is a well-behaved, smooth relationship between the two variables, except at the threshold
that determines victory or defeat.
Figs. 3a–5a present analogous pictures for the three other electoral outcomes: whether or not the Democrat
remains the nominee for the party in election t þ 1, the vote share for the Democratic party in the district in
election t þ 1, and whether or not the Democratic party wins the seat in election t þ 1. All ﬁgures exhibit
signiﬁcant jumps at the threshold. They imply that for the individual Democratic candidate, the causal effect
of winning an election on remaining the party’s nominee in the next election is about 0.40 in probability. The
incumbency advantage for the Democratic party appears to be about 7% or 8% of the vote share. In terms of
the probability that the Democratic party wins the seat in the next election, the effect is about 0.35.

In all four ﬁgures, there is a positive relationship between the margin of victory and the electoral outcome.
For example, as in Fig. 4a, the Democratic vote shares in election t and t þ 1 are positively correlated, both on
the left and right side of the ﬁgure. This indicates selection bias; a simple comparison of means of Democratic
winners and losers would yield biased measures of the incumbency advantage. Note also that Figs. 2a, 3a, and
5a exhibit important non-linearities: a linear regression speciﬁcation would hence lead to misleading
inferences.
Table 1 presents evidence consistent with the main implication of Proposition 3: in the limit, there is
randomized variation in treatment status. The third to eighth rows of Table 1 are averages of variables that are
determined before t, and for elections decided by narrower and narrower margins. For example, in the third
row, among the districts where Democrats won in election t, the average vote share for the Democrats in
election t  1 was about 68 percent; about 89 percent of the t  1 elections had been won by Democrats, as the
fourth row shows. The ﬁfth and seventh rows report the average number of terms the Democratic candidate
served, and the average number of elections in which the individual was a nominee for the party, as of election
t. Again, these characteristics are already determined at the time of the election. The sixth and eighth rows
report the number of terms and number of elections for the Democratic candidates’ strongest opponent. These
rows indicate that where Democrats win in election t, the Democrat appears to be a relatively stronger

candidate, and the opposing candidate weaker, compared to districts where the Democrat eventually loses
election t. For each of these rows, the differences become smaller as one examines closer and closer elections—
as (c) of Proposition 3 would predict.
These differences persist when the margin of victory is less than 5% of the vote. This is, however, to be
expected: the sample average in a narrow neighborhood of a margin of victory of 5% is in general a biased
estimate of the true conditional expectation function at the 0 threshold when that function has a non-zero
slope. To address this problem, polynomial approximations are used to generate simple estimates of the
discontinuity gap. In particular, the dependent variable is regressed on a fourth-order polynomial in the
Democratic vote share margin of victory, separately for each side of the threshold. The ﬁnal set of columns
report the parametric estimates of the expectation function on either side of the discontinuity. Several nonparametric and semi-parametric procedures are also available to estimate the conditional expectation function
at 0. For example, Hahn et al. (2001) suggest local linear regression, and Porter (2003) suggests adapting
Robinson’s (1988) estimator to the RDD.
The ﬁnal columns in Table 1 show that when the parametric approximation is used, all remaining
differences between Democratic winners and losers vanish. No differences in the third to eighth rows are

statistically signiﬁcant. These data are consistent with implication (c) of Proposition 3, that all pre-determined
characteristics are balanced in a neighborhood of the discontinuity threshold. Figs. 2b, 3b, 4b, and 5b, also
corroborate this ﬁnding. These lower panels examine variables that have already been determined as of
election t: the average number of terms the candidate has served in Congress, the average number of times he
has been a nominee, as well as electoral outcomes for the party in election t  1. The ﬁgures, which also
suggest that the fourth order polynomial approximations are adequate, show a smooth relation between each
variable and the Democratic vote share margin at t, as implied by (c) of Proposition 3.
The only differences in Table 1 that do not vanish completely as one examines closer and closer elections,
are the variables in the ﬁrst two rows of Table 1. Of course, the Democratic vote share or the probability of a
Democratic victory in election t þ 1 is determined after the election t. Thus the discontinuity gap in the ﬁnal
set of columns represents the RDD estimate of the causal effect of incumbency on those outcomes.
In the analysis of randomized experiments, analysts often include baseline covariates in a regression analysis
to reduce sampling variability in the impact estimates. Because the baseline covariates are independent of
treatment status, impact estimates are expected to be somewhat insensitive to the inclusion of these covariates.
Table 2 shows this to be true for these data: the results are quite robust to various speciﬁcations. Column (1)

reports the estimated incumbency effect when the vote share is regressed on the victory (in election t) indicator,
the quartic in the margin of victory, and their interactions. The estimate should and does exactly match the
differences in the ﬁrst row of the last set of columns in Table 1. Column (2) adds to that regression the
Democratic vote share in t  1 and whether they won in t  1. The coefﬁcient on the Democratic share in t  1
is statistically signiﬁcant. Note that the coefﬁcient on victory in t does not change very much. The coefﬁcient
also does not change when the Democrat and opposition political and electoral experience variables are
included in Columns (3)–(5).
The estimated effect also remains stable when a completely different method of controlling for predetermined characteristics is utilized. In Column (6), the Democratic vote share t þ 1 is regressed on all predetermined characteristics (variables in rows three through eight), and the discontinuity jump is estimated
using the residuals of this initial regression as the outcome variable. The estimated incumbency advantage
remains at about 8% of the vote share. This should be expected if treatment is locally independent of all predetermined characteristics. Since the average of those variables are smooth through the threshold, so should
be a linear function of those variables. This principle is demonstrated in Column (7), where the vote share in
t  1 is subtracted from the vote share in t þ 1 and the discontinuity jump in that difference is examined.
Again, the coefﬁcient remains at about 8%.
Column (8) reports a ﬁnal speciﬁcation check of the RDD and estimation procedure. I attempt to estimate
the ‘‘causal effect’’ of winning in election t on the vote share in t  1. Since we know that the outcome of

Note: Details of data processing in Appendix A. N ¼ 6558 in all regressions. Regressions include a fourth order polynomial in the margin
of victory for the Democrats in election t, with all terms interacted with the Victory, election t dummy variable. Political and electoral
experience is deﬁned in notes to Table 2. Column (6) uses as its dependent variable the residuals from a least squares regression on the
Democrat vote share ðt þ 1Þ on all the covariates. Column (7) uses as its dependent variable the Democrat vote share ðt þ 1Þ minus the
Democrat vote share ðt  1Þ. Column (8) uses as its dependent variable the Democrat vote share ðt  1Þ. Estimated standard errors (in
parentheses) are consistent with state–district–decade clustered sampling.

election t cannot possibly causally effect the electoral vote share in t  1, the estimated impact should be zero.
If it signiﬁcantly departs from zero, this calls into question, some aspect of the identiﬁcation strategy and/or
estimation procedure. The estimated effect is essentially 0, with a fairly small estimated standard error of
0.011. All speciﬁcations in Table 2 were repeated for the indicator variable for a Democrat victory in t þ 1 as
the dependent variable, and the estimated coefﬁcient was stable across speciﬁcations at about 0.38 and it
passed the speciﬁcation check of Column (8) with a coefﬁcient of 0:005 with a standard error of 0.033.
In summary, the econometric model of election returns outlined in the previous section allows for a great
deal of non-random selection. The seemingly mild continuity assumption on the distribution of vi1 results in
the strong prediction of local independence of treatment status (Democratic victory) that itself has an
‘‘inﬁnite’’ number of testable predictions. The distribution of any variable determined prior to assignment
must be virtually identical on either side of the discontinuity threshold. The empirical evidence is consistent
with these predictions, suggesting that even though U.S. House elections are non-random selection
mechanisms—where outcomes are inﬂuenced by political actors—they also contain randomized experiments
that can be exploited by RD analysis.16
3.5. Comparison to existing estimates of the incumbency advantage
It is difﬁcult to make a direct comparison between the above RDD estimates and existing estimates of the
incumbency advantage in the political science literature. This is because the RDD estimates identify a
16

This notion of using ‘‘as good as randomized’’ variation in treatment from close elections has been utilized in Miguel and Zaidi (2003),
Clark (2004), Linden (2004), Lee et al. (2004), DiNardo and Lee (2004).

different, but related concept. The existing literature generally focuses on the concept of an incumbent
legislator advantage, while the RDD approach identiﬁes an overall incumbent party advantage.
Measuring the incumbent legislator advantage answers the following question: From the party’s
perspective, what is the electoral gain to having the incumbent legislator run for re-election, relative
to having a new candidate of the same party run in the same district?17 This incumbency advantage is
the electoral success that an incumbent party enjoys if the incumbent runs for re-election, over and above
the electoral outcome that would have occurred if a new nominee for the party had run in the same
district.18
By contrast, measuring the incumbent party advantage answers the following question: From the party’s
perspective, what is the electoral gain to being the incumbent party in a district, relative to not being the
incumbent party? In other words, while the incumbent party’s vote share typically exceeds 50 percent, some of
the votes would have been gained by the party even if it had not been in control of the seat.
The electoral advantage to being the incumbent party potentially works through a number of different
mechanisms, and includes as a possible mechanism the incumbent legislator advantage. That is, when the
Democratic nominee barely wins an election, it raises the probability that the nominee will run for re-election
as an incumbent legislator. Insofar as there are advantages to being an incumbent legislator as opposed to a
new nominee, this will contribute to the overall incumbent party advantage identiﬁed by the RDD. In
addition, the incumbent party advantage includes the gain that would have occurred even if the victorious
candidate in the ﬁrst election did not run for re-election.
The interested reader is referred to Appendix B, which explains the difference between the RDD estimate of
the incumbency advantage and estimates typically found in the political science literature.
4. Conclusion
In one sense, the RDD is no different from all other research designs: causal inferences are only possible
as a direct result of key statistical assumptions about how treatment is assigned to individuals. The key
assumption examined in this paper is the continuity of the density of V for each individual. What makes the
treatment assignment mechanism described in this paper somewhat distinctive is that what appears to be a
weak continuity assumption directly leads to very restrictive statistical properties for treatment status.
Randomized variation in treatment—independence (local to the threshold)—is perhaps the most restrictive
property possible, with potentially an inﬁnite number of testable restrictions, corresponding to the number of
pre-determined characteristics and the number of available moments for each variable. These testable
restrictions are an advantage when seeking to subject the research design to a battery of over-identifying
tests.19
Although the continuity assumption appears to be a weak restriction—particularly since it is implicitly
made in most selection models in econometrics—there are reasons to believe they might be violated when
agents have direct and exact control over the score V. If there are beneﬁts to receiving the treatment, it is
natural to expect those who gain the most to choose their value of V to be above—and potentially just
marginally above—the relevant threshold. Ruling out this kind of behavior appears to be an important part of
theoretically justifying the application of the RDD in any particular context.
17
The most precise statement of the counterfactual can be found in Gelman and King (1990), who use ‘‘potential outcomes’’ notation, to
deﬁne the ‘‘incumbency advantage’’. They deﬁne the incumbency advantage in a district as the difference between ‘‘the proportion of the
vote received by the incumbent legislator in his or her district...’’ and the ‘‘proportion of the vote received by the incumbent party in that
district, if the incumbent legislator does not run...’’.
18
This notion is also expressed in Alford and Brady (1993), who note that incumbents can incidentally beneﬁt from the party holding the
seat, and that the personal incumbency advantage should be differentiated from the party advantage, and that ‘‘[i]t is this concept of
personal incumbency advantage that most of the incumbency literature, and the related work in the congressional literature, implicitly
turns on.’’ Examples of typical incumbency studies that utilize this concept of incumbency include: Payne (1980), Alford and Hibbing
(1981), Collie (1981), and Garand and Gross (1984). More recently, work by Ansolabehere and Snyder (2001, 2002) and Ansolabehere et
al. (2000) implicitly examine this concept by examining the coefﬁcient on the same incumbency variable deﬁned in Gelman and King
(1990): 1 if a Democrat incumbent seeks re-election, 0 if it is an open seat, and 1 if a Republican seeks re-election.
19
In addition to testing whether baseline characteristics are similar in the marginal treated and control groups, one can examine if there
is a discontinuity in the marginal distribution of V. See McCrary (2004).

Appendix A. Description of data
The data used for this analysis are based on the candidate-level Congressional election returns for the U.S.,
from ICPSR study 7757, ‘‘Candidate and Constituency Statistics of Elections in the United States,
1788–1990’’ (ICPSR, 1995).
The data were initially checked for internal consistencies (e.g. candidates’ vote totals not equalling reported
total vote cast), and corrected using published and ofﬁcial sources (Congressional Quarterly, 1997 and the
United States House of Representatives Ofﬁce of the Clerk’s Web Page). Election returns from 1992–1998
were taken from the United States House of Representatives Ofﬁce of the Clerk’s Web Page, and appended to
these data. Various states (e.g. Arkansas, Louisiana, Florida, and Oklahoma) have laws that do not require
the reporting of candidate vote totals if the candidate ran unopposed. If they are the only candidate in the
district, they were assigned a vote share of 1. Other individual missing vote totals were replaced with valid
totals from published and ofﬁcial sources. Individuals with more than one observation in a district year (e.g.
separate Liberal and Democrat vote totals for the same person in New York and Connecticut) were given the
total of the votes, and were assigned to the party that gave the candidate the most votes. The name of the
candidate was parsed into last name, ﬁrst name, and middle names, and sufﬁxes such as ‘‘Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.’’
Since the exact spelling of the name differs across years, the following algorithm was used to create a unique
identiﬁer for an individual that could match the person over time. Individuals were ﬁrst matched on state, ﬁrst
ﬁve characters of the last name, and ﬁrst initial of the ﬁrst name. The second layer of the matching process
isolates those with a sufﬁx such as Jr. or Sr., and small number of cases were hand-modiﬁed using published
and ofﬁcial sources. This algorithm was checked by drawing a random sample of 100 election-year-candidate
observations from the original sample, tracking down every separate election the individual ran in (using
published and ofﬁcial sources; this expanded the random sample to 517 election-year-candidate observations),
and asking how well the automatic algorithm performed. The fraction of observations from this ‘‘truth’’
sample that matched with the processed data was 0.982. The fraction of the processed data for which there was
a ‘‘true’’ match was 0.992. Many different algorithms were tried, but the algorithm above performed best
based on the random sample.
Throughout the sample period (1946–1998), in about 3% of the total possible number of elections (based on
the number of seats in the House in each year), no candidate was reported for the election. I impute the
missing values using the following algorithm. Assign the state–year average electoral outcome; if still missing,
assign the state–decade average electoral outcome.
Two main data sets are constructed for the analysis. For all analysis at the Congressional level, I keep all
years that do not end in ‘0’ or ‘2’. This is because, strictly speaking, Congressional districts cannot be matched
between those years, due to decennial redistricting, and so in those years, the previous or next electoral
outcome is undeﬁned. The ﬁnal data set has 6558 observations. For the analysis at the individual candidate
level, one can use more years, because, despite redistricting, it is still possible to know if a candidate ran in
some election, as well as the outcome. This larger dataset has 9674 Democrat observations.
For the sake of conciseness, the empirical analysis in the paper focuses on observations for Democrats only.
This is done to avoid the ‘‘double-counting’’ of observations, since in a largely two-party context, a winning
Democrat will, by construction, produce a losing Republican in that district and vice versa. (It is unattractive
to compare a close winner to the closer loser in the same district.) In reality, there are third-party candidates,
so a parallel analysis done by focusing on Republican candidates will not give a literal mirror image of the
results. However, since third-party candidates tend not to be important in the U.S. context, it turns out that all
of the results are qualitatively the same, and are available from the author upon request.

Appendix B. Comparison of RDD and other estimates of the incumbency advantage
Reviews of the existing methodological literature in Gelman and King (1990), Alford and Brady (1993), and
Jacobson (1997) suggest that most of the research on incumbency are variants of three general approaches—
the ‘‘sophomore surge’’, the ‘‘retirement slump’’, and the Gelman–King index (1990).20 Figs. B1a and b
illustrate the differences between these three approaches and the regression discontinuity strategy employed in
this paper. They also clearly show that the three commonly used approaches to measuring the ‘‘incumbency
advantage’’ are estimating an incumbent legislator advantage as opposed to an incumbent party advantage. The
RDD is ideally suited for estimating the latter incumbency advantage.
Fig. B1a illustrates the idea behind the ‘‘sophomore surge’’. The solid line shows a hypothetical relationship
between the average two-party Democratic vote share in period 2—V 2 —as a function of the Democratic vote
share in period 1, V 1 . In addition, the dotted line just below the solid line on the right side of the graph
represents the average V 2 as a function of V 1 , for the sub-sample of elections that were won by ﬁrst-time
Democrats in period 1.21 The idea behind the sophomore surge is to subtract from the average V 2 for all
Democratic ﬁrst-time incumbents (V 2 ), an amount that represents the strength of the party in those districts
apart from any incumbent legislator advantage. The ‘‘sophomore surge’’ approach subtracts off V 1 , the
average V 1 for those same Democratic ﬁrst-time incumbents.
Fig. B1b illustrates how the ‘‘retirement slump’’ is a parallel measure to the ‘‘sophomore surge’’. In this
ﬁgure, the dashed line below the solid line represents the average V 2 as a function of V 1 , for those districts that
will have open seats as of period 2. In other words, it is the relationship for those districts in which the
Democratic incumbent retires and does not seek re-election in period 2. Here, the idea is to subtract from the
average vote share gained by the retiring Democratic incumbents (V 1 ), an amount that reﬂects the strength of
the party. The ‘‘retirement slump’’ approach subtracts off V 2 , the average V 2 for the incoming Democratic
candidate in those districts.
Fig. B1b also illustrates Gelman and King’s approach to measuring incumbency advantage. The dotted line
above the solid line is the average V 2 , as a function of V 1 , for those districts in which the Democratic
incumbent is seeking re-election. The idea behind their approach is to subtract from the average vote share V 2
gained by incumbents seeking re-election, an amount that reﬂects how the party would perform if a new
candidate ran for the party, while controlling for the lagged vote share V 1 . Thus, the gap between the parallel
dashed and dotted lines in Fig. B1b represent the incumbent legislator advantage measured by the
Gelman–King index (c).22
Finally, Figs. B1a and b illustrate that the approach of the RDD isolates a different aspect of the
incumbency advantage—the incumbent party advantage. The idea is to make a comparison of the
electoral performance in period 2 of the Democratic party between districts that were barely won (say,
by 0.1% of the vote) and districts that were barely lost by the Democratic party in period 1. Thus the
RD estimate (b) is depicted by the discontinuous jumps in the solid lines at the 0.50 threshold in Figs. B1a
and b.23
The ﬁgures show that the discontinuity gap directly addresses the counterfactual question that is at the heart
of measuring the incumbent party advantage: How would the Democratic party have performed in period 2, had
they not held the seat (i.e. had the Democrats lost the election in period 1)? The best way to estimate that
quantity is to examine elections where the Democrats just barely missed being the incumbent party for the
election in period 2—the point on the solid line just to the left of the 0.50 threshold.

20
See Gelman and King (1990) for a concise review of existing methods as of 1990. More recently, Levitt and Wolfram (1997) use a
‘‘modiﬁed sophomore surge’’ approach and Cox and Katz (1996) use a speciﬁcation ‘‘adapted from Gelman and King (1990)’’.
21
In principle, a ‘‘mirror-image’’ line exists for the Republican ﬁrst-time incumbents. But I omit the line to make the graph clearer. Also,
note that in this graph, to simplify exposition, I am assuming that all ﬁrst-time incumbents seek re-election. The basic ideas hold when
relaxing this assumption, but the notation is slightly more cumbersome.
22
Again, the mirror-image dotted and dashed lines for Republicans are ignored to make the exposition clearer in the graph.
23
While it is tempting to equate b here to b2 in equation (6) of Gelman and King (1990), this would be incorrect, because Gelman and
King also include their key variable of interest, I 2 , in the speciﬁcation. (If I 2 were not included, then b2 would be comparable to b here,
provided that the underlying regression function is linear).

It is important to recognize that the incumbent party advantage includes in part the incumbent legislator
advantage, since a Democrat close win, for example, raises the probability that the Democratic nominee runs
for re-election as an incumbent legislator in the next election. It also includes the vote share gain (or loss) that
occurs because the party per se holds the seat.
Nevertheless, it is also important to recognize that in principle, there is no necessary connection between the
RD estimates and the other estimates. It is possible that the RD estimate could be zero (no break in the solid
lines at 0.50), while at the same time the sophomore surge, retirement slump, and Gelman–King index could

ARTICLE IN PRESS
696

be signiﬁcant. Alternatively, in principle, there could be a large estimate of b, while at the same time the other
measures could be zero.
A ﬁnal important point is that the sophomore surge relies upon situations where either an incumbent is
defeated or a seat is thrown open, and the retirement slump, and Gelman–King index relies upon situations
where seats are thrown open by an incumbent that does not seek re-election. In principle, for any year in which
every incumbent becomes the nominee in a re-election bid (and ignoring redistricting years) it would be
impossible to estimate any of those three measures; the dotted and dashed lines in Figs. B1a and b would not
exist. In this case, the only incumbency advantage concept that could be measured would be the incumbent
party advantage identiﬁed by the RDD.
