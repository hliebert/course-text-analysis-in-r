Abstract

Author Manuscript

Different conventional and causal approaches have been proposed for mediation analysis to better
understand the mechanism of a treatment. Count and zero-inflated count data occur in
biomedicine, economics and social sciences. This paper considers mediation analysis for count
and zero-inflated count data under the potential outcome framework with nonlinear models. When
there are post-treatment confounders which are independent of, or affected by, the treatment, we
first define the direct, indirect and total effects of our interest and then discuss various conditions
under which the effects of interest can be identified. Proofs are provided for the sensitivity analysis
proposed in the paper. Simulation studies show that the methods work well. We apply the methods
to the Detroit Dental Health Project’s Motivational Interviewing DVD (DDHP MI-DVD) trial for
the direct and indirect effects of motivational interviewing on count and zero-inflated count dental
caries outcomes.

1 Introduction
Author Manuscript

In many health studies, the intervention is designed to change some post-randomization
(intermediate) variable, such as knowledge, attitudes, behavior, biomarkers or social factors,
so that the change in the intermediate variable will lead to improvement in the final health
outcomes of interest ([1]). For example, the Detroit Dental Health Project’s Motivational
Interviewing DVD (DDHP MI-DVD) trial is a randomized dental trial of a Motivational
Interviewing (MI) intervention to prevent early childhood caries (ECC) in low income
African-American children (0 – 5 years) in Detroit, Michigan ([2]). In the study, caregivers

in both intervention and control groups watched a 15-minute education video on children’s
oral health. The control group (DVD only) was then provided a general recommendations on
diet, oral hygiene and dental visits. For the intervention group (MI+DVD), a MI interviewer
reviewed the child’s dental examination with caregivers, and discussed caregivers’ personal
thoughts and concerns about specific goals for their child’s oral health. A brochure with
caregivers’ specific goals was then printed and placed in a convenient place at home.
Families in the MI+DVD group also received booster calls within 6 months of the
intervention. The study hypothesized that the MI+DVD intervention would change the
caregivers’ and children’s behaviors in oral hygiene and then the behavioral changes would
lead to improved oral health in children. In these studies, researchers are not only interested
if the intervention works but also if and how much the intervention affects the outcome
through and around the intermediate variable. Such an intermediate variable (e.g. caregivers’
behavior change by the intervention in the DDHP MI-DVD study) is usually called a
mediator and the effect of the treatment through the mediator is called indirect or mediation
effect, while the effect around the mediator is called the direct effect. An indirect or
mediation effect shows that the intervention affects the outcome through the intermediate
variables as designed, while a direct effect indicates that the intervention changes the
outcome directly or involving some other intermediate variables in a heretofore
undiscovered mechanism. Knowing those effects helps us to better understand the working
mechanism of an intervention such that in future research and applications in specific
populations, we can tailor specific intervention components to target important mediators
and consequently lead to bigger improvement in health outcomes.

Conventional mediation approaches since Baron and Kenny ([3, 4, 5]) (e.g., regression, path
and structural equation model (SEM)) and recently developed causal methods ([6] – [22])
make different assumptions on the intervention and mediator to achieve a causal
interpretation on the indirect (mediation) effect and direct effect of the intervention through
and around a mediator. Conventional approaches model observed treatment and mediator
values and may not provide a general definition/interpretation of causal effects independent
of specific statistical models. Different from conventional approaches, causal mediation
approaches first conceptually define causal direct and indirect effects under the potential
outcome framework ([23, 24]) without reference to a specific statistical model and then
different statistical models can be used to identify and estimate causal direct and indirect
effects under different assumptions. Most conventional and causal approaches focus on
continuous or binary outcomes. For noncontinuous outcomes such as binary outcomes with
nonlinear models, MacKinnon and Dwyer ([25]) showed that the traditional product method
and difference method give different results, Pearl ([7]) provided general definitions of the
effects, Imai et al. ([26]) discussed general framework and inference, and VanderWeele and
Vansteelandt ([15]) showed that the product method and difference method are
approximately equivalent when the binary outcome is rare under assumptions.
In addition to binary outcomes, the outcome variable in many studies is often a count
following a Poisson or Negative Binomial distribution, or a zero-inflated count that has a
higher probability of being zero than expected under a Poisson or Negative Binomial, such
as number of doctor or emergency visits, number of admissions and readmissions to a
hospital, number of complications, and number of decayed, missing and filled teeth (dmft)

or tooth surfaces (dmfs). The dental outcomes of interest in the DDHP MI-DVD study are
the number of new untreated lesions, dmft and dmfs at the end of the study 2 years later
compared to the DVD group ([2]). Since the majority of the children did not have any new
untreated lesions, dmft and dmfs at the end of the study, the distributions of the outcomes
contain a lot of zeros (Figure 2). In this paper, we will examine whether or not the
intervention did change caregivers’ behavior regarding their children’s oral health (e.g.
parents made sure their children brush teeth) as designed and whether or not the behavioral
changes had an effect on children’s oral health with a mediation analysis.

Assuming a Poisson or Negative Binomial (NB) distribution on dental outcomes such as
dmft and dmfs, Albert and Nelson ([27]) developed a nice approach for estimating different
pathway effects based on the potential outcome framework ([8]) in the context of a directed
acyclic graph (DAG) using generalized linear models, Albert ([28]) considered an inverseprobability weighted estimator for the mediation effect on count outcomes, and Valeri and
Vander Weele ([29]) provided formula for the direct and indirect effects on the rate ratio
scale when the mediator is continuous. Assuming a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB)
model for the outcome, Wang and Albert ([30]) provided a mediation formula for the
mediation effect estimation in a two-stage model and considered a decomposition of the
mediation effect in a three-stage model when there is no post-treatment confounder. In this
paper, we will use the same definitions and general framework as previous work ([7], [15],
[26], [27]) but we are interested in the overall direct, mediation (indirect) and total effects
specifically for count (Poisson and NB) and zero-inflated count (zero-inflated Poisson or
ZIP, and zero-inflated negative binomial or ZINB) data. And as in other work on mediation
on nonlinear models ([7], [15], [26], [27]), we will have the direct effects depend on the
level of the mediating variable and the indirect effects depend on the level of the treatment
variable. In this paper, we will particularly consider cases when there are post-treatment
confounders (independent of or affected by treatment) in a study with count and zeroinflated count data. Various conditions, in addition to Albert and Nelson’s conditional
independence assumption ([27]), will be discussed to identify the effects of our interest with
theoretical proofs. A sensitivity analysis will then be proposed under the cases when there is
post-treatment confounding (see Section 4 for detailed discussion).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we set up the causal framework,
introduce notation and assumptions, and define the indirect and direct effects. In Section 3,
we extend the method to estimate the indirect and direct effect in randomized trials with
count or zero-inflated count outcomes. In Section 4, we present some simulation studies. An
application of our method to the DDHP MI-DVD study is shown in Section 5. Finally, we
provide conclusions and discussion in Section 6.

2 The Framework
In this study, we will use the potential (counterfactual) outcome framework ([23, 24]) to
specify the direct, indirect (mediation) and overall effects of the treatment. We will make the

Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) in the paper. SUTVA says that a
subject’s potential outcome is not related to the randomization or mediation value of other
subjects or the method of administration of randomization or the mediator. Under SUTVA,
we use Zi to denote the treatment variable, Mi for the observed mediator level, Xi for the
observed baseline covariates and Yi for observed outcome for subject i. In a two-arm trial, Zi
= 1 if subject i is randomized to the intervention group and Zi = 0 if randomized to the
control group. We let M iz denote the potential value of a mediator under treatment Zi = z for

subject i, which has two versions M 1i under intervention and M 0i under control. However, in
practice we are not able to observe both potential mediator values but only one of M 1i and M 0i
depending on which treatment group subject i was actually assigned to. We use Y iz, m to
denote the potential outcome subject i would have under the treatment Zi = z and mediator

version of multiple potential outcomes for a subject depending on the actual treatment and

which is the total effect of the intervention (Z = 1) on outcome Y compared to control (Z =
0) no matter whether the effect is through or around mediator M. The total or ITT effect of
the intervention has two components: the effect of the intervention around the mediator,
called the direct effect, and the effect of the intervention through the mediator, called the
indirect or mediation effect. Two sets of definitions on these effects have been proposed in
the literature ([7, 9, 17, 31, 32]): controlled and natural effects.

Alternatively, instead of setting the mediator at a fixed level m in the controlled effects, the
natural effects set the mediator at its “natural” level that would be achieved under treatment
assignment z. The natural direct effect (NDE) of intervention and its average when the
mediator is set at its level under treatment assignment z are

which is the outcome change under treatment z that would be observed if the mediator
would change from the value under control M 0i to the value under treatment M 1i . In some
studies, natural effects are probably preferred since we may not be able to set the mediator at
a specific level. However, stronger assumptions are often needed to identify natural effects
than controlled effects since the potential outcome corresponding to both levels of Z,
z, M iz′

Yi

(z ≠ z′), is involved in natural effects. In this paper, we will focus on the natural effects

while the controlled effects will be mentioned in the discussion of existing approaches.

3 Mediation Analysis for Count and Zero-inflated Count Data
As discussed above, the counterfactual potential outcome involved in the natural effects
z, M iz′

Yi

(z ≠ z′) is not observed. To identify the effects, we assume sequential ignorability as

per Imai et al ([17, 26]):
{Y iz′, m, M iz} ⊥ Z i|X i = x; Y iz′, m ⊥ M iz|Z i = z, X i = x, for all z, z′, m .

Author Manuscript

This assumption says that (a) given the baseline covariates, the treatment is independent of
potential mediators and potential outcomes; and (b) given the treatment and baseline
covariates, the mediators are independent of the potential outcomes. In the DVD-MI study,
the first ignorability assumption is reasonable because participants were randomized to the
MI intervention. The random assignment of the intervention does not guarantee the second
ignorability assumption because the oral health behavior after randomization was not
randomly assigned. However, the second ignorability assumption may hold after
conditioning on baseline covariates and treatment; that is, the oral health behavior was as if
randomized among subjects in the same treatment group who have the same baseline
characteristics.

Under sequential ignorability, Imai, Keele and Tingley ([26]) showed that the distribution of
the potential outcome is nonparametrically identified, i.e., the distribution of the potential
outcome on the left hand side can be expressed as a function of the distribution of observed
data on the right hand side:

|X i = x) =

This result allows us to estimate the potential outcome and mediators we do not observe.
Based on this result, we further assume the following mediator and outcome models:

where the link functions h and g are monotonic and differentiable functions; e.g., identity
link for normally distributed Mi or Yi, and probit link for binary Mi or Yi. For a count
outcome or mediator following a Poisson or Negative Binomial distribution, a loglinear
model can be used as per Albert and Nelson ([27]). For zero-inflated outcomes, different
approaches ([33]) have been proposed outside the mediation context. In this paper, we will
adopt the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) ([34]) or zero-inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB)
([35]) model for zero-inflated counts in the mediation context. The basic idea of these
models is that the outcome is a mixture of zeros and Poisson (or Negative Binomial) random

variables with the mixture proportion p(Z i, M i i, X i) and Poisson (or Negative Binomial) mean
Z

λ(Z i, M i i, X i) depending on the covariates Xi. When an interpretation only relies on the

Author Manuscript

second part (positive outcome) of the ZIP or ZINB model, the conclusion could be
misleading because the two groups with the positive outcome are not ensured to be
comparable by randomization ([36]). In this paper, our estimates of direct, mediation and
total effects and their comparisons between groups will use information from all the
randomized subjects with both parts of the model so that the ignorability of randomization
holds. The outcome distribution under ZIP is:

Then as in Imai et al. ([17, 26]), the procedure based on the quasi-Bayesian Monte Carlo
approximation of King, Tomz, and Wittenberg ([37]) will be used to make inference on the
direct and indirect effects of treatment:
I.

Fit the mediator and outcome models with observed mediator and outcome, and
obtain estimated parameters (coefficients) and their estimated asymptotic
covariance matrix.

Simulate model parameters (coefficients) from their sampling distribution based

the difference between the corresponding two predicted potential
outcomes discussed in Section 2.

Compute the point estimates of direct, mediation and total effects, confidence
intervals and p values based on the results from J repetitions. We use the sample
median, standard deviation, and percentiles of the corresponding distributions
from the J repetitions as the point estimate, standard error and confidence
interval for the direct, indirect (mediation) and total effects.

4 Mediation Analysis with Post Treatment Confounders
In Section 3, we only consider situations with measured baseline confounders Xi. In this
section, we will consider mediation analysis for cases with some confounding after
randomization. For example, in the DDHP MI-DVD study, when we evaluate the effect of
the MI+DVD intervention on children’s dental outcomes around or through whether or not
caregivers made sure their child brushed at bedtime, caregivers’ oral hygiene knowledge and
their own behaviors after randomization could be associated with both whether or not they
made sure their child brushed and children’s dental outcomes and therefore are posttreatment confounders for the mediation analysis of our interest.

Author Manuscript

We let Ui denote post-treatment confounders. Figure 1 shows the treatment mechanism
through and around the mediator when the treatment (a) does not affect and (b) does affect
the post-treatment confounder, respectively.
4.1 Post Treatment Confounders not Affected by the Treatment
When the post-treatment confounder Ui is not affected by treatment Zi (Figure 1(a)), average
natural effects are identified ([32]) under the sequential ignorability (8):
(Y iz′, m, M iZ ) ⊥ Z i|X i = x; and Y iz′, m ⊥ M iz|Z i = z, X i = x, U i = u, for all z, z′, m, u .

(8)

Author Manuscript

The first part of (8) is the same as the first part of (1), which says that the treatment is
randomly assigned conditional on Xi. The second part of (8) is similar to the second part of
(1) except that now the ignorability of the mediator holds given not only the treatment
assignment and baseline covariates but also post-treatment confounders. That is, the
mediator is effectively random (independent of confounding) among subjects in the same
treatment group who have the same values of baseline characteristics and post-treatment
confounders.
To estimate the direct and indirect natural effects of the treatment when the post-treatment
confounder Ui is not affected by treatment Zi, we can modify the outcome model by
including the post-treatment confounder in the model:

4.2 Post Treatment Confounders Affected by the Treatment
When treatment Zi affects the post-treatment confounder Ui (Figure 1(b)), average natural
effects are not identified under assumption (8) without additional information. Instead,
average controlled effects can be estimated under sequential ignorability (8) and the
extended outcome model (10):
Z , Mi

Yi i

∼ f Y (θY = g−1(αY + βY Z i + γ Y M i + ηTY X i + ϕT U i)) .

(10)

The average controlled mediation effect can be estimated by a function of γ Y , but the
estimate of the average controlled direct effect by β Y could be biased ([32]) because Ui is

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

also affected by Zi and the effect through Ui is not incorporated in the estimation of the
controlled direct effect. For continuous outcomes with an identity link function in (10),
Vansteelandt ([38]) and Joffe and Greene ([39]) used a two-stage ordinary least squares
(OLS) procedure to estimate the average controlled direct effect by correcting the bias in the
second stage. Some researchers considered the derivation of bounds for the natural direct
and indirect effects ([40, 41, 42]). Tchetgen Tchetgen and Shpitser ([43]) and VanderWeele
and Chiba ([44]) considered various contrasts of the outcome between two subpopulations as
sensitivity parameters and then corrected the bias with specified values of sensitivity
parameters. Tchetgen Tchetgen and VanderWeele ([45]) assumed monotonicity about the
effect of the treatment (exposure) on the confounder and showed the nonparametrical
identifiability of the natural direct effect. For binary mediators, Taguri and Chiba ([46])
classified subjects into four principal M-response strata and estimated the natural direct and
indirect effects under additional monotonicity assumption on treatment-mediator effect and
assumption of common average mediator effects between compliant and never
intermediates.
In this section, we will consider a sensitivity analysis for the direct and indirect effects on
count and zero-inflated count outcomes when the treatment affects the post-treatment
confounder. We consider the average natural mediation, direct and total effects as:

It is easy to derive that the total natural effect is the sum of natural direct effect under
treatment and natural mediation effect under control similar as Wang and Albert ([28]) and
Imai et al. ([26]). We consider the mediation effect as the causal effect of the treatment on
the outcome through the mediator M under treatment z; and the direct effect as all other
causal effects of the treatment on the outcome around M, including the effect through the
post-treatment confounder U. That is, the confounding effect is included in the direct effect
when it is not the interest. Please see Daniel et al. ([47]) for discussion on various
approaches when more than one intermediate variables exist in a study. When effects
through different intermediate variables are the interest of investigators, Imai and Yamamoto
([48]) assumed a linear structural equation model for the outcome and mediators and
estimated the effects, Daniel et al. ([47]) considered the finest possible decomposition of the
total effect, and VanderWeele and Vansteelandt ([49]) considered the mediators one at a time
as joint mediators and proposed decomposition of the total effect with regression-based and
weighting approaches. For count data, Albert and Nelson ([27]) assumed independence
between one mediator under treatment Z1(1) and under control Z1(0) and then conduct a
sensitivity analysis on pathway effects. In this section, we will consider other practical
assumptions in addition to the conditional independence assumption, under which the direct
and indirect effects are identified. We will also provide theoretical proofs for the effect
identification, and then propose sensitivity analyses under those assumptions.
We assume sequential ignorability (12) and (13) and mediator and outcome models:
Y iz, u, m, M iz′, u′, U iz ⊥ Z i|X i = x

U 0i . Assumption (21) is the similar as the conditional independence assumption on Z1(1) and

Z0(0) in Albert and Nelson ([27]), however, instead of assuming independence between U1
and U0, Assumptions (16) – (18) assume some relation between U1 and U0 and could be
more practical in some real studies.

the mediator model (14) and interactions Z i × M i i and Z i × U i i are included in the outcome
model (15). The procedure based on the quasi-Bayesian Monte Carlo approximation ([37])
discussed in Section 3 can then be used for inference on the direct, mediation and total
treatment effects but with one additional confounder model (16), (17), (18) or (21).

In a real study, we can conduct a sensitivity analysis by varying the values of parameters βU

and τTU one or two at a time and see how the estimates of effects (11) will change. Although

we are not able to know the values of those parameters for sure, information from the study
is helpful for specifying values of those parameters under sequential ignorability (12) and
(13) or (19) and (20). Estimates from a regression of observed Ui on treatment Zi, covariates
Xi and their interaction can provide reasonable starting points for the choice of values for βU

and τTU in the sensitivity analysis. For example, in Ui = αU + δUZi + νUXi + εi, δ U would be
a reasonable starting value for βU in (16). We suggest to use the estimated value based on

1
observables ± c% (say 3 , 50% or 100%) of the estimated value as a range for the parameters,

Author Manuscript

where the choice of c% will be based on expert knowledge in a study such that the range
will represent the possible treatment effect on the confounder. Then equally divided 10–20
values in the range can be used for the sensitivity analysis.

5 Simulation Studies
In this section, we will present simulation studies to examine the finite sample performance
of the methods discussed in Sections 3 and 4.

The treatment Zi was assigned randomly with a probability of 0.5 to either treatment or
control group. The baseline covariates were drawn independently from N(0, 1),
Bernoulli(0.5), and/or multinomial((1, 2, 3, 4), (0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25)). The results are
similar with different types of covariates and only results with the normal and binary
covariates are reported. We consider both continuous and binary mediators:

The true values of the coefficients are not presented in this paper to save space but are
available from the authors. Instead, the true values of NDE, NME and NTE are included in
Tables 1 and 2. Basically the coefficient values were selected such that there would be about
20% zeroes for Poisson and negative binomial data and about 50% zeroes for ZIP and ZINB
data to represent the common data structure in real dental studies (see Figure 2). For each
distribution family, we simulated one setting where the treatment affected the outcome and
about 30% of its effect was through the mediator seen in some real studies ([50]), and
another setting corresponding to the null hypothesis of no direct and indirect effects. For
each setting, we performed 1, 000 Monte Carlo replications, generating data for 100 and 500
subjects respectively on each replication.

The true values of natural direct, indirect (mediation) and total effects were computed as the
average difference between two corresponding potential outcomes with the true values of the
parameters (coefficients). The average estimated values, root mean squared errors (RMSE),
confidence interval coverages, and empirical rejection rates for a level of 0.05 are shown in
Tables 1 and 2 without and with the post-treatment confounder (from (16)) respectively
when there are direct and mediation effects (the alternative hypothesis is true). We can see
that the bias and RMSEs are small under all outcome distributions with and without post
treatment confounders. The 95% confidence interval coverage is good for most cases, but
when there is a post-treatment confounder affected by the treatment, the coverage is less
than 95% for the mediation effect for ZIP and ZINB, where around 40%–70% observations
are zero. The test has higher power to detect direct and total effects than the power to detect
mediation effects, and the power to detect the mediation effect is increased when the sample
size is increased from 100 to 500. A more detailed investigation on the power will be
performed in a future study. When there are no direct and indirect effects (the null
hypothesis is true), the pattern of results is similar with Type I error < 0.05 for all cases (The
results are not shown to save space).

6 Application
In this section, we will conduct an analysis on the DDHP MI-DVD trial ([2]) with the
method discussed in this paper. In the study, 790 families (0–5 years old children and their
caregivers) were randomly assigned to one of two education groups (DVD only or MI
+DVD). In addition to watching a special 15-minute DVD on how the caregivers could help
their children stay free from tooth decay, families in the intervention group (MI+DVD) met a
MI interviewer, developed their own preventive goals, and received booster calls within 6

months of the intervention. Table 3 shows the baseline characteristics of participants by
randomization assignment. The two groups were balanced in age, gender, caregiver
education, household income, soda consumption, dental visit, tooth brushing, and dental
outcomes at baseline.

Author Manuscript

The dental outcomes of interest include the number of new untreated lesions, number of
decayed, missing and filled surfaces (dmfs) and number of decayed, missing and filled teeth
(dmft) at 2 years. The number of new untreated lesions, dmfs and dmft took values of
integers and had around 60%, 26% and 47% zeros respectively. Figure 2 shows the dental
outcome histograms by group at two years. Table 4 shows the results from ordinary analyses
on the randomized trial. Compared to the oral health at baseline, both groups had decreased
number of new untreated lesions, slightly increased dmfs and similar dmft at 2 years. A
logistic regression was used to model the mediator whether or not caregivers made sure their
child brushed at bedtime on intervention, showing that caregivers in the MI+DVD group
were significantly more likely to make sure their child brushed at bedtime at 6 months than
caregivers in the DVD only group (p value=0.0178). Log linear models for Negative
Binomial data were then fitted to model the dental outcomes at 2 years on the intervention,
mediator and their interactions. It is shown that there was no significant difference in dental
outcomes between the MI+DVD and DVD only groups and no significant difference in
dental outcomes between caregivers who made sure and did not make sure their child
brushed at bedtime.

To examine whether or not the behavioral change (e.g. parents made sure their children
brushed teeth) by the intervention had an effect on children’s oral health and whether or not
the intervention had a direct effect on children’s oral health around this behavior change, we
will use methods discussed in this paper to examine the direct and indirect effect of the
intervention on the dental outcomes around or through caregivers’ behavior to make sure
their child brushed at bedtime at 6 months. In this study, the ignorability of treatment is
satisfied because of randomization. Then we will first conduct a mediation analysis
assuming that the ignorability of mediator is plausible after controlling for relevant baseline
covariates, and we will next conduct a sensitivity analysis assuming that there is some posttreatment confounding on the mediator-outcome relation to see how the results will change.
We will control for relevant baseline covariates such as soda consumption, household
income, caregivers’ education, number of times child brushed, whether or not caregivers
made sure their child brushed, whether or not caregivers provided child healthy meals, and
dental visits at baseline. The ignorability of the mediator implies that among those children
who were assigned to the same group and had the same baseline characteristics, whether or
not caregivers made sure their child brushed at bedtime at 6 months were not associated with
confounders. Some empirical work has advocated conditioning on many exogenous
covariates to make a variable more plausibly unrelated with confounding (see [51], [52]
among others). Assuming no post-treatment confounding first, Poisson, Negative Binomial,
zero-inflated Poisson and zero-inflated Negative Binomial outcome models were fitted for
the dental outcomes)number of new untreated cavities, new dmfs and new dmft at two years)
with intervention, mediator, and baseline covariates included in the models. The Vuong test
([53]) was used to compare different outcome models and showed that the zero-inflated
Negative Binomial outcome models were preferred. Table 5 shows the estimated direct,

indirect (mediation) and total effects for the three dental outcomes. None of the direct,
mediation and total effects were significant, indicating no significant evidence that the effect
of the MI+DVD intervention on caregivers making sure children brushed at bedtime
translated to an improvement of dental outcomes at 2 years.

Author Manuscript

When we evaluate the effect of the MI+DVD intervention on children’s dental outcomes
around or through whether or not caregivers made sure their child brushed at bedtime, we
note that the MI+DVD intervention could also affect caregivers’ oral hygiene knowledge and
other behaviors on oral hygiene, which could be associated with both whether or not they
made sure their child brushed at bedtime and their child’s dental outcomes. That is, there
could be some post-treatment confounding on the mediator-outcome relationship. Therefore,
we conduct a sensitivity analysis with methods discussed in Section 4.2 to see how the
results will change. Specifically we modeled a post-treatment confounder (dental visits in
the follow-up) on the treatment and baseline covariates. The estimated intervention effect on
the confounder was −0.15, that is, the intervention had a small effect in reducing dental
visits based on observed data. Although we do not know the real βU in Models (16) – (18)

and (21) because we are not able to observe U 1i and U 0i simultaneously, we use a reasonable
range for βU based on the observed intervention effect on the confounder for sensitivity

analyses. Specifically we use −0.15 ± 13 (−0.15), i.e., (−0.20, −0.10) as the reasonable range

Author Manuscript

for βU in terms of possible intervention effect on the confounder. Figure 3 shows that with
various values of βU, the mediation effects stay around 0 while the direct and total effects
increase and vary within a range from 0.03 for untreated cavities to 0.15 for dmfs. That is,
given that the intervention affected an intermediate confounder (dental visits) at different
levels, the mediation effect of the MI+DVD intervention via caregivers making sure their
child brushed at bedtime stays no effect on children’s dental outcomes, and the direct effect
of the MI+DVD on the dental outcomes around caregivers making sure their child brushed at
bedtime is increased compared to the direct effect given no post-treatment confounding
shown in Table 5 but the effect is not significant (p values > 0.05).
In summary, the MI+DVD intervention significantly increased the likelihood of caregivers
making sure their child brushed at bedtime at 6 months but this effect on caregivers’
behavior did not lead to improved dental outcomes at 2 years compared to DVD only. Future
studies will be needed to design an intervention for behavioral changes leading to improved
dental outcomes.

7 Discussion
Author Manuscript

This paper considers mediation analysis for count and zero-inflated count outcomes –
common outcomes in dental studies and other fields. Sequential ignorability is assumed in
the methods discussed in this paper. Although the mediator is not randomly assigned such
that the ignorability of the mediator is not guaranteed, the assumption is more likely satisfied
after controlling for relevant baseline covariates. See [51], [52] among others for empirical
work showing that conditioning on many covariates makes a variable more plausibly
unrelated with confounding. When we evaluate the direct and mediation effects of the
treatment through a mediator of interest, it is common that there are some other intermediate

variables, which are affected by treatment and also associated with the outcome and
mediator of interest, so called post-treatment confounders. Those post-treatment
confounders make the evaluation of natural direct and mediation effects difficult. In this
paper, we consider mediation sensitivity analysis with the presence of post-treatment
confounders by modeling the post-treatment confounders on treatment and baseline
covariates along with quasi-Bayesian Monte Carlo approximation based g-computation. This
method allows us to evaluate the natural direct and mediation effects with sensitivity
parameters easily specified.

Author Manuscript

In addition to the dental outcomes discussed in this paper, healthcare utilizations such as the
number of doctor visits or emergency visits and number of admissions and readmissions to a
hospital, and medical outcomes such as the number of complications, are often count or
zero-inflated count data. The methods discussed in this paper can be applied to those data.
Important baseline confounders should be controlled in the mediator and outcome models
such that the sequential ignorability is a reasonable assumption. When there is a concern of a
post-treatment confounder which is affected by the treatment, sensitivity analysis proposed
in this paper should be considered to see how the results will change while the sensitivity
parameters vary in a realistic range in the study.
