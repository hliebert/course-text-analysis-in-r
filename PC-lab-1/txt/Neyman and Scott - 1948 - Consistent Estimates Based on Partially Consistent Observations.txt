1. INTRODUCTION

THE present paper contains general definitions and some results re-

lating to a category of problems that appear to be very frequent and
important in many fields of applications, but that thus far have escaped systematic study.

The problems that we have in mind may be labeled as the problems
of consistent estimates based on partially consistent observations. Let xi
stand for a (possibly multivariate) random variable and assume that

the variables of the sequence xi, x2, . . ., xn, * . . are mutually independent. Assume further that the probability laws of the xi contain
some unknown parameters O1, 02, - * * and consider the problem of
consistent estimates of these parameters, that is to say, the problem
of determining such functions Tk(x1, * - * , Xn) of the random variables
that, whatever be e>0, the probability that

(1) I Tk - 0k I > e
tends to zero as n is indefinitely increased.
The recent book of H. Cram6r [1]' summarizes and gives some
very elegant developments relating to the important case where the

number of unknown parameters involved in the probability laws of the
observable random variables is finite and where each parameter appears
in all (or at least an infinite number) of the probability laws. In this

case it could be said roughly that the observable variables {xi are
"consistent." In fact, the knowledge of any one of them tends to contribute something to our knowledge of the totality of the unknown

parameters 01, 02, * - - . This case is obviously very important and for
this reason has attracted attention since Gauss. In particular, we have
the almost universal method of obtaining estimates that are not only
consistent but also asymptotically efficient, in the sense that (1) they
tend to be normally distributed as the number of observations grows
and (2) their variances tend to zero at least as fast as those of any other
estimates. Of course, the method in question is that of maximum likelihood.

Although cases of consistent variables are very important, it is interesting that other cases occur frequently in applications. Of these we

will consider especially cases of variables that we shall describe as
partially consistent. This is the situation where the set of unknown

parameters involved in the totality of probability laws of the random
variables {xi } is infinite and can be split into two parts. The first part

is composed of a finite number of parameters, say O1, 02, - - - , 0,,
each of which appears in the probability laws of an infinity of random

variables of the sequence {x1}. In respect to these parameters 01,
02, * * *, 0. the sequence Xix4 is, then, consistent. The second part of
the set of unknown parameters is infinite and is composed of parameters (m each of which appears in the probability law of only a finite
number of the random variables considered. Thus, in the simplest case,

Sm may appear only in the probability law of Xm, for m= 1, 2,
Alternatively 4i may appear in the probability laws of xi, x2,
Xmj,; 62 in the probability laws of xm,l, . .. , xm1+m2; etc. Since the random variables Xk are allowed to be multivariate, it will be seen that
this particular case does not differ essentially from the first.
Really more complicated cases occur when the parameters ti,
. * * appear in several probability laws in varying combinations,
for example, ti and 62 in the probability law of xi; t2 and t3 in the probability law of x2; etc.
Since it is convenient to have labels for the conceptions studied, the
parameters, 01, 02, . . . , 0, each appearing in an infinity of probability
laws of the observable random variables will be called structural. All

the other parameters, 4, t2, , an infinity of them, will be called
incidental.
This first study will be limited to the case where there is a one-to-one

correspondence between the observable random variables xi and the

incidental parameters (i so that the probability
(i but not on any other incidental parameter.

As to the structural parameters, it will be assumed that the probability law of each xi depends on some of these parameters, but not

necessarily on all of them. Nevertheless, for convenience in formulae,
whenever necessary the probability law of xi will be written with all
the O's appearing as its arguments. To be definite, we will assume that
the observable random variables are all continuous and denote by

Pi(Xi| Ih)1, . , )o ti) the probability density function of xi.
2. EXAMPLES

Before proceeding to results, it may be useful to indicate the generality of the problem by presenting a few examples.
EXAMPLE (1). Let a be some physical constant such as the radial
velocity of a star or the velocity of light.2 Assume that s series of meas-

urements are to be made and let xij stand for the result of the jth
measurement of the ith series (i= 1, 2, . . . I s; j= 1, 2, * * * I n n). We

will assume that the measurements follow the normal law with the
same mean a and an unknown standard error as which may and prob-

ably does vary from one series of observations to another. Thus the

probability density function of xi, is

(2) pij(xij Ia, ai)= e-(xii-a)212i2
oai\/27r

This is exactly the case when a stands for the radial velocity of a

star and the xij are its measurements obtained from ni different spectral lines on the ith plate. With the velocity of light the situation is
similar. This is also the situation in all cases where it is desired to combine measurements of physical quantities, made in different laboratories, by different experimenters, etc.
In order to bring this example into correspondence with the above

description of the general situation, notice that the unknown parameter a appears in all the probability laws of the observable variables.

This, then, is the structural parameter with respect to which the observable random variables are consistent.

In addition to the structural parameter a, each of the probability
laws (2) depends on another unknown parameter o-a. However, there

are only ni probability laws depending on a particular ai. Thus each

i(i1=, 2, * * ) is an incidental parameter. If we use the letter xi
with just one subscript to denote the whole ith series of measurements

(3) xi = { xi, xi2, , Xini II
2 Here we presume that the velocity of light is a constant.

then the correspondence between the example and the general description will be established completely.
EXAMPLE (2). Consider again an increasing sequence of s series of

measurements x,j(i= 1, 2, * - *, s-c> o; j= 1, 2, - - *, ni). Assume aga
that all the measurements are mutually independent and follow a normal law. However, this time it will be assumed as given that the pre-

cision of measurements does not change from one series to another and
is characterized by a single unknown standard error c-. On the other
hand, it will be assumed that the quantity measured in the ith series,

say at, is unknown and does not necessarily equal aA;, that corresponding to the kth series. Thus the probability law of the xij can be written
as

Here we have a partially consistent system of observable random
variables with just one structural parameter and the incidental param-

eters ai. Situations of this kind occur when the same apparatus is
used to make limited amounts of measurements of different quantities

and it is desired to combine all those measurements to obtain a single
estimate of the standard error v-.

Essentially, Example (2) is very similar to Example (1). The reason
for quoting both will be apparent at a later stage when we will discuss
certain phenomena relating to some current methods of obtaining
estimates. Needless to say, both the above examples are of a very
common and familiar type.
EXAMPLE (3). This example will be considered in some detail in a

separate paper by one of the authors. Let t and 77 be two physical q
tities assuming varying values and known to be connected by an

equation of some specified type with a few unknown parameters. For
example, it may be known that -j is a linear function of t

where a and ,B are unknown.

Suppose that in some increasing series of s instances, measurements
of the corresponding values of t and 7 are made. The true unknown
values of t and 77 in the ith instance will be denoted by t} and -qi and the
corresponding measurements respectively by

tributed about the true means ti and 77j resp
cision of measurement of t is always the same o-, and that of 7 is also
always the same O2, both constants o-, and a2 being unknown. The probability density function relating to the ith series of observations will
be written as, say

/ mi m _1 ni sn

(7) Pi = ) (zzi_E)2/20.12 e( 1)(yij-a-ftE)2/20f2
for i=l, 2, *-, s, . It frequently happens that each of the

series of measurements is very short, so that both mi and ni are small
numbers. On the other hand, the number s of independent series is
large and, in principle, can be increased without limit.
Situations of the above kind relate to the familiar problem of "fitting
a straight line when both variables are subject to errors." The problem
is old and was studied by a number of authors from Adcock in 1877

to Abraham Wald [2] who gives an extensive bibliography. Recently,
the problem also was studied by F. H. Seares [3], [4], [5].
Needless to say, the situation described in Example (3) is the

simplest of a broad category of similar situations. The more compli-

cated ones may involve a third variable ti (or more). Also the precision
of measurements may vary from one series to another.
As things stand, the sequence of series of observations (6) is consistent with respect to the parameters, a, A, o, and 2 which are struc-

tural. Besides, there is a system of incidental parameters 1, t, ,
each corresponding to a separate series of observations.
Situations of the kind just described occur frequently in physics

and astronomy where, for example (, and 7i= a+f3ti may stand f
some characteristics of the ith star. It is our impression, however, that
the same theoretical model, perhaps with several more structural and

incidental parameters, is likely to be applicable to some economic
problems. Some sentences in the paper of Wald just quoted seem to

indicate that this would be his opinion also. Similar suggestions were

made by Ragnar Frisch [6].
In this respect two questions seem to be particularly interesting.
First there is the question whether it is reasonable to distinguish between, say, the "true demand" (or some other economic conception)

whose measure at a given moment is given by an incidental parameter

(i, and the "measured demand," expressed by some random variable
xij. Another, probably less important, question is whether more than

one indlependent measurement xij(j= 1, 2, * *, n1) of the same "true
demand" ti is possible. This latter question is connected with the
known fact that, apart from the situation considered by Wald which

may not be of general occurrence, the presence of at least two measure-

ments in each series appears to be necessary for the possibility of consistent estimates of all the structural parameters.

A paper by W. G. Cochran suggests that a similar set-up may have

interesting applications in treating agricultural experiments [7].
EXAMPLE (4). The examples above have a certain common feature.

In each case we have a sequence { xi } of possibly multivariate inde-

pendent variables with the probability laws pi(Xi Il&, e2, ..., i

which depend on all of the structural parameters i1, 2, * , in-

volved in the problem. Example (4) is intended to exhibit a practical
problem in which this is not necessarily the case. Certain important
problems of astronomy, connected with the study of the dynamics of
the galaxy, lead to the following set-up.

With the ith star of a sequence there are connected several, say

three, numbers ai, bi, ci which may be taken as known without error.
For example, they may be known functions of the angular coordinates
of the star which are determined with great accuracy. Next, there are

two quantities ti and r,i which are not measurable with anything like
the precision of the numbers ai, bi, ci.

For example, (i may mean the distance from the star to the sun and
,, the expectation of the radial velocity of the same star when the
component of the sun's motion has been removed. It may be taken as
given that the above quantities are related by the equation

(8) -qi = (i(aai + Abh; + yci),
where a, g, and -y are unknown coefficients, independent of the particular star and relevant to the theory of the dynamics of the galaxy.

Now, instead of the true value of ti we have its measurements

Xily Xi2, *, Ximi which are subject to large errors. The quantity w

not directly measurable either. Instead, we have measurements y,j of
the quantity, say Yi, representing tlhe true radial velocity of the ith

star. The variability of the yij, caused by the errors of measurement, is
appreciable. Moreover, Y, is itself considered as a normal random
variable with its true mean equal to r,i and standard error a- independent of i. It is seen that, in this example, each additional star brings in
several new observable random variables depending on a new parameter (i. Furthermore, the probability law of these additional variables is
generally somewhat different from the previous laws, owing to the
changes in the constants ai, bi, and ci. For example, ai may be equal to
zero for some stars so that these will contribute little to the estimation
of a.

Modern work by the econometric school suggests that similar set-ups
may be applicable in studies of economic phenomena.

3. METHOD OF MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD APPLIED TO PARTIALLY
CONSISTENT OBSERVATIONS

The method of maximum likelihood appears so strong-ly appealing
that, when confronted with a new problem, one tends to apply maxi-

mum likelihood almost automatically. It must be remembered, however, that the various attractive properties of the method were proved
only for consistent series of observations and that, therefore, an automatic extension to other cases may lead to erroneous results. These are
illustrated by the following examples. Naturally, if consistent es-

timates based on partially consistent observations are possible at all,
we may expect them only for structural parameters, because the

incidental parameters appear in the probability law-s of only a finite

number of observable variables. Therefore, the problem of consistency
will be considered in relation to the structural parameters only.

(1) Maximum-likelihood estimates of the str-uctural parameters relating
to a partially consistent series of observations need not be consistent.

To prove this proposition consider the above Example (2). Easy

algebra shows that the maximum-likelihood estimates of all the parameters involved are

Since for every i= 1, 2, - * , s, - - the sample variance Si2 follows the
same law, the arithmetic mean representing 6`2 tends in probability to
the common expectation (13) and thus the maximum-likelihood estimate 62 is not consistent as s-> co,

This is undoubtedly true but beside the point. It will be observed that
(15) is not the nmaximum-likelihood estimate of U2 and that the bias in
the latter, given by (10), does not tend to zero as the series of partially

consistent observation is increased. This is just the circumstance wvhich
the example is meant to illustrate.

(2) Even if the maximum-likelihood estimate of a structural parameter
is consistent, if the series of observations is only partially consistent, the
maximum-likelilhood estimate need not possess the property of asymptotic
efficiency.

To illustrate this point we will consider Example (1) in more detail
[7]. The probability density function of the totality of observable
variables is the product of expressions (2) for j = 1, 2, , ni and
i= 1, 2, , s. Taking the logarithm of this product and differentiat-

ing with respect to a and with respect to vi we get, say

variables are consistent. To establish the consistency of a8 as s-* oo it

As to the maximum-likelihood estimate a, its asymptotic variance is

obtained from (48) by putting wi = ni, say,

Formula (53) can also be written in another way which exhibits its
relation to (52), namely

then the variance ca2 of the maximum-likelihood estimate is always

It is easily seen from (57) that, as s-* c, the ratio fTA.2/Taa2 need not tend
to unity so that, using a familiar phrase, the maximum-likelihood

estimate need not tend to "exhaust all the information supplied by the
sample" and, in fact, may exhaust less of this information than the

alternative consistent estimate A.
Some further facts are interesting to notice. The inequality

(58) aa2 > CA,T2
holds good wherever not all the numbers ni are equal and irrespective
of the values of the ci2. Thus, it may be said that the estimate A8 is
uniformly more efficient than the maximum-likelihood estimate a8.
However, there exist estimates of a which for some particular systems
of values of the U,2 are even more efficient than As,. One such estimate
is given by the simple formula

Since the harmonic mean of any numbers that are not all equal is always less than the arithmetic mean, it follows that, provided n is

Thus, depending on the numbers ni and a,, the variance (60) of the

The application of the elegant inequality of Cram6r-Rao [1], [8 ]
shows that, whatever be an unbiased estimate of a, its variance cannot
be less than the limit

However, the question of whether any unbiased estimate of a or, even,

whether any asymptotically consistent estimate of a whose asymptotic
variance attains the minimum (55) exists, remains open.
To those accustomed to the working of maximum-likelihood estimates both statements (i) and (ii) must appear striking. The authors

must confess that, to their mind, the possible lack of asymptotic efficiency of the maximum-likelihood estimates when they are consistent
appears to be more surprising than the possibility of bias.
4. SEARCH FOR A SYSTEMATIC METHOD OF OBTAINING
CONSISTENT ESTIMATES

Consider the case of some v structural parameters 81, 02, * * ,
where the probability law of each of the successive observable multi-

variate variables xi depends on just one incidental parameter {i which
does not appear in the other laws.
The possibility, or, at least, one of the possibilities, of obtaining
consistent estimates ti(x1, X2, . , x8) of the parameters Es, i = 1,
2, * , v, depends upon the possibility of determining v sequences of
functions, say

(66) F8i = Fi(xi, x2, * *, x8 | 21 2 E)v) for s = 1, 2,**

each depending on Xi, X2, *, Xe and on 81, 02, - * I , 0
on the incidental parameters, and having the following properties. Let

tl, t2, ..., t, stand for continuous sure variables. Let one letter X8
stand for xi, x2, * , x8, one letter T stand for t1, t2, * * *, t, and, finally,

a single letter E3 stand for 01, 02, . - - I 0,.
(a) As s-* o, each function F,i tends in probability to zero, irrespective of the valtes of the parametrs e and (,

The familiar reasoning that leads to the conclusion that the maximum-likelihood estimates are consistent in the case of consistent observations shows that, if the functions F,i satisfy conditions (a), (b),

(74) F,i(Xs I ts,i ts2, .* * t,,) =0 for i = 1, 2, , v

and that each implicit function t,k(X.) will be a consistent estimate
the structural parameter Ek. Pursuing the same analogy we may con-

sider the case where, in addition to (a), (b), and (c), the functions

F8i possess the properties:
(d) The expectations 6(F8i2) exist and, as s-* >o, each ratio

F8i(X8, I 0)\/ )V[F8i2] tends to be normally distributed about z
(e) For each combination of numbers k, j = 1, 2, * * *, v, there

exists a sequence of numbers { B8kj } (s = 1, 2, ) such that all the
differences

(75) A8kj - B8 I;, j

tend in probability to zero.

Under conditions (a) through (e) the solutions tsk of the system of v
equations (68) will have the property that, as s- cc, the joint distribution of

will tend to the v-variate normal law with unit variances. In other
words, O8k2 of (77) will represent the asymptotic variance of t8k.

Should it be possible to determine effectively a class C of groups of

functions F8i, satisfying conditions (a) through (e), then the next problem to consider would be that of finding that particular system of functions of class C for which the variances (77) are the smallest.

Unfortunately, thus far there is no systematic method known to the
authors to determine a broad class of functions satisfying condition (a).
In these circumstances, one might consider abandoning a considerable amount of generality and limiting oneself to special forms of the

functions F8i to which a sufficiently general theorem guaranteeing
that each F8i tends to zero in probability may be applicable. The
theorem in question is, of course, the central limit theorem. lhus we

may consider v systems of functions 4 ij(x0, 0), for j= 1, 2, * * , vI

A proper selection of the weights W,k may assure compliance with

conditions (a) through (e) and, even, reduce the asymptotic variance of

Unfortunately, there are cases where this particular method does not

work. Consider the distribution pi(xi I@, t;) of one variable xi of the
sequence { x, }, and let ui1, ti2j , * * ,n ... be a denumerable sequence of particular values of the incidental parameter ti. For example,
these may be all rational values of the particular parameter. Condition
(72) implies that

(80) f cik(Xi, 0)pi(Xil (9, 1ij)dxi = 0
_00

f or all values of j = 1, 2, n, n, . In other words, the function

bIsk(Xi, )) must be orthogonal to each function of the infinite sequence

{p(x^J I, ij} (j= 1, 2, * * * ). Usually the function (jk will be sought

within some particular class of functions, such as continuous functions,

functions integrable with their squares, etc. It is known that certain

sequences of functions pi may be "closed" within a given class, meaning
that every function of the class that is orthogonal to every function of

the sequence is necessarily equal to zero. It follows that cases are possible, and indeed there are examples known, where the only function
satisfying (78) is zero and, of course, could not be used for estimating

the O's.
The difficulty and, at the same time, the particular interest of the
situation is emphasized by the fact that, thus far, there does not seem

to exist a systematic method of solving the following problem underlying the method under consideration:

Given a function p(x I) defined and nonnegative for every point

p(xx I), the existence of functions 4)(x) satisfying (82) (that is, apart
from the trivial 4_= 0) depends on the number of dimensions n. For
example, if x stands for a system of n independent normal variables all

having the same expectation t and the same variance a=const., it is
known that if n= 1, the only function 4) satisfying (82) is equal to zero

for almost all x. This was proved by Wald [9]. On the other hand, if
n > 2, there is a great variety of functions 4) satisfying (82).

In the absence of a systematic method of determining functions 4)
satisfying (80) the authors can offer the following procedure, which
appears to work in a number of important cases.
5. MODIFIED EQUATIONS OF MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD

Let pi(xi IO0, () stand for the probability density o
variate random variable of the sequence. Let v be the number of struc-

tural parameters 1i, @2, * 0 * , and let pi depend on just one incidental parameter ti that does not appear in pk if k,-?i.
We will assume that the probability density functions pi possess
continuous partial derivatives with respect to all the parameters up to
the second order and allow differentiation under the integral taken over
the whole space of the corresponding multivariate random variable x,.
Write

(83) Oik(Xi E ), {i o = (k = 1, 2, ,v)
and

(84) E) (x1 = - a log= p (i= 1, 2, , s).
Substitute real variables tk for Ok and Xi for {i and write the equations

(85) x I T, X$) = 0,
where T stands for ti, t2, * * *, 1,.
substitute the solution, say

(86)

Xi-=

f(x,

T)

into (83), obtaining

(87) kik[Xi T, f(xi, T)]The function thus obtained depends on xi and on T but not on ti or X;.
Let

(88) E, = {ik [Xi I T, fi(xi, T)]}
be the expectation of (87). There is no guarantee that Eik will be in-

dependent of {i. However, in a number of important cases Eik is either
a constant or else depends on the structural parameters only. In this

latter case write Eik(E) for (88) and build the function, say

(89) I:ik(xi, T) = q5ik(Xi I T, fi(xi, T)) - Eik(T).
Next, taking arbitrary weights Wik, consider the weighted mean
8

(90)

Fsk=

ial

and see whether or not, by a judicious selection of the weights Wik, it
is possible to satisfy the conditions (a) through (e) of the preceding

section. The whole procedure was illustrated when we dealt in detail
with Example (1). If the functions F8k satisfy the conditions stated,
then the system of equations

(91)

F8k=0

(k=

1,2,2

,v)

will define a set of consistent estimates t8k of the structural parameters

Ek, which will be asymptotically normal and will have asymptotic
variances given by (77). However, as already mentioned, an investiga-

tion may reveal that Eik depends on (i and, indeed, that no desirable
function exists for which the expectation is independent of (i.

In the favorable case, i.e., when Eik is independent of tj, the v
equations (91) may be called the modified maximum-likelihood equa-

tions for estimating the E)'s. In fact, equations (91) reduce to ordinary
maximum-likelihood equations when we put Wik-1 and substitute

zero for each Eik. Should the expectations Eik be different from zer
then their omission in (91) may lead to inconsistencies in the estimates
obtained from these equations. This possibility was illustrated above.
Also, one of the examples already discussed shows that the inclusion
and appropriate adjustments of the weights Wik may occasionally lead
to a decrease in the asymptotic variances of the estimates.
6. LOWER BOUND OF THE ASYMPTOTIC VARIANCE

Assume that the consistent estimate, tsk, of Ek, obtained from the
system of equations (91) is unbiased, i.e., such that its expectation
is identically equal to ek. In this case the Cram6r-Rao inequality [1],

[81, [10], gives the lower bound, u02(s, k), of the variance Us8k2 of t8

and A8kk its appropriate minor. Thus, final
unbiased estimated of ok must satisfy the inequality

(98) 08k2 > a-.2(, k) - A8k,/A8.
Generally, the estimates obtained from equations (91) will not be

unbiased, but subject to a milder restriction of consistency. However
their asymptotic variance given by (77) ordinarily remains bounded
from below by (98).

This is a direct consequence of the following Lemma which generalizes somewhat the Cramer-Rao inequality. The proof applies to
random variables satisfying the conditions enumerated in the Lemma
and is not restricted to partially consistent systems.

Remark. In order to perceive the connection between this Lemma and
the problem of the lower bound 0o2 of the variance of a consistent estimate t8k of a structural parameter Ok, notice that, in cases described

in the previous section, the asymptotic variance of tak, formula (77),
has exactly the form of the left-hand side of (108). If, as frequently
occurs, the functions F8, in the equation (74) are arithmetic means of

type (90), then as s-> , the derivatives F,ik will tend in probability
to these expectations and then the quantity B8kj of (75) and (77) will

correspond to the ratio Gkj/G of (108). Of course, the determinant A
of (109) is perfectly analogous to A' of (95).

The first term in (114) is equal to L(k) in (108). Now we use assump-

ing (105) with respect to 0j we obtain

(115) f (Ftj + Fioj)p(X, 0, t)dX_ 0.
Hence

But the equations (119) imply

Therefore L(k) - Akk/A > 0 which proves the Lemma.

Usingr the above Lemma, we may now formulate a theorem relating
to variances of consistent estimates t8k of structural parameters as
described in the previous section.

THEOREM 1. If the functiions F8,(X8 GI) of (66) satisfy the conditio
(a), (b), (c), (d) and if, as s- co, the differences [F8sk(X8 I3) -E6(F8k)

tend to zero in probability, then the asymptotic variance of the estimate

t8k obtained from (74) of the parameter Gk ((k = 1, 2, * , v) is at least
equal (o the ratio oo2(s, k) = Akk/A.
7. CASES OF IMPAIRED AND UNIMPAIRED ASYMPTOTIC EFFICIENCY

As is well known, if the observable random variables are consistent
and certain mild restrictions are satisfied, then the lower bound pro-

vided by the Cramer-Rao inequality is always attained by the asymptotic variances of the consistent estimates of the parameters. For ex-

ample, the maximum-likelihood estimates possess this property.

It is interesting to note that in cases of partial consistency of the
observable variables, this need not be so and, whatever the functions

F8k used to compute the consistent estimates, the asymptotic varianc
Usk2 may always be greater than the limit (98). Here we have to distinguish three cases. First it may happen that not only 08k2> 0O2(s, k)
but also the upper limit as s-* cc of the ratio U8k2/rO2(s,; k) may be
greater than unity. In cases of this kind we shall say that the asymptotic efficiency is essentially impaired by the presence of the incidental

parameters. The second case is that where the inequality s8k2 > a02(s, k)
is combined wXith the equality

unimpaired efficiency, it is necessary and sufficient that

The proof of Theorem 2 follows immediately from the remark made
in the course of proving the Lemma of the preceding section. This is
to the effect that, for the value of I of (112) to be equal to zero it is
both necessary and sufficient that the equality (113) be satisfied almost
everywhere.

THEOREM 3. For the existence of a system of v equations F8,(XI T) = 0

with. respect to T yield the consistent estimate tBm of the parameter e)m of
unimpaired efficiency, ztt is necessary and suficient (a) that for almost

observable variables and the structural parameters but are independent of

be found such that the system of Tj (j= 1, 2, * * *, I) satisfies the conditions of Theorem 1. Then the unimpaired estimate of (m will be obtained

from the system of equations 'j(XX, T) =0 (j= 1, 2, * , ).
The necessity of the conditions enumerated follows directly from

Theorem 2. In fact, if the system of equations FOi(XJ| T) =0 (i= 1,
2, *., ) satisfying the conditions of Theorem 1 and yielding an unimpaired estimate of e)m exists, then (124) must be satisfied for almost
all X8 and thus it must be possible to represent (125) in the form (126)

with the function TJ coinciding with the functions F8i(X. I 0). In orde

to prove the sufficiency of the conditions, assume that the system of

and it is seen that the coefficients A j must have the form (130). But
then, by Theorem 2, the asymptotic variance of the estimate of t8m

derived from the equation Tj = 0 must be equal to the lower bound
provided by the Cramer-Rao inequality.
Theorem 3 provides easy means of determining equations yielding
unimpaired estimates of the structural parameters, if they exist. The

procedure is as follows. Write down in a column the expressions of the
logarithmic derivatives of the joint distribution of all the variables
forming a partially consistent system. Next to this column write the

matrix of the A81k' for k = 1, 2, . . . , v+s and 1= 1, 2, . . , v. Referring
to notation (83), (84), (94), and (95) we have

Next form the sum of products of the logarithmic derivatives by the corresponding terms of the first column of the matrix. If this sum splits

into not more than v terms of the form A jTj where the functions
satisfy the conditions of Theorem 3, then it is possible to obtain an

estimate of @) having unimpaired efficiency. Similar trials with columns 2, 3, , v of the matrix will answer the same question relating

It is possible that the sum of products, say

with v' <v. Then, even if the v' functions Tj satisfy the necessary conditions, the problem appears of supplying an additional v-v' functions

Tj such that the whole system of v equations T(X8, T) = 0 yields co
sistent estimates of all the structural parameters. Theorem 3 guarantees that, in whatever way these v' additional functions are selected,
provided the whole system satisfies the conditions of Theorem 1, the

resulting estimate of E)m will have unimpaired efficiency. This circumstance indicates the desirability of a system that satisfies condition
(134) for as many different values of m as possible. Of course, the source

of the additional v - v' equations is the system of modified maximumlikelihood equations described above. It is interesting that cases exist
where one of the several structural parameters can be estimated with

unimpaired efficiency, but not the others. A case of this kind is discussed below.
8. ILLUSTRATIONS

The present paper originated from the work of one of the authors,
relating to the problem of fitting a straight line when both variables are

subject to error. The general statement of this problem is given in
Section 2 as Example (3) and the results of the complete solution will
be published elsewhere. Further below a particular case of the problem

is considered in some detail. The purpose of this analysis is to illustrate
some of the points of the preceding section, namely, (i) the process
of determining equations yielding an unimpaired estimate of one of the
structural parameters and (ii) the fact that, on occasion, one of the

several structural parameters may admit an unimpaired estimate, but
not the others.
In order to illustrate these facts, a special case of the problem of

fitting a straight line is chosen for consideration in this paper. This
case is somewhat artificial and of minor practical importance. This,
however, does not diminish its illustrative value.

The case considered is that where, in the notation adopted in the

description of Example (3), Section 2, mi = m and ni = n for i = 1,

where A is a coefficient depending on a but independent of the random

all the xij and all the yij respectively. It is seen that expression (140)
does not split into a sum of type (126) of at most two components. On
the other hand, expression (141) is itself a product of a function of the
observable variables and of just one unknown structural parameter,

namely y. . - a- fx.., by a coefficient A, which does not depend on

the random variables. Moreover, the function y. . - a - Ox.. has its
expectation equal to zero, as s-* it tends to zero in probability and
its derivative with respect to a is a constant. The conclusions are: (i)
there is no system of equations satisfying the conditions of Theorem 1

which yield an unimpaired estimate of c2; (ii) an unimpaired estimate,
