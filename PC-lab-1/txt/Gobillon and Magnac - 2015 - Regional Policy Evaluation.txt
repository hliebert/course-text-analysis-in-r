REGIONAL POLICY EVALUATION: INTERACTIVE FIXED EFFECTS AND
SYNTHETIC CONTROLS
Laurent Gobillon and Thierry Magnac*
Abstract—In this paper, we investigate the use of interactive effect or linear
factor models in regional policy evaluation. We contrast treatment effect
estimates obtained using Bai (2009) with those obtained using difference
in differences and synthetic controls (Abadie and coauthors). We show
that difference in differences are generically biased, and we derive support
conditions for synthetic controls. We construct Monte Carlo experiments
to compare these estimation methods in small samples. As an empirical
illustration, we provide an evaluation of the impact on local unemployment
of an enterprise zone policy implemented in France in the 1990s.

Introduction

I

T is becoming more and more common to evaluate
the impact of regional policies using the tools of program evaluation derived from microsettings (see Blundell
& Costa-Dias, 2009, or Imbens & Wooldridge, 2011, for
surveys). In particular, enterprise and empowerment zone
programs have received renewed interest in recent years (see
Busso, Gregory, & Kline, 2013; Ham et al., 2012; Gobillon,
Magnac, & Selod, 2012). Those programs consist of a variety of locally targeted subsidies aiming primarily at boosting
local employment or the employment of residents. Their
evaluations use panel data and methods akin to difference
in differences that offer the simplest form of control of local
unobserved characteristics that can be correlated with the
treatment indicator. Nonetheless, specific issues arise when
studying regional policies and the tools required to evaluate
their impact or to perform a cost-benefit analysis are different
from the ones used in more usual microsettings.
The issue of spatial dependence between local units is
important in the evaluation of regional policies. Outcomes
are likely to be spatially correlated in addition to the more
usual issue of serial correlation in panel data. There is
thus a need for better control of spatial dependence and,
more generally, of cross-section dependence when evaluating regional policies. This is why more elaborate procedures
than difference in differences are worth exploring; the use
of factors or interactive effects proved to be attractive
and fruitful in microstudies (Carneiro, Hansen, & Heckman, 2003). Interactive effect models facilitate the control

for cross-section dependence not only because of spatial
correlations but also because areas can be close in economic
dimensions that depart from purely geographic characteristics. This is the case, for instance, when two local units
are affected by the same sector-specific shocks because of
sectoral specialization even if these units are not neighbors.
Second, a key issue in policy evaluation is that treatment
and outcomes might be correlated because of the presence
of unobservables. It should also be acknowledged when
using regional data that those unobservables characterizing
local units might be multidimensional because the underlying cycles of economic activities of local units are likely to
be multiple. Interactive effect models are aimed precisely at
allowing the set of unobserved heterogeneity terms or factor
loadings that are controlled for to have a moderately large
dimension.
Moreover, the estimation of linear factor models in panels is relatively easy, and asymptotic properties of estimates
are now well known (Pesaran, 2006; Bai, 2009). Yet there
are only a few earlier contributions in the literature that conduct regional policy evaluations using factor models (Kim &
Oka, 2014) or using a kindred conditional pseudo-likelihood
approach (Hsiao, Ching, & Wan, 2012).
The contributions of this paper are threefold. We first
provide results concerning the theoretical setup. We clarify
restrictions in linear factor models under which the average
treatment on the treated parameter is identified. We analytically derive the generic bias of the difference-in-differences
estimator when the true data-generating process has interactive effects and the set of factor loadings is richer than the
standard single-dimensional additive local effect. Moreover,
we derive from the literature conditions on the size of treatment and control groups, as well as on the number of periods
under which factor model estimation delivers consistent
estimates of the average treatment on the treated parameter.
Contrasting the estimation of linear factor models with the
alternative method of synthetic controls is our second contribution. This alternative method, proposed by Abadie and
Gardeazabal (2003), and its properties have been developed
and vindicated in a model with factors (Abadie, Diamond,
& Hainmueller, 2010). Under the maintained assumption
that the true model is a linear factor model, we show that
synthetic controls are equivalent to interactive effect methods whenever matching variables (i.e., factor loadings and
exogenous covariates) of all treated areas belong to the support of matching variables of control areas, which is assumed
to be convex, a case that we call the interpolation case. This
is no longer true in the extrapolation case, that is, when
matching variables of one treated area at least do not belong
to the support of matching variables in the control group.

THE REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS

Our third contribution is that we evaluate the relevance and
analyze the properties of interactive effect, synthetic control, and difference-in-differences methods by Monte Carlo
experiments. We use various strategies for interactive effect
estimation. First, a direct method estimates the counterfactual for treated units by linear factor methods in a restricted
sample where posttreatment observations for treated units
are excluded. The second method estimates a linear factor model that includes a treatment dummy and uses the
whole sample. Propensity score matching underlies the third
method in which the score is conditioned on factor loading
estimates obtained using the first method. Imposing common support constraints on factor loadings when estimating
the counterfactual for treated units by linear factor methods
provides the fourth method. We contrast these Monte Carlo
estimation results with the ones we obtain by using synthetic
controls and difference in differences.
We finally provide the results of an empirical application of these methods to the evaluation of the impact of
a French enterprise zone program on unemployment exits
at the municipality level in the Paris region. This extends
our results in Gobillon et al. (2012) in which we were using
conditional difference-in-differences methods. We show that
the estimated impact is robust to the presence of factors and
therefore to cross-section dependence. We also look at other
empirical issues of interest, such as the issue of missing data
about destination when exiting unemployment and the more
substantial issue of the impact of the policy on entries into
unemployment.
In the next section, we briefly review the meager empirical
literature in which factor models are used to evaluate regional
policies. We construct in section III the theoretical setup and
write restrictions leading to the identification of the average
treatment on the treated in linear factor models. Next, we
derive the bias of difference in differences and describe the
linear factor model estimation procedures. We derive the
conditions that contrast their properties with those of synthetic control methods. Monte Carlo experiments reported
in section IV are used to evaluate the small sample properties of the whole range of our estimation procedures. The
empirical application and estimation results are presented in
section V, and the last section concludes.
II.

Review of the Literature

To our knowledge, there are only two earlier empirical
contributions, by Hsiao et al. (2012) and Kim and Oka (2014)
that apply factor models to the evaluation of regional policies. Interestingly, both papers motivate the use of factor
models by contrasting them to the difference-in-differences
approach. Hsiao et al. (2012) use an interactive effect model
to study the effect on Hong Kong’s domestic product of
two policies of convergence with mainland China that were
implemented at the turn of this century. Their observations
consist of various macroeconomic variables measured every
quarter over ten years for Hong Kong and countries either

in the region or economically associated with Hong Kong.
The authors argue that interactive models can be rewritten as
models in which interactive effects can be replaced by summaries of outcomes for other countries at the same dates
using a conditioning argument. Indeed, common factors can
be predicted using this information, but this entails a loss of
information since information at the current period only is
used to construct these predictions.
Interestingly, Ahn, Lee, and Schmidt (2013) analyze an
interactive effect model, and their method, which consists
of differencing-out factor loadings, provides potential efficiency improvements over the procedure of Hsiao et al.
(2012). The authors indeed show that the parameters of interest are solutions of moment restrictions that do not depend
on individual factor loadings. Assuming out any remaining
spatial correlation, they show that their GMM estimates are
consistent for fixed T .
Kim and Oka (2014) estimate an interactive effect model
following Bai (2009) and provide a policy evaluation of
the impact of changes in unilateral divorce state laws on
divorce rates in the United States. They find that interactive
effect estimates are smaller than difference-in-differences
estimates and show that the estimation of interactive effect
models can bridge the gap between weighted (by state population) and unweighted estimates, which was a cause for
debate in the applied literature on the effects of divorce laws.
Overall, in a large N and T environment, the most
prominent estimation methods were proposed by Pesaran
(2006), who uses regressions augmented with cross-section
averages of covariates and outcomes, and by Bai (2009) who
uses principal component methods. Westerlund and Urbain
(2015) review quite extensively the differences between
these methods.

Theoretical Setup

Consider a sample composed of i = 1, . . . , N local units
observed at dates t = 1, . . . , T . A simple binary treatment,
Di ∈ {0, 1}, is implemented at date TD < T so that for
t  TD > 1, the units i = 1, . . . , N1 are treated (Di = 1).
Units i = N1 + 1, . . . , N are never treated (Di = 0). For
each unit, we observe outcomes, yit , which might depend on
the treatment, and our parameter of interest is the average
effect of the treatment on the treated. In Rubin’s notation,
we denote by yit (d) the outcome at date t for an individual i whose treatment status is d (where d = 1 in case
of treatment and d = 0 in the absence of treatment). This
hypothetical status should be distinguished from random
variable Di describing the actual assignment to treatment
in this experiment.
The average effect of the treatment on the treated can be
written when t ≥ TD :
E (yit (1) − yit (0) |Di = 1 )
= E (yit (1) |Di = 1 ) − E (yit (0) |Di = 1 ) .

(1)

REGIONAL POLICY EVALUATION

A natural estimator of the first right-hand-side term is its
empirical counterpart since the outcome in case of treatment is observed for the treated at periods t  TD . In
contrast, the second right-hand-side term is a counterfactual
term since the outcome in the absence of treatment is not
observed for the treated at periods t  TD . The principle
of evaluation methods relies on using additional restrictions to construct a consistent empirical counterpart to the
second right-hand-side term (Heckman & Vytlacil, 2007).
For instance, it is well known that difference-in-differences
methods are justified by an equal trend assumption,
E(yit (0) − yi,TD −1 (0) | Di = 1)
= E(yit (0) − yi,TD −1 (0) | Di = 0) for t ≥ TD ,

(2)

under which the counterfactual can be written as
E (yit (0) |Di = 1 ) = E(yit (0) − yi,TD −1 (0) | Di = 0)
+ E(yi,TD −1 (0) | Di = 1) for t ≥ TD ,
in which all terms on the right-hand side are directly
estimable from the data.
The object of this section is to generalize the usual setup in
which difference in differences provide a consistent estimate
of the effect of the treatment on the treated (TT) to a setup
allowing for higher-dimensional unobserved heterogeneity
terms. Local units treated by regional policies could indeed
be affected by various common shocks describing business
cycles related, for instance, to different economic sectors.
Associated factor loadings would describe the heterogeneity in the exposure of local units to these common shocks.
A single-dimensional additive local effect as in the setup
underlying difference-in-differences estimation is unlikely
to describe this rich economic environment. Furthermore,
we know that difference in differences can dramatically
fail when heterogeneity is richer than what is modeled
(Heckman, Ichimura, & Todd, 1997).
In this paper, we restrict our attention to linear models because the number of units is rather small, although
extensions to nonlinear settings could follow the line of
Abadie and Imbens (2011) at the price of losing the simplicity of linear factor models. The route taken by Conley
and Taber (2011) to deal with small-sample issues might also
be worth extending to our setting. More specifically, linearity
makes one wary of issues of interpolation and extrapolation,
which we highlight in the general framework of linear factor models, as well as in the approach of synthetic controls
proposed in the seminal paper by Abadie and Gardeazabal
(2003).
We present in section IIIA the specification of a linear
factor data-generating process, which is maintained throughout the paper, and we discuss identifying assumptions. We
show that the conventional difference-in-differences estimate is generically biased. Next, for a linear factor model that
includes a treatment indicator, we derive a rank condition
for the identification of the average treatment on the treated.

537

We also propose a direct method whereby we construct the
counterfactual term in equation (1) using the samples of control and treated units, albeit the latter before treatment only
(see Heckman & Robb, 1985, or Athey & Imbens, 2006).
Finally, we describe the approach of synthetic controls and
analyze its properties when the true model has interactive
effects.
A. Interactive Linear Effects and Restrictions
on Conditional Means

In the conventional case of difference in differences (DID)
(see Blundell & Costa-Dias, 2009), the outcome in the
absence of treatment is specified as a linear function,
yit (0) = xit β + λ̃i + 
δt + εit ,

(3)

in which xit is a 1 × K vector of individual covariates and
λ̃i and 
δt are individual and time effects. A limit to this
specification is that individuals are all affected in the same
way by the time effects. To allow interactions and make the
specification richer, we specify the outcome in the absence
of treatment as a function of the interaction between factors
varying over time and heterogeneous individual terms called
factor loadings as
yit (0) = xit β + ft λi + εit ,

(4)

in which β are the effects of covariates, λi is a L × 1 vector
of individual effects or factor loadings, and ft is an L × 1
vector of time effects or factors. Note that this specification
embeds
which is obtained when
model,
 the usual additive


λi = λ̃i , 1 and ft = 1,
δt , as in that case, ft λi = λ̃i +
δt .
The true process generating the data is supposed to be
given by equation (4) and is completed by the description of
the outcome in case of treatment,
yit (1) = yit (0) + αit ,

(5)

which, in contrast to the linear specification above, is not
restrictive.
A few usual assumptions complete the description of the
true data-generating process (DGP) maintained throughout
the paper. First, we assume that we know the number of
factors in the true DGP described by equation (4). It might
be useful to implement tests regarding the number of factors
(Bai & Ng, 2002; Moon & Weidner, 2015), but these tests
are fragile (Onatski, Moreira, & Hallin, 2013). Moreover, we
adopt the assumption that factors are sufficiently strong so
that the consistency condition for the number of factors and
consequently for factors and factor loadings is satisfied (for
alternative views, see Onatski, 2012, or Pesaran & Tosetti,
2011). This condition reflects the fact that factor loadings
can be separated from the idiosyncratic random terms at the
limit.1
1 It does not mean that the treatment parameter is not identified under
alternative assumptions.

THE REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS

Moreover, we do not specify the dynamics of factors in
the spirit of Doz, Giannone, and Reichlin (2012). Their specification imposes more restrictions on the estimation and
inference is more difficult to develop. This is why we stick to
the limited information framework, which does not impose
conditions on the dynamics of factors, although it could
be done in the way explained by Hsiao et al. (2012). Furthermore, the only available explanatory variables are not
varying over time in our empirical application. This corresponds to the low-rank regressor assumption defined by
Moon and Weidner (forthcoming) and under which identifying assumptions are of a particular form. At this stage,
however, we prefer to stick to the more general format.
A final comment is worth making. In treatment evaluation, lagged endogenous variables are at times included as
matching covariates in order to control for possible ex ante
differences. In spirit, this is very close to a model with interactive effects because it is well known that a simple linear
dynamic panel data model like
yit = αyit−1 + ηi + uit

yit (0) ⊥ Di | (xi , λi ) ⇔ εit ⊥ Di | (xi , λi ),
and we write this condition as a mean independence restriction:
Assumption 2:
E(εit | Di , λi , xi ) = E(εit | λi , xi ).
Note that we do not suppose that (λi , xi ) and Di are uncorrelated and selection into treatment can freely depend on
observed and unobserved heterogeneity terms.
Finally, define the average treatment effect over the
periods after treatment as
αi =

T

1
αit ,
T − TD + 1 t=T
D

can be rewritten as a static model,


yit = αt yi0 + 1 − αt

Second, we extend the usual assumption made in differencein-differences estimation by assuming that the conditioning
set now includes unobserved factor loadings,

ηi
+ νit ,
1−α

in which νit is an AR(1) process. Factors are αt and 1 − αt ,
ηi
and factor loadings are yi0 and 1−α
. This argument could be
generalized to more sophisticated dynamic linear models.
Restrictions on conditional means. To complete the
description of the true data-generating process, we now
present and comment on the main restrictions on random
terms. To keep notation simple and conform with the usual
panel data setup, we generally consider that factors ft are
fixed, while factor loadings λi are supposed to be correlated
random effects.
We first assume that idiosyncratic terms εit are orthogonal
to factor loadings and that explanatory variables are strictly
exogenous,2

) is a [T , K] matrix. This would
in which xi = (xi1
be without loss of generality when orthogonality is defined
as the absence of correlation as in Bai (2009). Because
of the next assumption, we prefer to interpret orthogonality as mean independence and the formal translation of the
informal statement above is therefore that:

so that our main parameter of interest is the average treatment
on the treated over the periods after treatment defined as:3
Definition ATT:
α = E(αi | Di = 1) =



E(αit | Di = 1).
T − TD + 1 t=T
D

Assumptions 1 and 2 are the main restrictions in our setup,
and definition ATT defines our parameter of interest.
B. The Generic Bias of Difference-in-Differences Estimates

If the true data-generating process comprises interactive effects, we now show that the difference-in-differences
estimator is generically biased, although we exhibit two
interesting specific cases in which the bias is equal to 0.
For simplicity, we omit covariates in this section or, since
covariates are assumed to be strictly exogenous, implicitly
condition on them. We also assume for simplicity that the
probability measure of factor loadings in the treated population, dG(λi | Di = 1), and in the control population,
dG(λi | Di = 0), are dominated by the Lebesgue measure
so that both distributions are absolutely continuous.
We shall show that the condition implied by assumption 2,4
E(yit (0) − yi,TD −1 (0) | Di = 1, λi )
= E(yit (0) − yi,TD −1 (0) | Di = 0, λi ) for t  TD , (6)

Assumption 1:
E(εit | λi , xi ) = 0.
2 The extension to the case with weakly exogenous regressors would
follow Moon and Weidner (forthcoming), for instance.

3 In the case T → ∞, those definitions should be interpreted as limits.
Note also that it is generally easy to design estimates for time-specific treatment parameters such as E(αit | Di = 1) by restricting the posttreatment
observations to period t only.
4 This condition is slightly weaker than assumption 2 because it considers
differences between periods.

REGIONAL POLICY EVALUATION

does not imply equation (2) under which the difference-indifferences estimator is consistent. Indeed:

E(yit (0) − yi,TD −1 (0) | Di = 1)

= E(yit (0) − yi,TD −1 (0) | Di = 0, λi )r(λi )

E(yit (0) − yi,TD −1 (0) | Di = 1)
× dG(λi | Di = 0),


= E E(yit (0) − yi,TD −1 (0) | Di = 1, λi ) | Di = 1

which in turn implies that
= E(yit (0) − yi,TD −1 (0) | Di = 1, λi )dG(λi | Di = 1).

E(yit (0) − yi,TD −1 (0) | Di = 1)

= E(yit (0) − yi,TD −1 (0) | Di = 0, λi )
(7)

Two special cases are worth noting. First, the integrand in the
previous expression does not depend on λi in the restricted
case in which there is a single factor ft = 1 and a single individual effect associated with this factor. In this case, equation
(7) can be written as
E(yit (0) − yi,TD −1 (0) | Di = 1)



= E(yit (0) − yi,TD −1 (0) | Di = 0)

dG(λi | Di = 1)

= E(yit (0) − yi,TD −1 (0) | Di = 0),
which yields equation (2) describing equality of trends.
Alternatively, (perfectly) controlled experiments also
enable identification through difference in differences in
spite of using the alternative argument that dG(λi | Di =
1) = dG(λi | Di = 0). The same equation (2) holds, and the
treatment parameter is consistently estimable by difference
in differences.
This implication is not true in general, and we can distinguish two cases. If the conditional distribution of λi in
the treated population is dominated by the corresponding
measure in the control population,
∀ the Borel set Λ, Pr(λi ∈ Λ | Di = 0) = 0
=⇒ Pr(λi ∈ Λ | Di = 1) = 0,

(9)

E(yit (0) − yi,TD −1 (0) | Di = 1)
= E(yit (0) − yi,TD −1 (0) | Di = 0)


+ Cov yit (0) − yi,TD −1 (0), r(λi ) | Di = 0 .

Replacing the integrand using equation (6) yields

× dG(λi | Di = 1).

539

(8)

the support of treated units is included in the support of nontreated units. We shall describe from now on cases in which
support condition (8) holds as an instance of interpolation
and, if such a condition is not satisfied, as an instance of
extrapolation.
In the interpolation case, let
dG(λi | Di = 1)
r(λi ) =
< ∞,
dG(λi | Di = 0)
which is well defined because of the support condition (8)
and because distributions are absolutely continuous. Write
equation (7) as

The second term on the right-hand side can be interpreted
as the differential trend in outcomes due to the time-varying
effects of factors interacted with unobserved factor loadings.
If there is indeed a factor loading associated with a timevarying factor, the second term is not equal to 0 except under
special circumstances, as seen above. In the interpolation
case, the second term describes the bias in DID estimates.
In the alternative case of extrapolation, the bias term is
derived in a similar way, although its interpretation is less
clear since it mixes issues of noninclusive supports with the
time-varying effect of factors.
C. Interactive Effect Estimation in the Whole Sample

We now explore interactive effect methods and exhibit
conditions under which these methods allow the identification of the average treatment on the treated parameter. The
observed outcome verifies
yit = yit (0)(1 − It Di )+yit (1)It Di ,
in which Di is the treatment indicator, and It = 1{t ≥ TD }
is a time indicator of treatment. Using equations (4) and (5)
yields
yit = αit It Di + xit β + ft λi + εit .

(10)

We maintain assumptions 1 and 2 that allow the correlation between Di and λi to be unrestricted so that selection
into treatment can depend on factor loadings. Similarly, the
correlation between It and ft is unrestricted so that the implementation of the treatment can be correlated with economic
cycles that are described here by factors.
We rewrite equation (10) as
yit = αIt Di + xit β + ft λi + εit + (αit − α)It Di ,

(11)

in which α is the average treatment on the treated parameter
as in definition ATT. Nonetheless, if the number of periods
after treatment is greater than 1, this model would not deliver
unbiased estimates because of omitted variables. Indeed, we
could rewrite model (10) as
yit = αt It Di + xit β + ft λi + εit + (αit − αt )It Di ,

(12)

540

THE REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS

allowing for a time-varying treatment effect:

This condition is also sufficient. This is because

E(Di )I[1:T
] MF I[1:T ] is invertible using condition (15) and
because we can show that

αt = E(αit | Di = 1).
The omitted variables in equation (11) would be the T −
TD period indicators interacted with the treatment indicator
(except 1). For simplicity, we develop our analysis in this
section in the simple case in which we have
Assumption 3:
∀t ≥ TD ,

αt = α,

so that equation (11) is correctly specified.5
We now exhibit further conditions under which α can be
identified using interactive effect procedures as proposed by
Bai (2009). We start with the case β = 0, which requires a
weak rank condition, and then extend it to the general case
with covariates that require an additional assumption that is
stronger, albeit easy to interpret.
Average treatment effect on the treated in the absence of
covariates. We shall prove that the parameter of interest α
is identified under the two conditions that It is not equal to
a linear combination of factors ft and that the probability of
treatment is positive.
We keep considering that T is fixed, as well as factors
ft and treatment It , and we investigate identification as if
factors ft were known. This argument extends to the case in
which T tends to infinity by taking limits.
Stack individual observations in individual vectors of
dimension [T , 1],

yi = αDi I[1:T ] + F  λi + εi + Δi I[1:T ] Di ,

(13)

in which yi = ( yi1 , ., yiT ) , I[1:T ] = (I1 , ., IT ) , F = ( f1 , ., fT ),
εi = (εi1 , ., εiT ) and Δi is a diagonal matrix of dimension
[T , T ] whose diagonal terms are (αi1 − α, . . . , αiT − α). Set
MF = I − F  (FF  )−1 F, and multiply the previous equation
to obtain
MF yi = αDi MF I[1:T ] + MF εi + MF Δi I[1:T ] Di .

(14)

A necessary condition for identifying α using equation (14)
stacked over the different individual units is therefore

I[1:T
] MF I[1:T ] > 0 and E(Di ) > 0.

(15)

This means that I[1:T ] is not equal to a linear combination of
factors and that the probability of being treated is positive.
This is related to the rank condition underlying the identification of parameters in proposition 3 in Bai (2009, p. 1259).
Furthermore, this condition is also necessary in equation (13)
because the correlation between λi and Di is unrestricted.
5 The identification of equation (12) can be established using similar
developments. The proof is available on request.

Indeed, the covariance between the two right-hand-side
terms of equation (14), the regressor Di MF I[1:T ] , and the error
term MF εi + MF (αi − α)I[1:T ] Di is equal to 0. There are two
terms in this covariance that we analyze in turn.
The first term is equal to 0 by construction (assumption
2) because


E(I[1:T
] MF Di MF εi ) = E(I[1:T ] MF Di MF E(εi | Di )) = 0,
(17)

since Di is a scalar random variable and variables in the time
dimension are supposed to be fixed.
The second term of the covariance above is more interesting and involves

E(I[1:T
] MF Di MF Δi I[1:T ] Di )

= E(I[1:T

(18)

which is equal to 0 by construction of Δi since E(Δi | Di =
1) is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal terms are
E(αit − α | Di = 1) = αt − α = 0,
by assumption 3. The covariance in equation (18) is then
equal to 0.

Finally, multiplying equation (14) by I[1:T
] MF Di and taking the expectation gives equation (16). This ends the proof
that the average treatment on the treated parameter α is
identified under rank condition (15).
The Case with Covariates. In the general case with
covariates, we can write equation (11) as

yi = αDi I[1:T ] + xi β + F  λi + εi + Δi I[1:T ] Di .
Multiplying this equation by MF , we obtain
MF yi = αDi MF I[1:T ] + MF xi β + MF εi + MF Δi I[1:T ] Di .
(19)
Denote the linear prediction of Di as a function of xi as
Di = vec(xi ) γ + Dix ,
and rewrite equation (19) as
MF yi = αDix MF I[1:T ] + MF ε̃i + MF Δi I[1:T ] Di ,

(20)

in which ε̃i = εi + xi β + α.vec(xi ) γI[1:T ] . Because xi and
vec(xi ) are uncorrelated with Dix , the same noncorrelation
condition as in equation (17) is valid since we have from

REGIONAL POLICY EVALUATION

assumptions 1 and 2 that E (εi |Di , xi ) = 0. Thus, the second condition derived from equation (18) that remains to be
checked refers to the equality to 0 of

= E(Δi I[1:T ] Di Di ) − E((Δi I[1:T ] Di vec(xi ) γ)
= −E(Δi I[1:T ] Di vec(xi ) γ),
because of the argument employed after equation (18) that
uses definition ATT. This term is equal to 0 under the
sufficient condition given by
∀t ≥ TD ,

E(αit | Di = 1, xi ) = E(αit | Di = 1),

since it implies that
E(Δi | Di = 1, xi ) = E(Δi | Di = 1) = 0,
by assumption 3 and definition ATT as above. This condition is stronger than necessary as it would be sufficient
to condition on the scalar variable vec(xi )γ.6 Note also that
the interactive effect model could be generalized by conditioning on covariates in an unrestricted way or interacting
covariates with the treatment indicator, and this would substantially weaken this condition as in the static evaluation
case (Heckman & Vytlacil, 2007).
Consistency and other asymptotic properties of this
method can be derived from Bai (2003) when N −→ ∞
and T → ∞. Note also that condition (15) also implies
that N1 tends to ∞ when N −→ ∞. Estimation could also
proceed with the estimation method proposed by Ahn et al.
(2013) and thus dispense with the assumption that T → ∞.
Note that when T is small, Bai’s estimator is inconsistent
unless errors are white noise (Ahn, Lee, & Schmidt, 2001).
Remarks. First, when we let the number of periods
grow, it is interesting to consider again the difference-indifferences estimator that might be consistent when T → ∞
even if the sufficient conditions of section IIIB are not
fulfilled.7 In the absence of covariates, the difference-indifferences estimator is the OLS estimator of the demeaned
equation,

yit − y.t − yi. + y..
= α(Di − D. )(It − I. ) + ( ft − f. ) (λi − λ. ) + ε̃it ,
in which the notation “.”, which replaces an index, points at
the average of the variable running over this index, say, for
instance, yi. = T1 Tt=1 yit and ε̃it is the demeaned version of
the errors. When N → ∞, the bias in the OLS estimator of
this equation converges to a term that is proportional to
6 In this case, developments following Wooldridge (2005) might be
appropriate, but we do not follow up on this route in this paper.

As assumed above, we generically have plimN→∞ N1 i,t (Di −
D. )(λi − λ. ) = 0 because the correlation between Di and λi
is different from 0. Even in this case, the DID estimate can
nonetheless be consistent when T → ∞ if

This condition states that in the long run, treatment and factors are uncorrelated, yet this is not an assumption that one
would like to make in all policy evaluations.
Second, it is interesting to develop the reverse of the
underspecified case developed in section IIIB. Overspecification arises when a factor model is estimated while the
true data-generating process is that of a standard panel with
additive individual and time effects. We speculate that results
of Moon and Weidner (2015) might be used to show that not
only there is no bias but also there is no loss of precision
when using a greater number of factors than necessary, at
least asymptotically.
D. Direct Estimation of the Counterfactual

Assumptions 1 and 2 imply that a direct estimation strategy for the effect of treatment on the treated can also be
adopted. Estimate first the interactive effect model (4) using
the sample composed of nontreated observations over the
whole period and of treated observations before the date of
the treatment t < TD . Orthogonality assumption 2 makes
sure that excluding observations (i, t) with i ∈ {1, ., N1 } and
t ≥ TD does not generate selection. Second, orthogonality assumption 1 renders conditions stated by Bai (2009)
valid, and the derived asymptotic properties of linear factor
estimates hold.
Various asymptotics can be considered:

•
•

If N and T tend to ∞, then β, ft , and λi for the nontreated
are consistently estimated (Bai, 2009).
If the number of periods before treatment TD tends
to ∞, then λi for the treated units are consistently
estimated.

As for the counterfactual term to be estimated in equation
(1), we have for t  TD ,


(22)
E (yit (0) |Di = 1 ) = E xit β + λi ft |Di = 1 .
To estimate this quantity, we replace parameters λi , i =
1, . . . , N1 , β and ft when t  TD by their consistently estimated values in the right-hand-side expression (computed

542

THE REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS

as detailed in the online appendix) and take the empirical
counterpart of the expectation. Namely, the treatment on the
treated at a given period is derived by using equation (1) and
can be written as
E (yit (1) − yit (0) |Di = 1 )
= E(αit | Di = 1)


= E (yit (1) |Di = 1 ) − E xit β + λi ft |Di = 1 , (23)
and its estimate is obtained by replacing unknown quantities by their empirical counterparts. The average treatment
on the treated effect is then obtained by exploiting definition ATT and averaging equation (23) over the periods after
treatment.8
An additional word of caution about identification is in
order since the rank conditions (15) developed in the previous section are also necessary. The second condition of
equation (15), E (Di ) > 0, is straightforward while the first
condition in that equation is not as simple to derive. This is
summarized in proposition 1.
Proposition 1. Suppose that the first rank condition in
equation (15) does not apply and that the treatment vector
I1:T is a linear function of factors,
I1:T = F  δ,
in which δ is an [L, 1] vector and F is the matrix of factors
as defined above. Then for any value of the treatment effect
α, there exists an observationally equivalent factor model in
which the value of the treatment effect is equal to 0.
Proof. Let α be any value and write equation (13) as
yi = αI1:T Di + F  λi + ε̃i ,
in which ε̃i includes any idiosyncratic variation of the treatment effect across individuals and periods. By replacing
I1:T = F  δ, we get
yi = αF  δDi + F  λi + ε̃i ,
= F  (αδDi + λi ) + ε̃i ,

in which the distinction between observed variables xi and
unobserved variables λi does not matter. Let μi = p(xi , λi )
denote the propensity score.
The condition above suggests the following strategy:
1. Estimate factors and factor loadings using the sample
of controls and the subsample of treated observations
before treatment as detailed in section IIID.
2. Regress Di on xi and λ̂i , and construct the predictor of
the score μ̂i .
3. Match on the propensity score à la Heckman,
Ichimura, and Todd (1998) or, under some conditions,
use a single factor model associated to μ̂i .
F. Synthetic Controls

The technique of synthetic controls proposed by Abadie
and Gardeazabal (2003) and further explored by Abadie,
Diamond, and Hainmueller (2010, ADH thereafter) proceeds
differently. It focuses on the case in which the treatment
group is composed of a single unit and uses a specific matching procedure of this treated unit to the control units whereby
a so-called synthetic control is constructed. We proceed in
the same way, although as we have potentially more treated
units, we repeat the procedure for each of them and then
aggregate the result over various synthetic controls to yield
the average treatment on the treated.9
Presentation. We follow the presentation by ADH
(2010). An estimator of yit (0) for a single treated unit
i ∈ {1, ., N1 } after treatment t ≥ TD is the outcome of a synthetic control “similar” to the treated unit that is constructed
as a weighted average of nontreated units. We impose the
similarity of characteristics xit between treated units and
synthetic controls by weighting characteristics xjt of control
units, j ∈ {N1 + 1, ., N} in such a way that

This shows the necessity of condition (15) for the estimation method derived in this section, as well as for any other
estimation method analyzed below.

Similarity between pretreatment outcomes is also
imposed in ADH (2010),

E. A Single-Dimensional Factor Model

It is well known since Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) that
conditions 1 and 2 imply the condition
E(εit | Di = 1, p(xi , λi )) = 0,

9 An alternative would be to aggregate the treated units into a single
unit first. By analogy with what is done in nonparametric matching, this
procedure seems more restrictive because using a single synthetic control
leads to less precise estimates than when constructing various synthetic
controls. Nonetheless, support conditions for the validity of the synthetic
control method that we find might justify such an approach because support
requirements are weaker in the aggregate case.

REGIONAL POLICY EVALUATION
TD −1
where yj(k) =
t=1 kt yjt is a weighted average of pretreatment outcomes in which k = (k1 , ., kTD −1 ) are weights
differing across periods (yi(k) for the treated unit is defined
similarly). A set of such pretreatment outcome summaries
can be generated using various vectors of weights, k. Nevertheless, the most general setting is when we consider all
pretreatment outcomes, yjt , for t = 1, . . . , TD − 1. Indeed,
taking linear combinations of pretreatment outcomes or
considering the original ones is equivalent in this general
formulation, and we dispense with the construction of yj(k)
and yi(k) .

In practice, one needs to determine the weights that allow the
construction of the synthetic control. Weights should ensure
that the synthetic control is as close as possible to the treated
unit i and thus that conditions (24) and (25) are verified.
Denote zj = (yj1 , ., yj,TD −1 , xj1 , ., xjT ) (resp. zi ) the list of
variables over which the synthetic control is constructed (i.e.,
pretreatment outcomes and exogenous variables). Weights
are computed using the following minimization program,

Note that the construction of the synthetic control by equation (29) is allowed to be imperfectly achieved and the
discrepancy is captured by the terms ηit and ηitX . We thus
acknowledge that characteristics of the treated unit, zi =
(yi1 , ., yi,TD −1 , xi1 , ., xiT ) , might not belong to the convex hull,
CU , of the characteristics of control units. First, there are
small sample issues when the number of pretreatment periods, TD − 1, and of covariates, KT , is larger than the number
of untreated units, N − N1 . In other words, the convex hull
CU lies in a space whose dimension is lower than the number of vector components, TD − 1 + KT . Second, and more
important, even if TD − 1 + KT < N − N1 , vector zi might
not belong to this convex hull because supports of characteristics for treated and control units differ. Terms ηit and ηitX
capture this discrepancy.
We now analyze what consequences this construction has
on the estimation of the treatment effect. The estimated
treatment effect given by equation (26) is a function of
N


(27)

in which M is a weighting matrix.10 Note that the resulting
weight ω(i) is a function of the data (zi , zN1 +1 , ., zN ).
Synthetic controls and interactive effects. We now
describe this procedure in an interactive effect model setting
as first suggested by ADH (2010). Nonetheless, we show
that the absence of bias implies constraints on the supports
of factor loadings and exogenous variables and is related to
the developments in section IIIB.
To proceed, we need to introduce additional notation. Our
linear factor model can be written at each time period as

Yt (0) = β Xt + ft ΛU + εt for the untreated,
yit (0) = β xit + ft λi + εit for each treated individual,
(28)
10 M



where ΛU = λN1 +1 , . . . , λN is (L, N − N1 ) and ft is a L
column vector. Similarly, Yt (0) and εt are (N − N1 ) row
vectors, and Xt is a(N − N1 , K) matrix.

Weights ω(i) = ω(i)

can be chosen in various ways (see Abadie et al., 2010, for some guidance). In our case, we set M to the identity matrix. There could also exist
multiple solutions to this program if the treated observation belongs to the
convex hull of the controls. Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2015) suggest using a refinement by selecting the convex combination of the specific
points that are the closest to the treated observation (see their footnote 12).

= αit + yit (0) − Yt (0) ω(i)
= αit + ηit ,
in which we have extended definition (29) to all t ≥ TD . The
absence of bias for the left-hand side estimate with respect
to E (αit ) can thus be written as E(ηit ) = 0. To write this
condition as a function of primitives, we need to replace
dependent variables by their values in the model described
by equation (28). This gives
ηit = yit (0) − Yt (0) ω(i)
= β xit + ft λi + εit − (β Xt + ft ΛU + εt )ω(i) ,
= β (xit − Xt ω(i) ) + ft (λi − ΛU ω(i) ) + εit − εt ω(i) .
Considering that β and ft are fixed and taking expectations
yields
E(ηit ) = β E(xit − Xt ω(i) ) + ft E(λi − ΛU ω(i) )
+ E(εit − εt ω(i) ),
β E(xit − Xt ω(i) ) + ft E(λi − ΛU ω(i) ),
in which we have used the result derived by ADH (2010) that
E(εit − εt ω(i) ) tends to 0 when the number of pretreatment

544

periods TD tends to ∞.11 This expression should be true for
any value of β and ft and the absence of bias thus implies
that
E(xit − Xt ω(i) ) = 0 and E(λi − ΛU ω(i) ) = 0.

(30)

The following sufficient condition is established in the
appendix:
Lemma 1. If the support of exogenous variables and factor
loadings of the treated units is a subset of the support of
exogenous variables and factor loadings of the nontreated
units and this latter set is convex and bounded, then condition
(30) is satisfied at the limit when N − N1 → ∞.
We call this the interpolation case, and this relates to
the familiar support condition in the treatment effect literature and to the domination relationship between probability measures in the treated and control groups seen in
equation (8).
If the support of controls does not contain the support of
treated observations, the synthetic control method is based
on extrapolation since it consists of projecting λi and xit onto
a convex set to which they do not belong, and this generates
a bias. For instance, to compute the distance between λi
and the convex hull of the characteristics of the controls
denoted conv (ΛU ), we could use the support function (see
Rockafellar, 1970) and show that

in which λj is the jth column of ΛU . Statistical methods
to deal with inference in this setting could be derived from
recent work by Chernozhukov, Lee, and Rosen (2013), but
this is out of the scope of this paper.
More generally, synthetic control is a method based on
convexity arguments and thus needs assumptions based on
convexity. The case of discrete regressors is a difficult intermediate case between interpolation and extrapolation that
inherits the “bad” properties of extrapolation. In consequence, we conjecture that the synthetic cohort estimate is
generically biased.
IV.

Monte Carlo Experiments

A. The Setup

The data-generating process is supposed to be given by a
linear factor model,
yit = αi It Di + ft λi + εit ,
11 The main difficulty there is to take into account that ω is a random
function of zi and zj

in which the treatment effect, αi , is homogeneous or heterogeneous across local units but not time and the number
of factors, L, is variable. We always include additive individual and time effects (i.e., λi = (λi1 , 1, λi2 , ...) and ft =
(1, ft1 , ft2 ...) ) as most economic applications would require.
We did not include any other explanatory variables than the
treatment variable itself.
The data-generating process is constructed around a baseline experiment and several alternative experiments departing from the baseline in different dimensions, such as the
distribution of disturbances, the assumption that they are
identically and independently distributed (i.i.d.), the number
of local units and periods, the correlation of treatment assignment and factor loadings, the structure of factors, the support
of factor loadings, and the heterogeneity of the treatment
effect, αi . Experiments are described in detail below or in
the online appendix. The Monte Carlo aspect of each experiment is given by drawing new values of {εit }i=1,.,N,t=1,.,T only,
and the number of replications is set to 1,000.
In the baseline, individual and period shocks εit are
i.i.d. and drawn in a zero-mean and unit-variance normal
distribution.
The number of treated units, N1 (resp. total, N) and the
number of periods before treatment, TD (resp. total, T ), as
well as the number of factors L, are fixed at relatively small
values in line with our empirical application developed in
the next section, and more generally, with data used in the
evaluation of regional policies. In the baseline experiment,
we fix (N1 , N) = (13, 143), (TD , T ) = (8, 20), and L = 3
(including one additive factor). We also experiment with L
varying in the set {2, 4, 5, 6}.
The values of factors ft and factor loadings λi are drawn
once and for all in each experiment. Factors ft , for t = 1, ., T ,
are drawn in a uniform distribution on [0, 1] (except the first
factor, which is constrained to be equal to 1). Alternatively,
we also experiment by fixing the second factor in ft to the
value a sin(πt/T ) with a > 0 large enough.
The support of factor loadings, λi , is the same for treated
units as for untreated units in our baseline experiment. They
are drawn in a uniform distribution on [0, 1] (except the second factor loading, which is constrained to be equal to 1). In
an alternative experiment, we construct overlapping supports
for treated and untreated units. This is achieved by shifting the support of factor loadings of treated units by .5 or,
equivalently, by adding .5 to draws. In another experiment,
supports of treated and untreated units are made disjoint by
shifting the support of treated units by 1. Because the original support is [0, 1], this means that the intersection of the
supports of treated and nontreated units is now reduced to a
point. Note that adding .5 (resp. 1) to draws of treated units
spawns a positive correlation between factor loadings and
the treatment dummy Di equal to .446 (resp. .706).
In the baseline experiment, the treatment effect is fixed to
a constant, αi = .3, which is a value close to ten times the
one obtained in our empirical application.

REGIONAL POLICY EVALUATION
B. Estimation Methods

We evaluate six estimation methods:
1. A direct approach using pretreatment period observations for control and treated units and posttreatment
periods for the nontreated only to estimate factors ft
and λi in the equation
yit (0) = ft λi + εit ,

(31)

as in section IIID. The estimation procedure follows
Bai’s method and is based on an EM algorithm,
which is detailed in online appendix A.1. A parameter estimate of α is then recovered from equation (23)
replacing the right-hand-side quantities by their empirical counterparts. This estimator is labeled “interactive
effects, counterfactual.”
2. An approach whereby we estimate parameter α applying Bai’s method to the linear model in which a
treatment dummy is the only regressor,
Yit = αIt Di + ft λi + εit ,
as in section IIIC. The resulting estimator is labeled
“interactive effects, treatment dummy.”
3. A matching approach (section IIIE) by which equation (31) is first estimated as in the first estimation
method. This yields estimates of λi from which a
propensity score discriminating treated and untreated
units is computed. We use a logit specification for the
score and construct the counterfactual outcome in the
treated group in the absence of treatment at periods
t  TD using the kernel method proposed by Heckman
et al. (1998). If we denote the score predicted by the
logit model by μ̂i , the counterfactual of the outcome
for a given treated local unit i at a given posttreatment
period is constructed as

for t  TD ,
where Kh (·) is a normal kernel whose bandwidth is
chosen using a rule of thumb (Silverman, 1986). An
estimator of the average treatment on the treated is the
average of yit − 
E (yit (0) |Di = 1 ) over the population
of treated local units for dates t  TD . The resulting
estimator is labeled “interactive effects, matching.”
4. An approach similar to “interactive effects, counterfactual” in which we impose the constraint λi =
ΛU ω(i) for any unit i when estimating equation (31).
ΛU is the L × (N − N1 ) matrix comprising untreated
factor loadings, and ω(i) are weights obtained in the
synthetic control method. The estimation method is

545

detailed in online appendix A.2 and the estimator of α
is recovered from equation (23), replacing right-handside quantities by their empirical counterpart. This
estimator is labeled “interactive effects, constrained.”
5. The synthetic control approach (section IIIF), whereby
the average treatment on the treated is obtained by
averaging equation (26) over the population of treated
units. The resulting estimator is labeled “synthetic
controls.”
6. A standard difference-in-differences approach whereby
we compute the FGLS estimator taking into account
the covariance matrix of residuals (written in first difference). Recent research presented in Brewer, Crossley, and Joyce (2013) suggests that this is the appropriate procedure if assumptions underlying difference
in differences are satisfied. The resulting estimator is
labeled “diff-in-diffs.”
In our simulations, the number of iterations for Bai’s
method involved in methods 1 to 4 is fixed to 20, and
the number of iterations for the EM algorithm involved in
method 1 and 4 is fixed to 1. When an estimation method
using Bai’s approach is implemented, we use the true number
of factors.12
C. Results

Our parameter of interest is α, and we report the empirical
mean bias, median bias, and standard error of each estimator for every Monte Carlo experiment. Results in the
baseline case are presented in column 1 of table 1 and,
unsurprisingly, show that the estimated treatment parameter
exhibits little bias for all methods controlling for interactive factors: “Interactive effects, counterfactual,” “Interactive
effects, treatment dummy,” “Interactive effects, matching,”
“Interactive effects, constrained” and “Synthetic controls.”
Similarly, the difference-in-differences method, is unbiased
in spite of not accounting for interactive factors since factor loadings are orthogonal to the treatment indicator in the
baseline experiment.
Interestingly, among methods allowing for interactive
factors, those with constraints are the ones achieving the
lowest standard errors (“Interactive effects, constrained” and
“Synthetic controls”) since using constraints that bind in
the true model increases power. Note also that the standard error is larger when using the method “Interactive
effects, counterfactual” than when using the method “Interactive effects, treatment dummy” as the structure of the true
model after treatment in the treated group is not exploited.
Difference-in-differences standard errors lie between those
values.
In columns 2 and 3 of table 1, we report results when shifting by .5 or 1 the support of individual factors for the treated.
12 Monte-Carlo simulations are implemented in R. Weights ω(i) in methods
4 and 5 are computed using the R procedure “lsei” and the minimization
algorithm “solve.QP.”

These shifts have two consequences. First, the validity conditions are now violated for interactive effect estimation,
which uses support constraints (“Interactive effects, constrained”), and for synthetic controls. Second, they make
factor loadings correlated with the treatment dummy. Results
show that all methods are severely biased except “Interactive effects, counterfactual,” “Interactive effects, treatment
dummy,” and, more surprising, difference in differences. The
two first methods are designed to properly control for interactive effects and factor loadings whatever the assumption
about supports or about correlations between factor loadings and treatment. The bias for “Diff-in-diffs” is close to
0 because the correlation between the factors and time indicators of treatment is close to 0 (see equation [21]). We
investigate further below the bias in a case in which they are
correlated.
The method “Interactive effects, matching” does not work
well because nontreated units close to treated units in the
space of factor loadings are hard to find since the support
for the treated has been shifted. We thus abstain from reporting the related results. As expected, the bias obtained for
“Interactive effects, constrained” and “Synthetic controls” is
large. These methods indeed impose that individual effects
of treated units can be expressed as a linear combination
of individual effects of nontreated units. These constraints
are violated with a positive probability when the treated unit
support is shifted by .5, and they are always violated when
the support is shifted by 1.
To investigate further the cause of the surprising small
bias of “Diff-in-diffs” in the previous table, we modified the
structure of factors in the experiment. The first factor in ft

Data-generating process: Number of observations: (N1 , N) = (13, 143); number of periods: (TD , T ) =
(8, 20); number of individual effects (including an additive one): L = 3; treatment parameter: α = .3;
one interactive time effect is the deterministic sinusoid 5. sin (πt/T ); other time effects and individual
effects of the nontreated drawn in a uniform distribution [0, 1]; individual effects of the treated drawn in
a uniform distribution [0 + s, 1 + s] with s ∈ {0, .5, 1} reported at the top of column; errors drawn in a
normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.
Estimation methods are detailed in section IVA. S = 1,000 simulations are used. The average (resp.
median) estimated bias is reported in bold (resp. italic). The empirical standard error is reported in brackets.

is now fixed to 5 sin(πt/T ), and this implies that factors
and time indicators of treatment, It , are now correlated.13
Table 2 shows that the “Diff-in-diffs” method can generate
much larger biases in this alternative setting while biases
of other methods remain the same. It is even the case that
small sample biases of “Interactive effects, counterfactual,”
and “Interactive effects, treatment dummy” become smaller
in this alternative experiment.
We then make the number of individual effects vary
between two and six (including one individual additive effect) to assess to what extent the accuracy of
estimates decreases with the number of factors. Results
reported in table 3 show that for the first three methods—
“Interactive effects, counterfactual,” “Interactive effects,
treatment dummy,” and “Interactive effects, matching”—the
bias does not vary much and remains below 10%. Interestingly, whereas the standard error markedly increases with the
number of factors for the method “Interactive effects, counterfactual,” it increases much more slowly for the method
“Interactive effects, treatment dummy.” This occurs because
factor loadings of the treated are estimated using pretreatment periods only in the former case, whereas in the latter
case, all periods contribute to the estimation of factor loadings. When using methods with constraints “Interactive
effects, constrained” and “Synthetic controls,” the bias can
be larger than 10%, but standard errors remain small. As in
the baseline case, the bias of “Diff-in-diffs” is rather small,
13 This

correlation disappears when T → ∞ as noted by a referee.

although we know from the previous analysis that changing
the structure of factors could make the bias larger.
Two interesting conclusions in this analysis bear on
our empirical application. First, the method of “Interactive
effect, counterfactual” seems to be dominated in terms of
bias and precision by the method “Interactive effect, treatment dummy” in all experiments, and we thus retain only
the second method. Second, the three methods “Interactive effects, matching,” “Interactive effects, constrained,”
and “Synthetic controls” seem to behave similarly. Therefore, we retain only one method, synthetic controls, for our
application.
D. Other Experiments

In online appendix B, we detail additional Monte Carlo
simulation results when the distribution of errors is uniform,
when there are fewer pretreatment and posttreatment periods,
and when the number of local units is larger. Results conform
with intuition.
We also report there, results when disturbances are not
i.i.d. Heteroskedasticity is introduced by drawing variances
from a distribution with two points of support, with probability 1/2 for each point. We change the ratio of the two variance
values across experiments. Alternatively, serial dependence
is modeled as autoregressive of order 1, and we change serial
correlation across experiments. This allows us to show that
the number of periods that we considered T = 20 in line
with our empirical application below is sufficiently large for
the asymptotic results developed in Bai (2009) to be valid.
We find very little evidence of bias, and the asymptotic variance of estimates obtained in the i.i.d. setting is a rather good
approximation to the experimental variance. In other words,

547

small sample biases shown by Ahn et al. (2001) could be
neglected when T = 20.
V.

Empirical Application

Our application is motivated by the evaluation reported in
Gobillon et al. (2012) of an enterprise zone program implemented in France on January 1, 1997. A survey of enterprise
zone programs in the United States and the United Kingdom
is presented in this article, as well as many particulars that
we do not have the space to develop here. The fiscal incentives given by the program to enterprise zones were uniform
across the country and consisted of a series of tax reliefs on
property holding, corporate income, and, above all, wages.
The key measure was that firms needed to hire at least 20%
of their labor force locally (after the third worker hired) in
order to be exempted from employers’ contributions to the
national health insurance and pension system. This is a significant tax exemption that represents around 30% of whole
labor costs (gross wage). It was expected that this measure
would affect labor demand for residents of these zones and
decrease unemployment. This is why we analyze the impact
of such a program on unemployment entries and exits over
this period.
We restrict our analysis to the Paris region in which nine
enterprise zones (Zones franches urbaines) were created
in 1997. Municipalities or groups of municipalities had to
apply to the program, and projects were selected taking into
account their ranking given by a synthetic indicator. This
indicator, whose values have never been publicly released,
aggregates five criteria: the population of the zone, its unemployment rate, the proportion of young people (less than 25
years old), the proportion of workers with no skill, and finally
the income level in the municipality in which the enterprise zone would be located. An additional criterion is that
the proposed zone should have at least 10,000 inhabitants.
Nevertheless, the views of local and central government representatives who intervened in the geographic delimitation
of the zones also played a role in the selection process. It
thus suggests that although the selection of treated areas
should be conditioned on the criteria of the synthetic indicator, it is likely that there is sufficient variability in the
selection process due to political tampering. As a consequence, assumptions underlying matching estimates are not
a priori invalid if observed heterogeneity is controlled for.
Indeed, the supports of the propensity score in treated and
nontreated municipalities largely overlap, though there are
some outliers, as shown in online appendix C.3.
In Gobillon et al. (2012), we provided evidence that controlling for the effect of individual characteristics of the
unemployed when studying unemployment exits only moderately affects the treatment evaluation. This is why we use
raw data at the level of each municipality in this empirical
analysis. Furthermore, the destination after an unemployment exit, to either a job or unemployment, is quite uncertain
in the data since an unemployment spell is often terminated

548

THE REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS

because the unemployed worker is absent at a control. Many
exits to a job might be hidden in the category “Absence at
a control.” The empirical contribution of our paper is that
we investigate not only exits to a job, as in Gobillon et al.
(2012), but also unknown exits, as well as entries into unemployment. More generally, we assess the robustness of the
results when using estimation methods that deal with the
presence of a larger set of unobserved heterogeneity terms
than difference in differences.
A. Data

We use the historical file of job applicants to the National
Agency for Employment (Agence nationale pour l’emploi,
ANPE) for the Paris region. This data set covers the large
majority of unemployment spells in the region given that
registration with the national employment agency is a prerequisite for unemployed workers to claim unemployment
benefits in France. We use a flow sample of unemployment
spells that started between July 1989 and June 2003 and
study exits from unemployment between January 1993 and
June 2003. This period includes the implementation date of
the enterprise zone program (January 1, 1997) and allows us
to study the effect of enterprise zones not only in the short
run but also in the medium run. These unemployment spells
may end when the unemployed find a job, drop out of the
labor force, leave unemployment for an unknown reason, or
when the spell is right-censored.
Regarding the geographic scale of analysis, given that
enterprise zones are clusters of a significant size within or
across municipalities, it would be desirable to try to detect
the effect of the policy at the level of an enterprise zone
and comparable neighboring areas. Nevertheless, our data
do not let us work at such a fine scale of disaggregation,
and we retain municipalities as our spatial units of analysis.
Municipalities have on average twice the population of the
enterprise zone they contain. As a consequence, any effect
at the municipality level measures the effect of local job
creation net of within-municipality transfers.
The Paris metropolitan region on which we focus is
inhabited by 10.9 million people and subdivided into 1,300
municipalities. We use only municipalities that have between
8,000 and 100,000 inhabitants, as every municipality comprising an enterprise zone has a population within this range.
Using propensity score estimation, we select as controls
municipalities whose score is close to the support of the
score for treated municipalities, and this further restricts
our working sample to 148 municipalities (135 controls and
13 treatments). On average, about 300 unemployed workers
find a job each half-year in each of those municipalities. In
view of these figures, we chose half-years as our time intervals, since using shorter periods would generate too much
sampling variability.
Descriptive statistics relative to exits to a job, exits to
unemployment, and exits for unknown reasons can be found
in online appendix C.2.

B. Results

In Table 4, we report estimation results of the enterprise zone treatment effect obtained with the most promising
methods that were evaluated in the Monte Carlo experiments.14 As explained at the end of the previous section, we
use the interactive effect model with a treatment dummy and
the synthetic control approach, and contrast them with the
most popular method of difference in differences. Standard
errors of the “Interactive effect, treatment dummy” estimates
are computed using i.i.d. disturbances, an assumption we
justify below.
We also derive a confidence interval for the synthetic control estimate that, as far as we know, has not been derived
in the literature. We construct this confidence interval by
inverting a test statistic whose distribution is obtained by
using permutations between local units under the (admittedly
strong) assumption of exchangeable disturbances across
local units. The procedure is as follows. Subtract the synthetic control estimate α̂ from posttreatment outcomes of
treated units. Next, draw 10,000 times without replacement
13 units in the whole population (treated and controls) and
consider them as the new treated units, while the other 135
are the new controls. Construct synthetic controls in each
sample, and estimate the average treatment effect. Derive
the estimated quantiles q̂0.025 and q̂0.975 from the empirical
distribution of estimates. Consider now any null hypothesis
H0 : α = α0 and reject it at level 5% when α0 − α̂ does not
belong to the interval bounded by those quantiles. Inverting
this test yields the confidence interval, [α̂+ q̂0.025 , α̂+ q̂0.975 ],
reported in table 4. Note that we use a nonpivotal statistic in
the absence of any result about asymptotic standard errors
of the synthetic control estimates. As a consequence, the
confidence interval has no refined asymptotic properties.
We analyze three outcomes at the level of municipalities
constructed for each six-month period between July 1993
and June 2003: exit from unemployment to a job, exit from
unemployment for unknown reasons, and entry into unemployment. The outcome describing unemployment exits (to
a job or for unknown reasons) is defined as the logarithm of
the ratio between the number of unemployed workers exiting during the period and the number of unemployed at risk
at the beginning of the period. Entries are defined in the
same way. Table 4 reports results using our three estimation
methods for each outcome.
Starting with exits to a job, we find a small positive
and significant treatment effect using the interactive effect
method in line with the “Diff-in-diffs” estimate and with
the findings in Gobillon et al. (2012) in which we used
difference in differences but with a more limited number
of periods.15 The size of the interactive effect estimate is
14 The only slight modification is that for the FGLS first difference estimate, the covariance matrix is kept general enough to allow for serial
correlation of unknown form.
15 This was based on an analysis distinguishing short-run and long-run
effects of the program.

slightly larger than the difference-in-differences estimate and
tends to increase with the number of factors included in the
estimation. In contrast, the “Synthetic control” estimate is
negative, although the estimated confidence interval is so
large that this estimate is not significantly different from 0
at a level of 5%.
In the Monte Carlo experiment, differences between interactive effect estimates and other estimates were interpreted
as an issue of disjoint supports. We plot in figure 1 the
additive local effect (i.e., the factor loading associated to the

constant factor) and the multiplicative factor loading for each
control unit (circle) and each treated unit (triangle) in the
case in which the model includes two individual effects only.
This graph does not exhibit any evidence against the hypothesis that the support of factor loadings for the treated units is
included in the corresponding support for the controls. We
tried to construct a test using permutation techniques (Good,
2005) and failed to reject the null hypothesis of inclusion of
the supports. In the absence of formal analyses of this test
in the literature, we do not know, however, if this result is
due to the low power of such a test.
Another cause of the discrepancy between synthetic controls and interactive effects could be the presence of serial
correlation. When a single local effect is considered as in the
difference-in-differences method, serial correlation is still
substantial, and the estimate of the autocorrelation of order
1 is around .35. In contrast, estimates of the serial correlation in the interactive effect model are close to 0. Factor
models exhaust serial time dependence, and this is also true
for spatial dependence.16 By contrast, we do not know much
about the behavior of synthetic controls when serial correlation and spatial correlation are substantial. Interestingly, the
within estimate without any correction for serial correlation
is also on the negative side and close to the synthetic control
estimate.
Results for other outcomes confirm the diagnostic that
synthetic control estimates seem to have a behavior different from interactive effect estimates and difference-indifferences estimates. While interactive effect estimates of
16 This result is obtained using a Moran test when the distance matrix is
constructed using the reciprocal of the geographical distance. Other contiguity schemes (e.g., when using discrete distance matrices constructed
using 5 km and 10 km thresholds) capture positive spatial correlations,
although they diminish with the number of factors.

550

THE REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS

the treatment effect are undistinguishable from 0 when we
analyze exits from unemployment for unknown reasons,
difference in differences yield a positive but insignificant
estimate and synthetic controls a positive and significant
estimate. As we have reasons to believe that the treatment
effect should be larger for the outcome recording exits to a
job than for the outcome recording exits for unknown reasons, synthetic control estimates seem slightly incoherent.
Nonetheless, it is also true that synthetic control and interactive effect estimates for the effect of treatment on entries
are very similar, while difference-in-differences estimates
seem surprisingly positive and nearly significant.
As a robustness check, we report in the online appendix
C.4 the treatment effect estimates when the propensity score
is introduced as a regressor. Results are very similar with
those presented in the text.

Conclusion

In this paper, we compared different methods of estimation of the effect of a regional policy using time-varying
regional data. Spatial and serial dependence are captured
by a linear factor structure that permits conditioning on
an extended set of unobserved local effects when applying
methods of policy evaluation. We show how difference-indifferences estimates are biased and how interactive effect
methods following Bai (2009) can be applied. We compare different versions of these interactive effect methods
with a synthetic control approach and with a more traditional difference-in-differences approach in Monte Carlo
experiments. We finally apply the different methods to the
evaluation of an entreprise zone program introduced in
France in the late 1990s. In both Monte Carlo experiments
and the empirical application, interactive effect estimates
behave well with respect to competitors.
There are quite a few interesting extensions worth exploring in empirical analyses. First, there is a tension between
two empirical strategies in regional policy evaluations (Blundell et al., 2004). On the one hand, choosing areas in
the neighborhood of treated areas as controls might lead
to biased estimates since neighbors might be affected by
spillovers or contamination effects of the policy. On the other
hand, nonneighbors might be located too far away from the
treated areas to be good matches and therefore good controls. This paper tackles this issue in a somewhat automatic
way by letting factor loadings pick out spatial correlation in
the data. A richer robustness analysis would allow the modification of the populations of controls and treatments by
playing on the distance between municipalities and locally
treated areas as was done in Gobillon et al. (2012).
Second, it is easy to extend the interactive effect procedures we have analyzed to the case in which the treatment
date varies with time. This is particularly easy in the linear
factor model, and this setup is used by Kim and Oka (2014).

In addition, the variability of treatment dates facilitates the
identification of the treatment effect since the rank condition, equation (15), used in section IIIC for identification
purposes, is no longer needed, although endogeneity issues
might become more severe. The synthetic control approach
can also be adapted when the treatment date varies across
treated units by using a variable number of pretreatment
outcomes to construct the synthetic control.
A word of caution is also in order in case of extrapolation.
When supports of exogenous variables and factor loadings of
the treated units are not included in the corresponding supports of the control units, we have seen that unconstrained
interactive effect estimation methods perform better than
matching methods such as a constrained Bai method or synthetic controls. This conclusion is nonetheless due to our
Monte Carlo setting in which the true data-generating process has linear factors. If it was nonlinear, this asymmetry
between methods would disappear, and no method would
be likely to dominate each other. Extrapolation is indeed a
case in which any technique needs some untestable assumptions to achieve identification. Bounds on outcome variations
might, however, lead to partial identification of treatment
effects.

APPENDIX
Proof of Lemma 1
Let Y and X be some real random vectors whose supports denoted SY
and SX are included in RK . Assume that SX is convex and bounded.
Denote D the distance between Y and its projection on the convex hull
generated by n independent copies of X. Namely, let this convex hull be
defined as
⎧
⎫
n
n
⎨
⎬


ŜX,n = Z; Z =
ωj Xj , ωj ≥ 0,
ωj = 1 ,
⎩
⎭
j=1

j=1

so that
D = Y − ProjŜX,n (Y ) .
We use the result that if n → ∞, ŜX,n → SX in probability in the Hausdorf
sense, that is,
dH (ŜX,n , SX ) = oP (1),
in which dH is the Hausdorf distance. The proof of this result is in Dumbgen
and Walther (1996).
Assume that SY ⊂ SX . Consider any realization y of Y and a realization
Ŝx,n of ŜX,n . If y ∈ Ŝx,n , then the realization of D is 0. If y ∈
/ Ŝx,n , then the
realization of D is bounded since SX is bounded. As by the result above
dH (ŜX,n , SX ) = oP (1) and y ∈ SX then
/ ŜX,n ) Pr(Y ∈
/ ŜX,n )
E(D) = E(D | Y ∈ ŜX,n ) Pr(Y ∈ ŜX,n ) + E(D | Y ∈
= E(D | Y ∈
/ ŜX,n ) Pr(Y ∈
/ ŜX,n ) → 0 when n → ∞.
