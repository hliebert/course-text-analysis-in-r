I. Introduction

There is a large literature on semiparametric estimation of average treatment effects
under unconfounded treatment assignment.
Here we discuss lessons from this literature
for the many covariate setting, and propose
some supplementary analyses to assess the
credibility of the analyses. Using the potential outcome or Rubin Causal Model setup
(Imbens and Rubin 2015), each unit is characterized by the potential outcomes ​(​Y​i​​  (0), ​Yi​​​  (1))​  ,
with the interest in the average causal effect:
​τ = E [ ​Yi​​​  (1) − ​Y​i​​  (0) ] ,​or the average effect for the
treated. The treatment assignment is ​​W​i​​  ∈ {0, 1}​.
We observe ​​
W​i​​​and the realized outcome,
​​Yi​  obs
​  ​  = ​Y​i​​  (​Wi​​​  )​and pretreatment variables ​​
X​i​​​.
We assume unconfoundedness (Rosenbaum and
Rubin1983):

​ϕ(y, w, x; τ, μ( ⋅ ,   ⋅ ) , e( ⋅ ))

y − μ(1, x)
y − μ(0, x)
  = w  ​ _________

 ​
​  − (1 − w)​​ ________

e(x)
+ μ(1, x) − μ(0, x) − τ,

(Hahn 1998). A number of estimators for ​τ​ have
been proposed in this setting, relying on different characterizations of ​τ​ :
​  ​  ⋅ (1 − ​W​i​​  )
​Yi​  obs
​Y​  obs
​  ​  ⋅ ​W​i​​ ____________

​  ​  − μ(1, ​X​i​​  )

​   
− 1(1 − ​Wi​​​)____________
 ​
1 − e( ​Xi​​​  )

and overlap of the covariate distributions, e​
(x ) ∈ (0, 1),​where the propensity
score (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983) is ​
e(x)
= Pr( ​Wi​​​  = 1| ​Xi​​​  = x)​
. Define p​= E [ ​Wi​​​  ]​  ,​
μ(w, x ) = E [ ​Yi​​​  (w ) | ​Xi​​​  = x]​  , ​​μ​w​​  = E [ ​Yi​​​  (w)]​  ,

]

+ μ(1, ​Xi​​​  )  − μ(0, ​X​i​​  ) ​.​

Because unconfoundedness imposes no restrictions on the joint distribution of the observed
variables, it follows by Newey (1994) that all
three approaches, substituting suitable nonparametric estimators of e​ ( ⋅ )​and μ
​ ( ⋅ ,   ⋅ )​ , reach the
semiparametric efficiency bound.

II. Four Issues

A. Double Robustness

278

A finding from the literature is that the best
estimators in practice involve both estimation of ​μ(w, x)​and ​e(x)​ , making them “doubly
robust” (Robins and Rotnitzky 1995). One such

VOL. 107 NO. 5

Average Treatment Effects

­estimator for ​τ​ sets the average of the efficient
score equal to zero as a function of ​τ​ given estimators ​​μˆ ​( ⋅ ,   ⋅ )​ and ​​eˆ ​( ⋅ )​. As long as either the
­estimator for either μ
​ (w, x)​or e​ (x)​is consistent,
the resulting estimator for τ​ ​is consistent.
B. Modifying the Estimand

279

we can characterize the bias as E
​ [​ b( ​Xi​​​  )]​​  , proportional to the covariance of the propensity
score and the conditional expectations of the
potential outcomes. Settings where ​b( · )​is very
variable, are particularly challenging for estimating ​τ​.
III. Three Estimators

A practical concern is that the average treatment effect may be difficult to estimate precisely
if the propensity score is close to zero for a substantial fraction of the population. Then one may
wish to focus on a weighted average effect of the
treatment
​​τ​ω(·)​​  = E​[ω( ​Xi​​​  )​(​Y​i​​  (1)  − ​Y​i​​  (0))​]​/ E​[ω( ​Xi​​​  )]​,​

for ​
ω( · )​that de-emphasize extreme values
of the propensity score. The semiparametric
efficiency bound for ​​τ​ω(·)​​​ can be substantially
smaller than the asymptotic variance bound for​
τ​itself (Crump et al. 2009).
C. Weighting versus Balancing
Recently there have been a number of estimators proposed that focus directly on balancing
the pretreatment variables (Hainmueller 2012;
Zubizarreta 2015; Graham, Campos de Xavier
Pinto, and Egel 2012). Specifically, given a set of
pretreatment variables X​
​​ i​​​ , one can look for a set of
weights ​​λi​​​​such that the weighted average covariates are the same in the two treatment groups,
which eliminates any biases associated with linear and additive effects in the pretreatment variables whereas using the propensity score weights
does so only in expectation.
D. Sensitivity
The bias in the simple difference in average
outcomes by treatment status as an estimator
for the average treatment effect arises from the
presence of pretreatment variables that are associated with both the treatment and the potential
outcomes. As a result, it is the sparsity of the
product of the respective coefficients that matter.
Defining
​b(x ) = ​( p(1 − p ))​​  −1​  (e(x) − p)​
 ​
× ( p(μ(0, x) − ​μ​0​​) + (1 − p)(μ(1, x) − ​μ​1​​  )),​

Here we briefly discuss three of the most
promising estimators that have been proposed
for the case with many pretreatment variables.
Belloni et al. (2013) propose the double selection estimator (DSE) using LASSO (Tibshirani
1996) as a covariate selection method. They first
select pretreatment variables that are important
for explaining the outcome, then select pretreatment variables that are important for explaining
the treatment assignment and combine the two
sets of pretreatment variables.
Athey, Imbens, and Wager (2016) propose
the approximate residual balancing estimator
(ARBE) using elastic net or LASSO to estimate
the conditional outcome expectation, and then
using an approximate balancing approach in the
spirit of Zubizarreta (2015) to further remove
bias arising from remaining imbalances in the
pretreatment variables.
In the general discussion of semiparametric estimation van der Vaart (2000) suggest
estimating the finite dimensional component
as the average of the influence function, with
the infinite dimensional components estimated
nonparametrically, leading to a doubly robust
estimator (DRE) in the spirit of Robins and
Rotnitzky (1995). In the specific context of
estimation of average treatment effects van der
Laan and Rubin (2006) propose a closely related
estimator as a special case of the targeted maximum likelihood approach. Chernozhukov et al.
(2016), in the context of much more general
estimation problems, propose a closely related
double machine learning estimator (DMLE)
that also incorporates sample splitting to further
improve the properties.

standard errors. Supporting analyses (Athey and
Imbens 2016) should be presented to convey to
the reader that the estimates effectively adjust
for differences in the covariates. Here are four
specific recommendations to do so.
Robustness.—Do not rely on a single estimation method. If the substantive results are not
robust to the specific choice of estimator relying on the same identification assumptions, it is
unlikely that the results are credible.
Overlap.—Compare the variance bound for ​τ​
and ​​τω(·)
​ ​​​for a choice of ω
​ ( · )​that de-emphasizes
parts of the covariate space with limited overlap. If there is a substantial efficiency difference
between the ​τ​ and ​​τ​ω(⋅)​​​ , report results for both.
Specification Sensitivity.—Split the sample
based on median values of each of the covariates in turn, estimate the parameter of interest
on both subsamples and average the estimates
to assess sensitivity to the model specification
(e.g., Athey and Imbens 2015).
Scaled Bootstrap Bias.—Report estimates of
the bias of the estimator, based on repeatedly
half-sampling
B. An Illustration
We illustrate these recommendations with
the Connors et al. (1996) heart catherization
data, with 72 covariates, with additional illustrations in the working paper version (Athey
et al. 2017). We report the simple difference in

average outcomes by treatment status, the OLS
estimator with all covariates, and the estimators DSE, ARBE, DRE, and DMLE. In addition
we report simple bootstrap standard errors, the
scaled bootstrap bias (SBB, based on half-sampling, scaled by the bootstrap standard error),
the average of the estimator based on sample
splits, one for each covariate, where we split the
sample by the median value of each covariate
in turn and then average the estimates (Athey
and Imbens 2015), and summary statistics of
​​bˆ ​( ​Xi​​​  )​.
The four main estimators range from 0.037
to 0.062. This range is substantial compared
to the difference relative to the naïve estimator of 0.074, and relative to the standard error.
Trimming does not reduce this range substantially. The scaled bootstrap bias is as large as
29 percent of the standard error, so coverage of
confidence intervals may not be close to nominal. Splitting systematically on all covariates
generates substantial variation in the estimates.
The tentative conclusion is that under unconfoundedness the average effect is likely to be
positive, but with a range substantially wider
than suggested by the standard errors for any of
the estimators.
C. Challenges
Choice of Regularization.—The regularization methods are based on optimal prediction
rather than focusing on the ultimate object of
interest, the average treatment effect, and do not
take account of the fact that not all errors in estimating the unknown functions matter equally.

Average Treatment Effects

Choice of Prediction Methods.—The leading estimators allow for different prediction
methods of the unknown functions, without
­
guidance for practitioners on how to make this
choice in practice.
Supporting Analyses.—There is more work
needed on supporting analyses that are intended
to provide evidence so that in a particular data
analysis the answer is credible.
