1. Introduction

Recent work by Burguete, Gallant and Souza (1982) and Hansen
(19X2) has provided a unified framework for obtaining
the asymptotic
properties of econometric
estimators. For the purpose of obtaining
the
asymptotic covariance matrix of an econometric estimator, most estimators can be viewed as members of a class of method of moments
estimators. An estimator in this class is obtained by choosing a parameter
value such that sample moments of certain functions of the data and
parameters are close to the population
moment of these functions. which
is zero. The purpose of this note is to show that sequential estimators can
be viewed as members of this class of estimators,
and that this view
facilitates calculation of a consistent estimator of the asymptotic covariante matrix of a sequential estimator.
In the next section we briefly discuss a class of method of moments
estimators and review a method of forming a consistent estimator of the

Define the 4 dimensional

Sequential estimators can be viewed as being obtained from solving a
set of equations of the form given eq. (2) where the functions f( X, ,B)
have a recursive structure, as functions of p. For simplicity, we will treat
only the case of two-step estimators, leaving multiple step estimators as
an obvious generalization.

vector ,k? as /I =
(Q’, A’)‘, where B is I x 1, A is m x 1. and I + m = q. Also, partition

The vector of estimates (6. fi) is sequential, since 6 can be obtained in a
first step from eq. (5). and A in a second step by substituting
4 for 8 and
solving eq. (6).
The virtue of viewing two-step estimators as solving eqs. (5) and (6)
simultaneously
is that asymptotic
results for the class method of moments estimators we have discussed apply. Once the appropriate

for a two-step estimator
have been
obtained, a consistent estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix can
be obtained as in eq. (4). We will give an example of a two-step estimator

involved to obtain the asymptotic covariance matrix for
multiple step estimators
can be found in McFadden
(1981), where the asymptoric

where (u,. V,) has mean zero conditional

serially uncorrelated
and homoscedastic,
B is a IX 1 vector and X a m X 1
vector of parameters, Z, is a 1 X I vector of random variables, and W, is a
1 x k vector of random variables. The variable Z,O, is supposed to be the
expectation of y,, given information
at time t, and O,,enters the regression
function for yz, through Z,& and past values of this variable.
An estimator of 0, and X,, can be obtained by regressing y,, on Z, to
obtain 4, substituting
4 for O,,in the regression function m( W,, A. 8), and
running a non-linear
regression of A, on m(W,. A. 6) to obtain fi. Let
X, = (Z,, W,), and define
u,(8)=_~,,

y(O, X) =yz, m( 4. h, 0). Then we can let

The moment eq. (5) for the first step estimator 6 then becomes the
normal equations for least squares and eq. (6) is the first-order conditions
for the non-linear
least squares estimator A. with 8 substituted
for 8.
