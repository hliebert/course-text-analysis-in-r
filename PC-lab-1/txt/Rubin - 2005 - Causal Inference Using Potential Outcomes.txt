Inference Using Potential Outcomes:
Design, Modeling, Decisions

Causal

effects are defined as comparisons of potential outcomes under different treatments on a common set of units. Observed values of the
probabilistic model for the treatment each unit receives as a function of
potential outcomes are revealed by the assignment mechanism?a
covariates and potential outcomes. Fisher made tremendous contributions to causal inference through his work on the design of randomized

experiments, but the potential outcomes perspective applies to other complex experiments and nonrandomized studies as well. As noted
by Kempthorne in his 1976 discussion of Savage's Fisher lecture, Fisher never bridged his work on experimental design and his work
on parametric modeling, a bridge that appears nearly automatic with an appropriate view of the potential outcomes framework, where
the potential outcomes and covariates are given a Bayesian distribution to complete themodel specification. Also, this framework crisply
separates scientific inference for causal effects and decisions based on such inference, a distinction evident in Fisher's discussion of tests

of significance versus tests in an accept/reject framework. But Fisher never used the potential outcomes framework, originally proposed by
Neyman in the context of randomized experiments, and as a result he provided generally flawed advice concerning the use of the analysis
of covariance to adjust for posttreatment concomitants in randomized trials.

On one occasion, Fisher (1954) struck out blindly against a young lady who
had been anything but offensive or incompetent. His conclusion was that had
the lady known what she was about she would have solved a certain problem in
a certain fashion; he was right about that but failed to notice that she had solved
it in just that fashion.

But at the time Fisher "discovered" or "invented" physical
randomization, he did not use notation likeNeyman's and could
not have been aware of his thesis,which was written inPolish.
On the other hand, Fisher certainly seemed to have the idea of
potential outcomes lurking inhis consciousness before 1923; as
he wrote (Fisher 1918, p. 214):
If we say, "This boy has grown tall because he has been well fed," we are
not merely tracing out the cause and effect in an individual instance; we are
suggesting that he might quite probably have been worse fed, and that in this
case he would have been shorter.

Clearly, Fisher is contemplating an alternative hypothesis and
the associated potential outcome under that hypothesis. But
having the idea is very different from both having it and for
mulating explicit mathematical notation for it.As far as I can
tell, Fisher never used the potential outcome notation despite

Fisher made tremendous contributions to likelihood theory
itself (starting, essentially, with Fisher 1922) and to specific
models forf(-\0). But Fisher never related his vast work on
likelihoods and models to his vast work on experimental de

In agricultural experiments involving the yield following different kinds of

effect of the treatments being investigated [inwhich case plant number is a true
