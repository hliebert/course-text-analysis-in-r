Partially Identifying Treatment
Effects with an Application to

Covering the Uninsured
Brent Kreider
Steven C. Hill
ABSTRACT

We extend the nonparametric literature on partially identified probabilit
distributions and use our analytical results to provide sharp bounds on t
impact of universal health insurance on provider visits and medical
expenditures. Our approach accounts for uncertainty about the reliabilit
of self-reported insurance status as well as uncertainty created by
unknown counter)actuals. We construct health insurance validation dat
using detailed information from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.
Imposing relatively weak nonparametric assumptions, we estimate that
under universal coverage monthly per capita provider visits and expenditu
would rise by less than 8 percent and 16 percent, respectively, across th
nonelderly population.

410 The Journal of Human Resources

I. Introduction
Numerous academic studies have investigated relationships between
health insurance status and a wide variety of outcomes such as healthcare utilization,
health status, labor supply, and participation in public assistance programs. In more

than 70 articles surveyed by Gruber and Madrian (2004), Levy and Meitzer (2004),
and Buchmueller et al (2005), nearly all parameters of interest are identified using
parametric approaches.1
We develop the first nonparametric framework for studying the potential impact of
universal health insurance on the nation's use of medical services. Within this frame
work, we study relationships between insurance status and use of services (expendi
tures and number of provider visits) in an environment of uncertainty about both
counterfactual utilization outcomes and status quo insurance status. Uncertainty
about counterfactuals arises because insurance status is not randomly assigned.
For example, families that expect to use more health services have more incentive
to acquire health insurance. More generally, insurance status depends on individual
and family characteristics that may also influence healthcare use. Utilization patterns
among households who become insured though expanded programs would not nec
essarily resemble observed utilization patterns among households that had already
self-selected into insured status on their own.
Beyond the uncertainty created by unknown counterfactuals, validation studies
have recently called into question the reliability of households' responses to ques
tions about their current insurance status. Significant misreporting has been docu
mented in several popular surveys including the Current Population Survey (CPS),
the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), the Behavioral Risk Factor

Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey, the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey
(MEPS), and others (Davern et al 2007; Card, Hildreth, and Shore-Sheppard

2004; Hill 2007/2008; Nelson et al 2000). Estimated error rates, which vary across
surveys, have been linked in part to difficulties in recalling past coverage and diffi
culties reporting the status of other family members (Nelson et al 2000; Pascale
2007). The Census Bureau now issues caveats about the accuracy of insurance esti
mates from the CPS (DeNaves-Walt, Proctor, and Hill Lee 2005).
Using matched surveys of employers and their employees, Berger, Black, and
Scott (1998) find that 21 percent of the workers and their employers disagree about
whether the worker was eligible for insurance. Their study appears to represent the
only prior analysis of potentially mismeasured insurance status in an econometric
framework. Assuming exogenous measurement error in a classical errors-in-variables
setting (after accounting for the binary nature of the mismeasured variable), they find

that even nonsystematic reporting error seriously biases their estimated effect of
insurance eligibility on wage growth.
The presence of reporting errors compromises a researcher's ability to make reli
able inferences about the status quo, and it further confounds identification of
1. As an exception, Olson (1998) uses semiparametric techniques to estimate the relationship between
women's labor hours and the availability of health insurance through a spouse. More recently, Gerfin
and Schellhorn (2006) use nonparametric techniques and Swiss data to bound the effects of deductibles
on the probability of visiting a physician.

counterfactual outcomes associated with policies that would alter the distribution of
insurance coverage within the population, such as national health insurance.2 Consis
tent with such concerns, some advocates have argued that uncertainty about the num

bers and characteristics of the uninsured constitutes an important barrier to
identifying optimal policy solutions (for example, Hunter 2004; Woolhandler and
Himmelstein 2007). Highlighting surprising degrees of insurance classification error
in many popular national surveys, along with dramatic inconsistencies in responses
when experimental followup insurance questions have been posed, Czajka and Lewis
(1999) write: "Until we can make progress in separating the measurement error from
the reality of uninsurance, our policy solutions will continue to be inefficient, and our
ability to measure our successes will continue to be limited."
Our analysis extends the nonparametric literature on partially identified probabil
ity distributions in several dimensions. First, we provide sharp bounds on the condi
tional mean of a random variable (in our case healthcare visits or expenditures) for
the case that a binary conditioning variable (insurance status) is subject to arbitrary
endogenous classification error. In this environment, insurance reporting errors are
allowed to be arbitrarily related to true insurance status and healthcare use. These
results extend parts of the analyses of Horowitz and Manski (1998) and Kreider
and Pepper (2007). Second, we formally assess how statistical identification of a
treatment effect decays with the degree of uncertainty about the status quo. Our ap
proach extends the nonparametric treatment effect literature for the case that some
treatments are unobserved (especially Molinari, Forthcoming).3 Third, we relax the
nondifferential errors independence assumption evaluated, for example, by Bollinger
(1996) and Bound, Brown, and Mathiowetz (2001) embedded in the classical errors
in-variables model. As an alternative, we evaluate the identifying power of a weaker
"nonincreasing errors" monotonicity assumption that presumes that misreporting of
insurance status does not rise with the level of utilization. This assumption allows for
the possibility, for example, that using health services informs a patient of her true

insurance status.4

We exploit detailed data in the 1996 MEPS to construct health insurance valida
tion data for a nonrandom portion of the sample based on insurance cards, policy
booklets, and followback interviews with employers and insurance companies. The
next section describes these data and our health insurance verification strategy. Sec
tion III formalizes the identification problem associated with estimating a particular
descriptive statistic, the gap in health service use between the status quo insured and
uninsured under existing policies, when insurance status is subject to arbitrary

2. The extent to which universal coverage would increase use of services and expenditures has been esti
mated in a variety of parametric studies (Institute of Medicine 2003; Blumberg et al. 2006). Estimates of
incremental spending range from $34 to $69 billion per year depending on the statistical assumptions and
choice of comparison groups.
3. To isolate identification problems associated with partially unobserved insurance status as a conditioning
variable or treatment, we assume that other variables in the analysis are measured without error.

4. Using methods in Lewbel (2007), the treatment effects could be point-identified in certain cases if we
had instruments that affect insurance status but not classification error or the average treatment effect. For

related work on potentially endogenous classification errors in a linear regression framework, see Frazis and
Loewenstein (2003). Given the difficulty in identifying plausible instruments in our application, we con
sider what can be identified in the absence of instruments.

patterns of classification error. We derive bounds on the unknown utilization gap un
der alternative assumptions about the nature and degree of reporting errors. Extend
ing these results, Section IV investigates what can be learned about the impact of
national health insurance on the use of health services. Combining our "nonincreas
ing errors" assumption with common monotonicity assumptions in the treatment
effects literature, such as monotone treatment response (related to moral hazard)

and monotone treatment selection (related to adverse selection), we can provide rea
sonably tight bounds on the impact of universal coverage without relying on some of
the more controversial assumptions involving functional forms and independence.
Our primary set of estimates focuses on policies that would extend coverage to the
uninsured using the same mixture of private and public insurance that exists under
the status quo. Another set of estimates focuses on policies that would extend exist
ing public programs to cover the uninsured. Both types of expansions have been
implemented by states. Hawaii, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Washington created pub
lic programs open to all uninsured children but with premiums for higher income
families (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured 2007). Maine, Massa
chusetts, and Vermont expanded public programs and developed new programs with
subsidized premiums and other features (Kaye and Snyder 2007). Massachusetts also
mandates that individuals purchase insurance, facilitated with subsidies for low
income adults and fees for employers that do not provide coverage (Holahan and
Blumberg 2006). California and other states are considering proposals with features
similar to those of Massachusetts, and prominent presidential candidates also advo
cate covering the uninsured with a mixture of private and public insurance. Section V
compares our nonparametric estimates with those from parametric studies, and Sec
tion VI concludes.

II. The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey
The data come from the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey
(MEPS), a nationally representative household survey conducted by the U.S. Agency
for Health care Research and Quality. In the MEPS Household Component (MEPS
HC), each family (reporting unit) was interviewed five times over two and a half
years to obtain annual data reflecting a two-year reference period (Cohen 1997). This
paper focuses on the nonelderly population because almost all adults become eligible
for Medicare at age 65. The sample contains 18,851 individuals.
We study insurance and service use in July 1996. We focus on July because the
1996 MEPS has a followback survey of employers, unions, and insurance companies
which reported insurance information as of July 1, 1996. We use 1996 data because
that is the only year for which respondents to the followback survey reported on the
employees' and policy holders' insurance status rather than whether the establish
ment offered insurance.5 Studying insurance and service use in one month also

reduces the likelihood of confounding the dynamics of insurance status with

misreported insurance status because employment-related insurance typically covers
an entire month.

A. Insurance Status Reported in the Household Component
The MEPS HC asks about insurance from a comprehensive list of all possible sour
ces of insurance. In the first interview, conducted between March and August 1996,
MEPS HC asked the family respondent about insurance held at any time since Jan
uary 1st. Because employment-related insurance is the most prevalent source of in
surance, the family respondent was asked about all jobs held by coresiding family
members since January 1st, jobs family members had retired from, and the last
job held. The family respondent was asked whether the employee had insurance from

each job. Then the family respondent was asked whether anyone had:

Medicare
Medicaid
Champus/Champva
For those who did not report Medicaid, any other type of health insurance
through any state or local government agency which provided hospital and phy
sician benefits
Health benefits from other state programs or other public programs providing
coverage for healthcare services6

Other sources of private insurance, such as from a group or association, insur
ance company, previous employer, or union.
For each source of insurance, MEPS HC asked which family members were covered

and when.7

In the second interview, conducted between August and December 1996, MEPS
HC asked questions based on jobs and insurance reported to be held at the time of
the first interview to determine whether previously reported insurance was still held
or when it ended. MEPS also asked about new jobs and insurance from those jobs,
public insurance acquired since the first interview, and insurance acquired from other
sources since the first interview. The recall period is not especially long, typically
four to seven months. Responses to the questions from the first and second interview
were used to construct indicators of insurance coverage at any time during July 1996
and uninsurance, the residual category. Family respondents reported 80.7 percent of
the nonelderly population was insured in July 1996 and 19.3 percent were uninsured

(Table 1).

6. A very small number of individuals are reportedly covered through Aid to Families with Dependent
Children (AFDC) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and these are counted as Medicaid. Other sour
ces, such as the Veterans Administration and the Indian Health Services, are not included in measures of
hospital/physician insurance.
7. State-specific program names are used in the questions. Insurance status is not imputed to families with
missing data, which are rare.

B. Service Use and Expenditures
In each interview, the MEPS asks about healthcare services used by all coresiding
family members since the last interview. The MEPS also obtains permission to inter
view a sample of the medical providers identified in the Household Component sur

veys to supplement household-reported healthcare expenditure and source of
payment information. We create measures of service use and expenditures in July
1996: number of provider visits for ambulatory medical care (a medical provider
visit, hospital outpatient visit, or emergency room visit), an indicator for whether
the sample person had a hospital stay or ambulatory services, and expenditures for
hospital stays and ambulatory services. Twenty-one percent of the (weighted) sample
used medical care in that month.8 Persons who the family respondent said were in
sured in July were nearly 80 percent more likely to have used medical care (22.5 per
cent of the insured versus 12.7 percent of the uninsured, Table 1). The mean number
of provider visits is also much greater for the reportedly insured, as are mean expen
ditures.

C. Verification Data
We use detailed data to identify sample members for whom there is evidence cor
roborating their insurance status. The 1996 MEPS includes three sources that can be
used to confirm health insurance reported by families: (1) the HC interviewers ask
respondents to show insurance cards, (2) the HC interviewers ask respondents to pro
vide policy booklets, and (3) separate interviews were conducted with family mem
bers' employers and insurance companies. Respondents for the family, employers, or
insurance companies could err in reporting a person's insurance status; none provides
a gold standard of information. Nonetheless, we use confirmations of insurance status
to formally verify the insurance status of some sample members. This approach rep
resents a compromise between taking reported insurance status at face value for all
sample members and discarding valuable family respondents' reports about insur
ance status.
We label sample members as verified insured if an insurance card was shown at the
time of the interview, a policy booklet was given to the interviewer, or if an employer

or insurance company confirmed that the person was covered by insurance. We as
sume that a report that a sample member is uninsured is accurate as long as there
is no contradictory information from any family member's employers and all
employers provided data. The person's insurance status was not verified (but not as
sumed to be incorrect) if there were insufficient verification data or if employers or
insurance companies contradicted the family respondent. See Hill (2007/2008) for

details.

As shown in Table 1, we find that 80.2 percent of the reportedly insured were con
firmed as insured by a card, policy booklet, or an establishment. For the few cases in
which a respondent produced an insurance card but the establishment reported that
the person was uninsured, we treat these cases as verified insured based on the phys
ical evidence of insurance. Among the reportedly uninsured, 11.7 percent are verified
8. In the MEPS, outpatient prescription medications, medical supplies, and durable medical equipment are
not linked to specific months; these expenditures are excluded.

(Table 1). This relatively low number reflects the lack of an employed family mem
ber in some uninsured families and the lack of response by some employers. Recall
that uninsurance is verified under this strategy only if all of the family's employers
responded and confirmed that they did not provide insurance to the sample member.
Overall, 67 percent of the sample was verified.

III. Identifying Utilization Differences Between the

Insured and Uninsured

We now study what can be learned about differences in healthcare
utilization between the insured and uninsured when we cannot perfectly distinguish
between the truly insured and uninsured. In Section IV, we extend the analysis be
yond descriptive statistics to assess what can be learned about the potential impacts
of universal coverage. We ignore heterogeneity of insurance plans and treat coverage
as a binary event. Let 7=1 indicate that a person is truly insured, with I* = 0 other
wise. Instead of observing /*, we observe the self-reported counterpart I. A latent var
iable Z* indicates whether a report is accurate. If I and I* coincide, then Z* = 1;
otherwise, Z ? 0. Let Y = 1 indicate that / is verified to be accurate (that is, Z*
is known to equal 1). If Y = 0, then Z* may be either 1 or 0.9 In no case is the value
of Z* assumed to be 0.10
Let U denote the amount of healthcare services consumed during the reference pe
riod. Typically, the amount of care is measured as health expenditures or number of
provider visits. Policymakers are also interested in the proportion of the population
that uses any medical care, in which case U can be treated as a binary variable. In this
section, we investigate what can be learned about the status quo utilization gap be
tween the insured and uninsured,

(l) a = E(u\r = \)-E{u\r = o),
when true insurance status, /*, is unobserved for part of the sample.11
The utilization gap a is not identified since we observe E(U\I) but not E(U\I*).
Our objective is to provide worst-case bounds on a. To partially identify E(U\I*),
we will first derive bounds on the fraction of the population that consumes no more
than a particular amount of care t conditional on unobserved insurance status,

P([/<f|/*). We can then provide bounds on E(U\I*) by integrating over these
worst-case probabilities.

We begin by writing

9. In their analysis of testing for environmental pollutants, Dominitz and Sherman (2004) were the first to

formalize the idea of distinguishing between "verified" and "unverified" observations in the data.
10. That is, we conservatively allow for the possibility that the MEPS insurance classification is accurate
even if the classification is not formally verified.
11. Our notation leaves implicit any other covariates of interest. We focus on bounding the utilization gap
for the nonelderly population as a whole, but it is straightforward to condition on subpopulations of interest.
Note that we are not estimating a regression, and there are no regression orthogonality conditions to be sat
isfied.

<2) ^sir-)=%*':V"
Neither the numerator nor the denominator is identified, but assumptions on the pat
tern of classification errors can place restrictions on relationships between the unob

served quantities. Let 6,+=P([/</,/ = 1,Z* = 0) and Q;=P(U<t,I = 0,Z* = 0)

denote the fraction of false positive and false negative insurance classifications,

respectively, for those whose medical consumption did not exceed t. Let
e;+=P(U > t, I = 1, Z* = 0) and e; ~ =P(U > f, I = 0, Z* = O) denote the analogous
fractions for those whose use of care exceeded t. We can then decompose the numer
ator and denominator in Equation 2 into identified and unidentified quantities:

(3) p(u < t\r = i)

p(u < *,/= l) + e~-ef+
>(/=i)+ (ef- + e;-)-(er+ + e; + )

where P(U ^ f,/ ? 1) and P(I =1) are identified by the data. In the numerator,
6~? 6J" reflects the unobserved excess of false negative versus false positive insur
ance classifications among those whose use of services did not exceed t. In the de

nominator, (0~ + 6r'~) ?(6* + 6,'+) reflects the unobserved excess of false negative

versus false positive insurance classifications within the entire population. Utilization

among the uninsured, P(U ^ t\I* = 0), can be decomposed in a similar fashion.
We now assess what can be learned about A. First, we present "arbitrary errors"
bounds that impose no structure on the distribution of false positives and false neg
atives. This environment that allows for arbitrary error patterns is termed "corrupt
sampling" (Horowitz and Manski 1995). We then consider the identifying power
of assumptions that restrict the patterns of errors. Results in this section also inform
our treatment effect bounds in Section IV.

A. Arbitrary error bounds
Our analytic framework allows us to trace out bounds on our unknown parameters of
interest as function of a researcher's confidence in reported insurance status. Follow
ing Horowitz and Manski (1995), we consider a lower bound, v, on the accuracy rate
among unverified cases. Setting v = 1 corresponds to an assumption that reported in

surance status is always accurate, the implicit assumption in previous analyses. Set
ting v = 0 corresponds to an assumption that nothing is known about the accuracy of
unverified reports. We will evaluate patterns of identification decay for our parame
ters of interest as v departs froml.
Since we do not observe true insurance status for unverified responses, the accu

racy of such responses cannot logically be known. Nevertheless, our empirical anal

ysis considers four candidates for v: 0.50, 0.84, 0.92, and 1. For the most
conservative value, v = 0.50, the researcher need only make the common classifica
tion error assumption that accurate responses are more prevalent than reporting errors

(see, for example, Bollinger 1996; Frazis and Loewenstein 2003).
The other candidate thresholds, v = 0.84 and v = 0.92, are derived from studies
that have investigated the reliability of self-reported insurance status in the MEPS
and other surveys. Among the reportedly insured (/ = 1), let R ? 1 and M ? 1

denote reported private and public coverage, respectively, and let r* and M* denote
true coverage. If both private and public coverage are reported in the month, which is
rare, private coverage is assumed to take precedence; in such cases, we label reported
coverage as r ? 1 and M = 0 (and analogously for true coverage). Suppressing the
conditioning on Y = 0, the probability of misclassification is given by

p(z* = o) = p{r = o\r = \)p(r = l) + p(r = o|m = \)p{m = i)
+ P(P* = 1|7 = 0)P(7 = 0) + P(M* = 1|7 = 0)P(7 = 0).
For the first term, we conservatively allow the proportion that is truly uninsured
among those reporting private coverage, P(7* = 0\r = 1), to be as high as the pro
portion simply lacking private coverage, P(P* = 0|7? =1). Similarly, we allow the

true rate of being uninsured among those reporting public coverage,

P(7* = 0\M =1), to be as high as the rate of simply lacking public coverage,
P(M* = 0|M = 1). Imposing these inequalities, we can write

P(Z* = 1) > v = 1-P(P* = 0\r = l)p(r = 1)-P(M* - 0\M = 1)P(M = 1)
-p(r* = 1|/ = 0)P(7 = 0)-P(M* = 1|7 = 0)P(7 = 0).
The observed probabilities among the unverified cases are p(r = 1) = 0.35,
p[M = 1) = 0.13, and P(7 = 0) =0.51. Estimates of the unobserved contradiction
rates are inferred from other studies. Hill (2007/2008) estimates that the probability
of truly lacking private insurance when it was reported, p(r* ? 0|P = 1), is about
0.02, with the possibility that it could be as large as 0.12. Our two estimated thresh
olds, v = 0.84 and v = 0.92, incorporate the larger and smaller values, respectively.
The probability of truly having private insurance when no insurance was reported,
P(P* = 1|7 = 0), is estimated to be no higher than 0.10.
For both values of v, we assume that the rate of false positives among those report

ing public coverage, P(M* = 0|M = 1), does not exceed 0.03. Card, Hildreth, and
Shore-Sheppard (2004) estimate that the rate of false positives for Medicaid in the SIPP
ranges from 0.01 to 0.03. Like the MEPS, the SIPP is a longitudinal, household survey.

The MEPS and the SIPP also have similar recall periods and yield fairly similar esti
mates of enrollment in Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program
(SCHIP) (Peterson and Grady 2005). Estimates of P(M* = 1|7 = 0) range from 0.02
(for v = 0.92) to 0.12 (for v = 0.84). These values are derived from benchmarking

studies of the MEPS (Banthin and Sing 2006; Nelson 2003; Peterson and Grady
2005), with the lower value reflecting an estimate that most (83 percent) of those
who failed to report their public insurance instead reported private insurance (Call
et al 2007). Further motivation is provided in an appendix available from the authors.
While we have attempted to be conservative in our derivations of v, these deriva
tions necessarily involve extrapolating information from respondents for whom val
idation data are available. Misreporting rates in our sample of unverified respondents
may not reflect estimated misreporting rates in other samples. While the descriptive
utilization gap results presented later in this section are sensitive to values of v, our
main conclusions in Section IV about the impact of universal health insurance on uti
lization (which impose additional monotonicity assumptions) are fairly robust to the
choice of v across a wide range of values.

In Proposition 1, we formalize what can be known about the utilization gap be
tween the truly insured and truly uninsured given only a lower bound, v, on the frac

tion of accurate insurance classifications among unverified cases:

Proposition 1: Let P(Z* = 1 \Y = 0)^v, and suppose that nothing is known about
the pattern of reporting errors. Then the mean utilization rate among the truly in
sured is bounded sharply as follows:

j UdFH < E{U\F = 1) < J UdFL
using the distribution functions

P(U < f,/= 1) - OL+
P(I = l)-at+ + min{<|)(v)-af+ ,P(U>tJ = 0,Y = 0)}

P(U < t.I = 1) + a~
P(I = 1) + af--min{c|)(v)-a-,P(C/>r,/= 1,F = 0)}
and values

\ min{<|>(v),P(C/ < t,I = 1,F = 0)} if 8f < 0
max{0,min{P(L/ < t,l = 1, F = 0), 4>(v) ?

p(c/ > *, / = 0, 7 = 0)}} otherwise
f min{<|>(v),P(?/ < f,/ = 0, Y = 0)}
max{0,min{P(c/ < *,/ = 0, Y = 0), <|>(v)

P(tf>f,/=l,r = 0)}}

if 8? > 0
otherwise,

where <|)(v) = (1?v)P(7 = 0). Analogous bounds for the utilization rate among the
uninsured, E(U\I* ? 0), are obtained by replacing 1=1 with 1 = 0 and vice versa.

Proof. See Appendix 1.
Notice that increasing v narrows the bounds over some ranges of v but not others, and
the rate of identification decay can be highly nonlinear as v declines. When v = 0,

these bounds can be derived from Horowitz and Manski's (1998) censored regressor
bounds (their Section 4.1). In that context, some observations of a conditioning vari
able are missing in the data. Kreider and Pepper's (2007) Proposition 2 bounds apply
when v = 0 and the outcome U is binary.12
12. Kreider and Pepper (2007) study how labor force participation varies with disability status given a lack
of knowledge of any particular respondent's true disability status. Our Proposition 1 extends their Propo
sition 2 by considering continuous outcomes and by assessing identification for values of v greater than 0
within unverified classifications. Their proposition, however, is more general in the dimension that they do
not impose our identifying assumption that all verified cases are accurate; they allow for the possibility of
errors within verified cases.

420 The Journal of Human Resources
We next bound the difference in use between the insured and uninsured. We could
compute a valid lower (upper) bound on the utilization gap, A, by subtracting the Prop

osition 1 upper (lower) bound on E{U\P = 0) from the Proposition 1 lower (upper)
bound on E(U\I* ? 1). While these bounds on A would be valid, they would not nec
essarily be as tight as possible. In particular, they would not impose the constraints that

the parameters a+ (a~) in the Proposition 1 bounds on E(U\I* = 1) are identical to the

parameters a~ (a+) in the bounds on E(U\I* ? 0). Therefore, we compute sharp
bounds on A using numerical methods that impose these constraints.13

B. Arbitrary error results
Table 2 presents estimated bounds on the utilization gap, A, for any use of services,
number of provider visits, and expenditures. The arbitrary error bounds are provided
in Column 1. When v = 1, A is point-identified as the self-reported gap obtained
from taking the data at face value. For example, the gap in the proportion of insured
and uninsured that used services in July 1996 is point-identified as P(U = l\I =
1) ?P(U = l\I = 0) = 0.098. The gaps in the number of provider visits and expen
ditures are point identified as 0.186 and $77, respectively. Ninety-five percent confi
dence intervals for the gap in any use, number of visits, and expenditures are

calculated as [0.083, 0.112], [0.136, 0.237], and [$47, $107], respectively.14
Under arbitrary errors, identification of these utilization gaps deteriorates rapidly
as v departs from 1. For the reference case v = 0.92, for example, the difference in
the number of provider visits per month may lie anywhere between -0.135 and 0.472,
while the difference in expenditures may lie anywhere between -$40 and $117 (Table
2) . In neither case is the sign of A identified, even ignoring the additional uncertainty
associated with sampling variability. In fact, without imposing assumptions on the
patterns of errors, we cannot identify whether the insured were more likely to use
services than the uninsured unless v exceeds 0.95 (not shown). Similarly, we cannot
identify whether the insured had more provider visits unless v exceeds 0.98, nor can
we identify whether the insured had greater expenditures unless v exceeds 0.99. This
represents an important negative result: being almost fully confident in the accuracy
of the data is not enough, by itself, to be informative about even the sign of the uti
lization gap between the insured and uninsured.

C. Restrictions on reporting error patterns
The parameter bounds thus far have allowed for arbitrary patterns of insurance clas
sification errors, including the possibility that reporting errors are endogenously re
lated to true insurance status or the healthcare utilization outcome. In contrast, most
economic research presumes that measurement error is exogenous to the extent that
it exists at all. In this section, we make transparent the identifying power of two
common (nonnested) independence assumptions that tighten the Proposition 1
bounds. Then we introduce a weaker alternative assumption that is more plausible
in our context.
13. Gauss programs are available from the authors upon request.
14. Throughout this analysis, we compute confidence intervals around the estimated identification regions
using methods recently developed by Chernozhukov, Hong, and Tamer (2007). We use balanced repeated
replication methods to account for the complex survey design (Wolter 1985).

First, a researcher might consider an orthogonality assumption that insurance clas
sification errors arise independently of true insurance status:

(4) p(p = 1|Z*) =p(p = 1).
This assumption may be relatively innocuous compared with the set of homogeneity
and exogeneity assumptions imposed in standard parametric frameworks. Still, sto
ries can be told in which this assumption may be violated. Reporting errors may
not be orthogonal to true insurance status if, for example, better educated respond
ents are both more likely to be insured and more likely to accurately answer survey
questions. Similarly, Card, Hildreth, and Shore-Sheppard (2004) provide evidence
that errors in reporting Medicaid coverage vary with family income, which is also
a key aspect of Medicaid eligibility.
Alternatively, or in combination with Equation 4, a researcher might place restric
tions on the relationship between insurance classification errors and the use of health
services. In the popular classical measurement error framework, reported insurance
status does not depend on the level of healthcare utilization conditional on true in
surance status:

(5) P(/= l\r,U) = />(/ = l|/*)for/* =0,1.
Aigner (1973) and Bollinger (1996) study this type of "nondifferential" classifica
tion error for the case of a binary conditioning variable. When the independence As

sumption 5 holds, Bollingens Theorem 1 can be used to show that A is bounded
below by the reported utilization gap E(U\i ? \)?E(U\i = 0) (>0) as long as v ex
ceeds 0.50. Reflecting well-known attenuation bias associated with random measure
ment error, the magnitude of the reported utilization gap represents a downward
biased estimate of the magnitude of the true utilization gap. Berger, Black, and Scott
(1998) impose the nondifferential errors assumption in the only previous economet
ric analysis that allows for misreported insurance status.
Bound, Brown, and Mathiowetz (2001, p. 3725) note, however, that in general the
nondifferential measurement error assumption is strong and often implausible. In our
context, the nondifferential assumption is most likely to be violated if using health
care informs respondents about their true insurance status. For example, a healthcare

provider may enroll a patient in Medicaid. More generally, a regular user of health
services (or a user with high expenditures) presumably is more likely to know her
insurance status than an infrequent user of services.
We propose a weaker alternative assumption on the pattern of reporting errors.
Relaxing the nondifferential assumption in Equation 5, we suppose that the probability
of misreporting insurance status does not rise with the level of healthcare utilization:

(6) p(i = i|r = o, ux) < p(i = i\r = o, u0)
p{i = o\r = i, Ui) < p(i = o|r = l, u0)
for U\ ^ ?/o. The nondifferential assumption represents a special case. In the next
section, we illustrate how the identifying power of this monotone "nonincreasing er
ror rate" assumption compares with the standard nondifferential errors assumption.

D. Restricted error pattern results
Columns 2-4 in Table 2 illustrate the identifying power of these stronger assump
tions. In each column, restricting the patterns of reporting errors translates into con
siderably narrower bounds compared with the arbitrary errors case. We focus
primarily on the relatively weak "nonincreasing errors" bounds in Column 4 that
do not require any independence assumptions.15
Recall that we cannot identify the sign of A for provider visits under arbitrary
errors unless at least 98 percent of the unverified responses are known to be accurate;
for expenditures, the corresponding critical value is 99 percent. Under the nonin
creasing errors assumption, however, the critical values fall dramatically to 78 per

cent and 64 percent, respectively (not shown). For the reference case v = 0.92
under nonincreasing errors, A is estimated to lie within [0.133, 0.264] for the mean
number of visits per month and within [$68, $85] for expenditures (Table 2). These
bounds for visits are 0.066 visits wider than the corresponding nondifferential errors
bounds in Column 3, but they are 0.476 visits narrower than the arbitrary errors
bounds in Column 1. Similarly, the nonincreasing errors bounds for expenditures
are $14 wider than the nondifferential errors bounds, but they are $140 narrower
than the arbitrary errors bounds. The comparisons are similar after accounting for
sampling variability.

IV. Utilization under Universal Health Insurance
We now turn to inferences about healthcare utilization under a hypo
thetical policy of universal health insurance. Let U(I* = 1) denote the amount of
health services an individual would have used in July 1996 if insured. This outcome
is observed in the data only for sample members who are verified to be currently in
sured; it is unobserved for those verified to be uninsured and for those whose insur

ance status is not verified. We wish to learn the population's expected utilization if
everyone were insured, E[U(I* = 1)]. If current insurance status were randomly
assigned, then the utilization among the currently insured, E(U\I* = 1), would rep
resent the best prediction of the utilization rate under universal coverage. Since /* is
not observed for all individuals, we could instead bound E(U\F = 1) using the meth
ods derived in the previous sections. As discussed earlier, however, the observed dis
tribution of health insurance coverage in the population is not randomly assigned.
Instead, insurance status is affected by characteristics potentially related to the use
of medical resources.

In the absence of random assignment or other assumptions, the quantity
E[U(I* = 1)] is not identified even if reported insurance status is always accurate.
Unlike identification of the conditional utilization rate E(U\I* = 1), identification
of the "treatment" outcome E[U(I* = 1)] requires knowledge about the counterfac
tual utilization rate of the uninsured had they instead been insured. Uncertainty about

15. We numerically computed bounds under the various assumptions by searching over logically allowed

combinations of false positives and false negatives {6~, 6'~, 6 + , 6'?}

Kreider and Hill 425
the accuracy of reported insurance status, the focus of the current paper, further com
plicates identification of counterfactuals.
To bound the impact of universal coverage on utilization, we begin by using the
law of total probability to decompose the projected utilization rate under universal
coverage into verified and unverified current insurance status:

(7) E[U(T = 1)] = E[U(r = 1)\y = 1}p(y = 1)
+ E[U{P = l)\y = 0]P(y = 0).
The data identify p(y = 1) and p(y = 0) but neither utilization term. The first term
involving verified insurance status can be written as

(8) E[U(P = l)\y = 1] = E(U\r = 1, y = l)pu

+ E[U{r = l)\r=0,y=l](l-pn)

where pn=p(i* ? \\y ? 1) denotes the status quo insurance rate among verified
cases. All the terms in Equation 8 are observed except for the counterfactual expected

utilization among the uninsured under the status quo, E[U(i* = 1)|7* = 0, y = 1].
Without additional assumptions, this quantity may lie anywhere within the support
of U, [0, supt/].
Returning to Equation 7 and decomposing the third term involving the unverified

cases obtains

(9) E[U{T = 1)|F = 0] = E(U\P = 1,7 = 0)P10
+ ?[?/(/* = l)|/* ==0,F = 0](1-P10)
where p\o = p(P = 1|7 = 0) is the status quo insurance rate among unverified
cases. None of the quantities in Equation 9 are identified. We do not know p\0,
and we cannot match healthcare use outcomes to insurance status when insurance
status is unknown. Introducing this framework under the implicit assumption that
v = 0, Molinari's (Forthcoming) innovative analysis shows that we can learn some
thing about the first term, E(U\i* = 1, y = 0), if the researcher has outside informa
tion restricting the range of P10 (denoted p in her framework).16 She estimates the
treatment effect of drug use on employment when drug use is unobserved for part
of the sample. We extend her analysis in two dimensions when v > 0.
First, an assumption on v translates into internally generated restrictions on Pio as
a function of v. We can write the unobserved insurance rate among unverified cases,
Pio, as a function of the reported rate and unobserved misclassification rates:

p10 = p(/=i|y = o)
+ p(i = o,z* = o|y = o)-p(/ = i,z* = o\y = o).
Allowing the unidentified terms to vary over their feasible ranges obtains

^io e [?io,?io] where
16. In Molinari's framework, 7 = 0 (our notation) denotes survey nonresponse instead of lack of verifica
tion. Molinari (2008) presents a general treatment of the identification problem for a variety of measure

ment issues.

[ } p10 = p(/= l|y = 0) + min{l-v,P(/ = 0|y = 0)}.
When v = 0, P\o is trivially bounded to lie within [0,1]; at the other extreme when

v=l,P10=i>(/=l|y = 0).

Second, considering a positive value of v allows us to restrict the expected utiliza
tion rate among the unverifiably truly uninsured, E(U\I* = 0, Y = 0), which in turn
allows us to tighten Molinari's bounds on the expected utilization rate among the

unverifiably truly insured, E(U\I* = 1,7 = 0). Her framework can be used to pro
vide sharp bounds at v = 0 and v = 1. Proposition 2 allows us to fill in identification
patterns for values of v between 0 and 1. For a particular value of v, we can bound the

population's use of health services under universal coverage as follows:17

Proposition 2. Given P(Z* ? \\Y = 0) >v and a known value P\o G [?io(v),
^io(v)], the population's healthcare utilization rate under mandatory universal in
surance coverage is sharply bounded as follows:

E(U\I

mm{$(v),P(U < f,/ = 0,y = 0)}.

17. This analysis does not account for potential increases in gross prices for healthcare resulting from uni

versal coverage. Since such price increases would not increase utilization, these upper bounds on
E(U\I = 1) should still apply. For our main analysis, we also assume that insurance coverage to the unin
sured would be representative of the current mix of public and private coverage available to the insured.

Kreider and Hill 427
If Pio is unknown, the lower and upper bounds in Equation 11 are replaced by the
infimum and supremum, respectively, of these bounds over values ofP\o G [fin^io]

Proof: See Appendix 1.
The proof follows the general outline of Molinari's (Forthcoming) Proposition 1 der
ivation. Her Proposition 1 is similar except that her counterparts for the probability
distributions Gl and G# implicitly assume that v = 0 such that nothing is known
about the reliability of unverified classifications. For that case, the bounds in Equa

tion 11 collapse to her bounds after setting (li(f,v) = 0, ^(t^v) = 1, and
[?ioj^io] = [0,1]. She also allows for the possibility that the researcher has outside
information restricting P\o to a range narrower than [0,1], including the possibility

that P\o is known. In that case, something can be learned about E[U(I* = 1)|
Y = 0] even though Cti = 0 and H2 ? 1- Her bounds are as narrow as possible given
her imposed assumptions.
In the special case that current insurance status is known to be accurately mea
sured (v = 1), the Proposition 2 bounds collapse to the following well-known bounds

(Manski 1995):

E{U\I = l)P{I = 1) < E[U(r = 1)] < E(U\I = l)P(I = 1) + P(I = 0)sup(7.
Given the absence of reporting errors in this case, the width of these bounds depends

only on the proportion uninsured, P(I = 0), and the uninsured's upper bound use of
services in the counterfactual state of being insured, supU.
For the binary utilization case, supU in Proposition 2 is naturally set equal to 1.
Yet there is no natural limit to the number of provider visits or dollars spent on med
ical services. Unless a researcher is nevertheless willing to set an upper bound on U,
it must be recognized that an informative upper bound on E[U(I* = 1)] cannot be
logically identified under the weak conditions specified in Proposition 2. For our
Proposition 2 empirical results, we set supU to 1.82 for number of visits and to
$862 for expenditures reflecting mean values among individuals who (1) perceived
themselves to be in poor health at the time of the first interview and (2) were verified
to be privately insured. These values reflect the 92nd percentile for visits and the 98th

percentile for expenditures. We do not require any assumptions on supU for the
Proposition 3 bounds or monotone instrumental variable (MIV) bounds that follow.
We conservatively treat the insurance rate among unverified classifications, Pl0, as
unknown. Therefore, we allow this value to lie anywhere within its logically consis
tent range [P10,^io]> conditional on v (see the last part of Proposition 2).

A. Monotonicity Assumptions
The preceding bounds can be narrowed substantially under common monotonicity
assumptions on treatment response and treatment selection. The monotone treatment
response assumption (MTR), introduced by Manski (1997), specifies that an individ
ual's utilization is at least as high in the insured state as in the uninsured state:

(12) Ui{r = 1) > Ui(i* = 0).
Given moral hazard, we would expect some individuals to increase their use of health
services upon becoming insured; presumably, the use of services would not decline.

428 The Journal of Human Resources

Under a monotone treatment selection (MTS) assumption introduced in Manski and
Pepper (2000), expected utilization under either "treatment" (insured or uninsured)
would be at least as high among the currently insured as among the currently uninsured:

(13) E[u(r=j)\r = i]>E[u(r=j)\r = o] for 7 = 0,1.
The MTS assumption is related to adverse selection: those who have self-selected
themselves into the insured state may tend to be more prone to use health services
than their uninsured counterparts.18 While the MTS assumption would presumably
not hold for certain subpopulations, we only require that the tendency holds on av
erage for the nonelderly population as a whole.
In support of the aggregate MTS assumption, public insurance programs already
cover some of the least healthy populations. For example, people with substantial
disabilities (who typically need considerable healthcare) are often insured by Med
icaid or Medicare. Most states also use the Medicaid medically needy option to pro
vide coverage to families with children whose healthcare expenditures are quite
substantial relative to their incomes. More generally, those at relatively low risk of
needing health services are less likely to seek coverage, as are people less predis
posed to seek health services. For example, low demand for insurance may partly re
flect preferences for avoiding medical care (Vistnes and Monheit 2008). Using the
Community Tracking Household Survey, Hirth et al (2006) estimate that 86 percent
of workers who were not offered insurance at their job have low demand for insur
ance. Compared with workers who are offered insurance at their job, they find that
workers who are not offered insurance tend to be younger, have lower family
incomes, and have less education - all factors associated with lower healthcare use. In
contrast, however, some of the uninsured may have found it difficult to obtain insurance

at affordable prices due to preexisting conditions. Yet while medical underwriting can be
a barrier to obtaining private insurance, data from the 1996 MEPS indicate that less than 3
percent of uninsured adults were "ever denied health insurance because of poor health."

Some evidence of aggregate adverse selection has been reported in parametric stud
ies of the effects of insurance. Using data from the MEPS to estimate a model of private
insurance coverage and office-based doctor visits, Deb, Munkin, and Trivedi (2006) find

that half of the observed lower healthcare use among uninsured adults compared with
privately insured adults can be attributed to self-selection rather than the lack of insur

ance. Dor, Sudano, and Baker (2006) find similar evidence of selection into private in
surance.19 If aggregate MTS does not hold in the population, however, then the
Proposition 3 upper bound (see below) reverts to the Proposition 2 upper bound.
When both MTR and MTS hold, a result in Manski and Pepper (2000, Corollary

2.2) implies

18. The MTS assumption relaxes the commonly imposed "exogenous treatment selection" (ETS) assump

tion, E[U(I* = j)\I* = 1] = E[U(I* = j)\I* = Ojfory = {0,1}, that assumes away the possibility of self
selection (see Manski and Pepper 2000, p. 1001).
19. However, the findings by Deb, Munkin, and Trivedi (2006) and Dor, Sudano, and Baker (2006) rely in
part on the types of parametric assumptions we are trying to avoid.

The lower bound on the population's use of services under universal coverage is
E(U), the status quo national utilization rate in the absence of universal coverage.
The upper bound is the status quo utilization rate among those currently insured. This

result combined with the upper bound on E(U\I* = 1) derived in Proposition 1 leads
to the following proposition:
Proposition 3. Suppose that the MTR and MTS assumptions hold across the pop
ulation and P(Z* = l\Y = 0)>v. Then the expected use of services under insurance

coverage is bounded above by JUdFi where

F
m=_P(t7 _
U ; P(I= l)-a? + min{(|)(v) -a} ,P(U > tj = 0, Y = 0)}'
{ min{<|>(v),P(l/ < *,/ = l,Y = 0)} if 8f<0
max{0,min{P(t/ < t:I = 1, Y = 0), 4>(v)

-P(U> tj = 0, Y = 0)}} otherwise

and 8f = = l)-P(?/>f,/= l)-<|)(v).

In the empirical work that follows, we also consider the additional identifying power

of the independence and nonincreasing errors assumptions considered in Section

IIIC.

B. Universal Coverage Results
The fraction of the nonelderly population that used health services in July 1996 was
0.206, and the mean number of provider visits and expenditures were 0.412 and $99,
respectively. We are interested in placing worst-case bounds on average utilization
outcomes under a policy of mandated health insurance coverage. Our main analysis
presumes that new coverage extended to the uninsured would be representative of the
current mix of public and private coverage available to the insured. Later, we con
sider policies that would cover the uninsured by expanding public programs.
In the absence of monotonicity or independence assumptions, the Proposition 2
bounds apply. Point estimates of these bounds, along with 95 percent confidence
intervals, are presented in Table 3, Column 1. Under the standard implicit assumption
that insurance status is reported accurately, v = 1, we estimate that the fraction of the
nonelderly population using health services in July if everyone became insured

would lie in the range [0.182, 0.374], with 95 percent confidence interval [0.173,
0.383]. In percentage terms, the impact would lie within the range [-12 percent,
+82 percent], with 95 percent confidence interval [-16 percent, +86 percent]. The es
timated upper bounds on mean provider visits and expenditures per month are 0.712
(+73 percent) and $258 (+161 percent), respectively, which rise to 0.735 (+78 per
cent) and $281 (+184 percent) after accounting for sampling variability. In each case,
the identification uncertainty associated with unknown counterfactual outcomes is
much greater than the uncertainty associated with sampling variability. Clearly, we
cannot learn much about the impact of universal coverage without imposing stronger
assumptions, even if there is no uncertainty about the accuracy of status quo classi
fications. Figures 1-3 trace out the 95 percent confidence intervals for any use, visits,

These bounds can be narrowed further under stronger assumptions about the pat
terns of reporting errors. Columns 3 and 4 in Table 3 present bounds on E[U(I* = 1)]

under the orthogonality and nondifferential errors assumptions, respectively, dis
cussed in Section IIIC. We focus especially on the more plausible "nonincreasing
errors" assumption in which the prevalence of insurance status misreporting falls

weakly with the level of utilization. These results are presented in Column 5. When
v = 0.92, the mean number of visits per month among the nonelderly population
would rise to no more than 0.463 (a 12 percent increase) under universal coverage,
while per capita monthly expenditures would rise to no more than $117 (an 18 per
cent increase).

C. Monotone Instrumental Variables
We next use monotone instrumental variables (MIV) techniques developed by Manski
and Pepper (2000) and extended by Kreider and Pepper (2007) to assess how the
Proposition 3 bounds can be narrowed when combined with monotonicity assump
tions linking utilization outcomes and observed covariates such as age or health sta
tus. Consider age and use of health services. The incidence of many health conditions
rises with age, and many health conditions are persistent once developed. These ten
dencies suggest that, on average, utilization among adults under universal coverage
would be nondecreasing in age. If this assumption holds, then we can improve upon
the previously derived bounds by enforcing the restriction that upper bounds identi
fied for younger groups cannot exceed upper bounds identified for older groups.
We treat age and general health status as MIVs. We divide the population into 18
age groups: 0-30, 31-32, 33-34, 63-64.20 Within each age group, we assume that
use of services under universal coverage would be nondecreasing in reported worse
general health across the following categories: poor/fair, good, very good, and excel
lent. Formally, consider the utilization rate within some age group, age' (the exten
sion to multiple MIV dimensions is straightforward). The age MIV assumption implies
the following inequality restriction:

(15) agei < age' < age2=>E[U{I* = l)\age{)]
< E[U(T = l)\age')\ < E[U(P = l)\age2)}.
This mean monotonicity condition for an instrument relaxes the more typical (and
stronger) mean independence assumption. Under mean independence, the inequal
ities across the expectations in Equation 15 would be replaced with equalities (Manski
and Pepper 2000). In our application, however, it is not obvious where to find instru
ments that would satisfy mean independence.
The conditional expectations in Equation 15 are not identified, but they can be
bounded using the methods described above. Let LB(age) and UB(age) be the known
lower and upper bounds, respectively, given the available information on E(U\
I*, age); in computing these bounds, we assume that MTR and MTS continue to
hold. (Under the MTS assumption, note that the treatment / is itself an MIV.) Then
using Manski and Pepper (2000, Proposition 1), we have

20. For the youngest group, we conservatively choose an age range that extends well into adulthood. New
borns tend to use substantial care, but then the use of services tends to decline with a child's age as the
frequency of recommended preventive care visits decreases. Use of services tends to rise again in adulthood
with the onset of chronic conditions.

Thus, to find the MIV bounds on the utilization rate, one takes the app
weighted average of the lower and upper bounds across the different val
instrument. This MIV estimator is consistent but biased in finite samples. T
for this bias, we employ Kreider and Pepper's (2007) modified MIV estim
estimates and adjusts for finite-sample bias.21
While there is substantial debate in the literature about the appropriaten
reported health variables in regression models of employment (see, for
Bound 1991), the MIV assumption does not require reported health stat
unbiased indicator of true health status or to be exogenously reported. W
quired is that utilization under universal coverage would be nondecreas
and reported health status.22
The MIV assumptions cannot be verified by the data because the expect
Equation 15 involve unobserved counterfactual utilization outcomes; more
do not observe status quo insurance status in the presence of reporting e
joint assumption that v = 1 and MIV-MTS hold, however, potentially can
by the data using a test similar to one suggested by Manski and Pepper (
note 9). For each age group, agej, and health category, Hk, the following

must hold:

E{U\I=l,agej,Hk)=E[U(I=l)\I=l,agej,Hk]
< E[U(I=l)\I=l,ager,Hk.}=E(U\I=l,ager,Hk>) for; </,* < k*.
Thus, in the absence of measurement error, E(U\I = 1, agej, Hk) should be mono
tonic in age and reported health. For each pair of adjacent age and health status
groups among the reportedly insured, we conducted a one-sided test of whether uti
lization is decreasing in age and/or in worse health. We conducted identical tests for

21. See Kreider and Pepper (2007) for estimation details.
22. Health status is routinely included as an explanatory variable in parametric studies of the effects of in

surance on service use and expenditures, along with an implicit assumption of homogeneity of effects
across individuals. While reported health status is difficult to quantify in surveys and may be mismeasured,
reported general health has external validity in that it predicts mortality and changes in functioning (Idler
and Benyamini 1997; Idler and Kasl 1995). We do not use reports of chronic conditions, which tend to be
misreported; the uninsured are especially likely to underreport conditions because they are less likely to
seek care and acquire diagnoses (Baker, Stabile, and Deri 2004; Miller, Banthin, and Moeller 2004).

Kreider and Hill 437
the probability of service use, number of visits, and expenditures. One test for visits
was rejected at the 5 percent significance level, but this is not statistically significant
after accounting for the multiplicity of tests. As seen in Table 4, the nonelderly pop

ulation's use of hospital or ambulatory services among the reportedly insured is
roughly monotonic in age and perceived health status. After accounting for sampling
variability, we cannot reject the hypothesis that utilization is monotonic in these
attributes. This is consistent with the many studies that have found that reported
health status strongly predicts service use and expenditures (Balkrishnan, Anderson,
and Bowton 2000; Bierman et al 1999; DeSalvo et al 2005; Miilupalo et al 1997).

D. MIV Results
MIV results are presented in the last two columns of Table 3, assuming MTR and
MTS continue to hold. The identifying power of the MIV assumption can be assessed
by comparing Columns 2 and 6 for the case of arbitrary error patterns and by com
paring Columns 5 and 7 for the case of "nonincreasing errors." We focus on the lat
ter comparison for v = 0.92. In Column 5, we estimate that the fraction of the
nonelderly population using health services in a month would rise no more than
13 percent above the status quo to 0.232. Under the additional MIV assumption in
Column 7, we estimate that this fraction would rise no more than 9 percent to
0.224. Improvements in the upper bounds for mean number of visits and expendi
tures are similar. Under the MIV assumption, the upper bound on the number of visits
per month improves from 0.463 to 0.444, and the upper bound on expenditures
improves from $117 to $115. Thus, in this setting, visits would increase no more than
8 percent under universal coverage and expenditures per capita would increase no

more than 16 percent. In what follows, we refer to these estimates as our preferred

bounds.

E. Expanding Public Coverage
To this point, our analysis presumes that the package of health benefits made avail
able to the uninsured under universal coverage would reflect the mixture of benefits
available to the privately and publicly insured under the status quo. Many recent pro
posals for extending health insurance to the uninsured, however, involve expansions
of existing public programs like Medicaid. As part of our sensitivity analysis, we in
vestigate how the estimated bounds in Table 3 would change if we focus attention on
policies that would cover the uninsured through expansions of public insurance. To
do so, we repeat the preceding nonparametric bounds analysis over the subsample of
individuals classified as uninsured or publicly insured. Within this subsample, we es
timate upper bounds on utilization under a policy that extends public insurance to the
uninsured. Upper-bound utilization rates (for any use, visits, and expenditures) for
the entire nonelderly population are then computed as a weighted average of these
upper bounds for the non-privately insured and the status quo utilization rates of
the privately insured.
This approach requires two simplifying assumptions. First, we assume that reports
of private coverage are accurate; any insurance classification errors are confined to
errors among the reportedly uninsured and publicly insured. For cases in which val
idation data are available in the MEPS, Hill (2007/2008) finds that private insurance
is very accurately reported?most respondents are aware of whether they have pri
vate coverage. In contrast, there is evidence of more extensive misreporting of public
coverage in surveys (Call et al. 2007; Card, Hildreth, Shore-Sheppard 2004; Davern
et al. 2007). In our restricted sample that excludes the privately insured, the propor
tion of inaccurate insurance classifications is likely to be higher. To account for this
greater uncertainty, we replace the thresholds v = 0.92 and v = 0.84 considered in
the main analysis with the lower thresholds v = 0.89 and v = 0.77.
Second, our approach presumes that service use by the currently privately insured
would not rise due to the expansion of public insurance. Like the studies by Hadley
and Holahan (2003) and Miller, Banthin, and Moeller (2004), we do not attempt to
estimate the potential consequences of "crowd out" in which some people with pri
vate coverage might switch to the newly available public coverage. Based on the lit
erature reviewed by Duchovny and Nelson (2007), switchers from private policies
would likely comprise between a quarter to a half of new enrollees under an ex
panded public insurance program. Our derived upper bounds in this section are valid
if the switchers would use no more care, on average, under their new public policies.
While public programs that require small or no premium payments are potentially
attractive to many private policyholders, a priori it is not clear whether on balance
differences in benefits and providers would differentially attract less healthy, pri
vately insured people to public coverage or repel them. Medicaid and SCHIP pro
grams tend to have generous cost sharing and cover more services than private
insurance, which would disproportionately attract the less healthy. On the other hand,

Medicaid typically pays providers lower fees than private insurance, and lower fees
reduce provider willingness to participate in the Medicaid program and reduce

Kreider and Hill 439
enrollees' access to care (Cohen 1993; Mitchell 1991). Econometric studies find
similar access to care in public and private programs (Long, Coughlin, and Kling
2005; Seiden and Hudson 2006), which suggests that any incentive or disincentive
for less healthy individuals to switch from private to public coverage is likely
small.24 If, on balance, healthier privately insured people (or people otherwise less
prone to use care) would be attracted to public coverage, then our estimates remain
valid upper bounds. If the opposite is true, then the bounds depend on supU and
hence would be wide.
Table 5 presents our estimated upper bounds on the impacts of expanding public
coverage. The estimates are broadly similar to those presented in Table 3, but the up
per bounds that incorporate MTR and MTS are uniformly higher for a given degree
of confidence in the data. These higher values do not imply that healthcare expenses
would necessarily be higher under public expansions than under a mixture of public
and private expansions. Instead, the higher upper bounds reflect more uncertainty about
the impacts of public expansions. Recall from Table 1 that the status quo use of health
services is greater among the publicly insured than among the privately insured. These
differences are reflected in the upper bounds. Moreover, the confidence intervals are
wider for expanding public coverage than for covering the uninsured with a mix of pri

vate and public insurance. These wider intervals reflect smaller samples of people
reporting public coverage than people reporting any insurance.
When v = 1 and the MIV assumption is not imposed, the upper bound on the mean
number of monthly provider visits per month by the nonelderly population under uni

versal coverage rises from 0.448 with a mix of private and public coverage (Table 3)

to 0.473 with expanded public coverage (Table 5). The upper bound on mean
monthly expenditures rises from $114 to $121. When the MIV assumption is addi
tionally imposed, the upper bound on visits rises from 0.440 to 0.457, and the upper
bound on expenditures rises from $114 to $120. Our preferred results presented in
Column 7 impose MIV with nonincreasing errors. When v = 0.89, the fraction of
the nonelderly population using services during a month under expanded public in
surance would rise no more than 14 percent to 0.235, the mean number of monthly
visits would rise no more than 22 percent to 0.503, and mean monthly expenditures
would rise no more than 26 percent to $125.

V. Comparisons with Parametric Studies
Parametric point estimates of increased healthcare utilization under
universal coverage lie within our preferred estimated bounds. These estimates, which

impose MTR, MTS, MIV, and "nonincreasing errors," are reported in Table 3, Col
umn 7 with v = 0.92 when expanded coverage involves a mixture of public and

23. Hadley and Holahan (2003/2004) provide evidence that public coverage reduces health expenditures
relative to private coverage, consistent with lower fees paid to providers by Medicaid than by private in
surance.

24. Several econometric studies of service use find no differential impact of private relative to public cov
erage for a variety of populations and measures of service use (Glied et al. 1998; Hadley and Holahan 2003;

private insurance and in Table 5; they are reported in Column 7 with v = 0.89 when
public coverage is extended to the uninsured.
In parametric studies, Miller, Banthin, and Moeller (2004) and Hadley and Holahan
(2003) estimate that expanding public programs to cover all the uninsured would in
crease annual total expenditures between 9 percent and 10 percent. Our correspond
ing nonparametric upper bound when v = 0.89 is 26 percent. Their estimates, like
our own, do not account for any crowding out of private coverage. Their models as
sume no measurement error, and self-selection into insured status is allowed only
through a set of observed characteristics. One likely reason our worst-case upper
bounds are substantially higher than their point estimates is that we do not impose
the homogeneity assumption that the impact of insurance coverage on utilization
is identical across individuals with the same observed characteristics. Miller, Banthin,
and Moeller and Hadley and Holahan also estimate that covering the uninsured with
private insurance would increase annual total expenditures between 11 percent and
17 percent, depending on their specific assumptions. For Massachusetts, Blumberg
et al (2006) estimate the impact of potential expansions that would resemble the
mixture of private and public coverage expansions enacted in that state. They esti
mate that expenditures would increase by about 12 percent.25 Our corresponding up
per bound when v = 0.92 is 16 percent.

Buchmueller et al (2005) review studies of the impacts of insurance on the
amount of service use. Relying on a variety of comparison methods, parametric stud
ies find that having insurance increases visits among the uninsured between 16 per
cent and 106 percent. More recent studies, however, find a narrower range of effects.
Seiden and Hudson (2006) estimate that expanding public insurance to cover unin
sured children would increase their annual probability of having an ambulatory visit
by 54 percent, corresponding to an increase of about 7 percent across the nonelderly
population as a whole. They find that private coverage would increase the annual
probability by 61 percent, corresponding to an increase of about 8 percent across
the population as a whole. Estimates in Deb, Munkin, and Trivedi (2006) suggest that
expanding private insurance to uninsured adults would increase their number of of
fice-based visits by about 46 percent, corresponding to an increase for the adult pop
ulation of about 5 percent. Hadley and Holahan (2003), who do not account for
unobserved factors, estimate that public coverage would increase the annual number
of office-based visits among the uninsured by 41 percent, while private insurance
would increase visits by 30 percent. Their estimates correspond to increases of 5 per
cent and 4 percent, respectively, among all nonelderly. For expansions involving a
mixture of private and public insurance, our estimated upper bound on the increase
in monthly office-based and hospital outpatient visits is 8 percent.

VI. Conclusion
Policymakers have long been interested in identifying the conse

quences of uninsurance for access to healthcare and the potential impacts of
25. They model premiums, rather than healthcare expenditures, so their estimates implicitly include insur

ance loading as well as expenditures for healthcare services.

universal coverage (for example, Institute of Medicine 2003). Identification of pol
icy outcomes, however, is confounded by both the unobservability of counterfac
tuals and the potential unreliability of self-reported insurance status. To account
for these two distinct types of uncertainty, we developed a nonparametric frame
work that extends the literature on partially identified probability distributions
and treatment effects. Using the new analytical results, we provided tight bounds
on the impact of universal health insurance on provider visits and medical expen
ditures. As part of the paper's contribution, we showed how to partially identify the
conditional mean of a random variable for the case that a binary conditioning var
iable?in our case health insurance?is subject to arbitrary endogenous measure
ment error.
Our conservative statistical approach provides informative bounds on parameters
of interest without imposing parametric assumptions. We began by corroborating
self-reported insurance status for a nonrandom portion of the MEPS sample using
outside information from insurance cards and followback interviews with employers
and insurance companies. We allowed for the possibility of insurance reporting
errors within the remainder of the sample and illustrated the sensitivity of our empir
ical results to alternative verification, monotonicity, and independence assumptions.

For our preferred estimates, we introduced a "nonincreasing errors" assumption that
relaxes the strict nondifferential independence assumption embodied in the classical
errors-in-variables framework. In our application, the weaker monotonicity assump
tion retains much of the identifying power of the independence assumption while
allowing for the possibility that using health services may inform a patient of her true
insurance status.
Our primary analysis considers the impact of extending insurance to the uninsured
using the mix of public and private coverage prevalent under the status quo. Pro
grams intended to cover the uninsured in Massachusetts, Maine, and Vermont, and
proposals by some presidential candidates, would cover the uninsured with both pri
vate and public insurance. We estimate that the fraction of the nonelderly population
using ambulatory or hospital services would rise no more than 9 percent under uni
versal coverage. We further estimate that per capita monthly provider visits would
rise by no more than 8 percent, and mean expenditures per month would rise no more
than 16 percent. These estimated upper bounds rely on an assumption that no more
than 8 percent of unverified insurance classifications are misreported. While the ac
curacy of unverified insurance responses cannot logically be known, we have relaxed
the standard implicit assumption that all classifications are known to be accurate. Un

der our preferred monotonicity assumptions, we find that our estimates are not par

ticularly sensitive to the degree of reporting error within plausible ranges. This
suggests that, contrary to some assertions, uncertainty about the number of uninsured
may not be a major impediment to developing programs to cover the uninsured. Our

estimated upper bounds on the effects of expanding public coverage, however, are
not as tight.
Our analysis has several limitations. First, the cost of covering the uninsured will
depend in part on the generosity of benefits, but our treatment effect approach
ignores heterogeneity across plan types in treating insurance as binary. Second,
our most informative bounds rely on an unverifiable assumption that, on average,

households who tend to use more health services have already self-selected

themselves into the insured state. While we impose this assumption only across the
nonelderly population as a whole (allowing for the possibility that this tendency is
reversed within some subpopulations), the validity of the assumption cannot be di
rectly verified. Third, our methods are less useful for estimating the cost of covering
an additional person. Marginal analyses require stronger assumptions about the char
acteristics of the newly insured. Finally, the healthcare system continues to evolve,
and our 1996 data (which contain the best available validation information) were
gathered before SCHIP was implemented.
The methods developed in this paper can be applied to a wide range of topics that
involve identification of conditional expectations or treatment effects given uncer
tainty about the accuracy of a conditioning variable. Our framework, for example,
offers an alternative approach to Blau and Gilleskie's (2001) parametric analysis
of the impact of employer-provided retiree health insurance on retirement outcomes.
In the Health and Retirement Study data used in their study, about 13 percent of the
respondents nearing retirement age said they were unsure about whether they had re
tiree insurance?thus forming a natural subpopulation of respondents to be charac
terized as providing unreliable treatment information. The methods in this paper
could be used to bound the effects of retiree insurance on employment, informing
policymakers about the potential consequences of allowing retirees younger than
65 to purchase Medicare coverage. More generally, we expect this developing line
of research to improve researchers' understanding of the consequences of nonclassi
cal measurement error for inferences, which should in turn yield more informed pol
icy analyses.

APPENDIX 1
Proofs
Proof of Proposition 1. To place bounds on A, we begin by logically determining the
lowest feasible value of P(U ^ t\P = 1). Differentiating the right hand side of Equa
tion 3, we find that this quantity is increasing in 0J+, the unobserved fraction of indi
viduals with U> t misclassified as being insured, and in 6~, the unobserved fraction
of individuals with U < t misclassified as being uninsured. As a worst-case possibil

ity for the lower bound, we must therefore set 0J+ = 6~ =0 to obtain:

(18) P{U*W = l)-*U
p(/ = i)-e,+ +e;~
While 0+ and 0'~ are unobserved, their ranges are restricted. The unobserved frac

tion that was falsely classified as insured, 0* = P(U ^ t,I = 1,Z* =0), cannot ex

ceed the observed fraction that was classified as insured with unknown insured
status. Nor can this fraction exceed the total allowed fraction of misclassified cases,
cj)(v) = (1? v)P(Y = 0). Similarly, the unobserved fraction of individuals that was

falsely classified as being uninsured, Q't~ = P(U > t,I = 0,Z* =0), cannot exceed
the observed fraction that was classified as being uninsured with unknown insured
status; nor can it exceed the total fraction of misclassified cases:

o < e; < min{(()(v),p(c/ < *,/ = i,y = o)} = e?
0 < er ^ min{(()(v),P(L/>r,/ = 0,F = 0)} = er".
To find the lower bound of P(U ^t\I* = 1), we must find the minimum feasible
value for the right-hand side of Equation 18. Therefore, for any candidate value of
0*, we need d't~ to attain its maximum allowed value conditional on 6*:

6; " = min{c()(v)-0/ , } = min{<|>(v)-8r+ ,P{U > tj = 0, Y = 0)}.
The objective then becomes one of minimizing

(19)

p(u < t.i = i)-e+
P(/= l)-0+ +min{c|)(v)-e;,P(r/>r,/ = 0,y = 0)}

over feasible values of 0*.
Define 0+? = <|)(v)-P(U > t, I = 0, Y = 0), the critical value of 0+ that makes the
two arguments in the min function equal. First consider values of 0+ < 0*0. For such
values, the derivative of Equation 19 with respect to 0* is negative; therefore,
we can_ exclude as potential candidates any values of 0* less than 0*min = max{0,
min< 0*, 0*? > >. For 0*>0+?, the derivative has the same sign as

(20) 8f = < tj= l)-P(U>t,I= 1)?<J>(v).
When this quantity is negative, we must raise 0+ to its maximum feasible value,
0+; otherwise, we set 0+ equal to 0*^. Similar logic provides an upper bound on

P(U < 1|/* = 1). After defining bf =P(U>tJ = \ )-P(U<tJ = 1)?cf>(v), the
preceding results establish Proposition 1.
Proof of Proposition 2. Using Molinari's (Forthcoming, p. 9) decomposition for
the case of missing observations, we begin by writing the distribution of U among
unverified cases as a weighted average of the distributions among unverified insured
and uninsured cases:

(21) P(U <t\Y = 0) = P(U< t\P = \,Y= 0)Pio + P(U < t\P = 0, Y = 0)(1 -Pio).
First consider a particular value of P\q g (0,1). Solving for the fraction consuming
U^t among the unverified currently insured implies

(22) P(U * t\P = 1,7=0)=^^ = W * - ??Y = W-P?\
The quantity P(U<t\I* = 0, Y ? 0) in the right-hand-side can be rewritten as

(23) P{U < t\r = o, y = o) = -

p(u < r,/ = o,y = 0) + e,+ -b;
(l-Pl0)P(Y = 0)

The upper bound on this quantity is obtained by setting 0, =_0 and 0* equal to its
maximum feasible value. From Section III A, we know 0* < 0*. Combined with the

requirement that P(U < t\P = 0. Y = 0) < 1, the value of 0+ is restricted to lie in the

range 0 < 0* < ?* (where is defined in the proposition). The lower bound is
obtained by setting 0* = 0 and 0~ equal to its maximum feasible value, where 0~
is restricted to lie in the range 0 < 0" < ?7". Thus, P(U < f |7* = 0, F = 0) in Equa
tion 23 is bounded to lie within [CL{ (t, v), ft2(f, v)]. Varying P(?/ < t\P = 0, F = 0)
in Equation 22 within this feasible range reveals that P(U ^ t\P = 1,7 = 0) must
lie within the range [Gx(r, v),G#(f, v)].26 Integrating across values of r, expected
healthcare utilization among the unverifiably truly insured is bounded as follows:

f/JG// < ?(f/|7* = 1, Y = 0) < / UdGi.
Continuing with the case P\$ ? (0,1), applying this result to the first term in Equa
tion 9 and varying E[U(I* = 1)|7* = 0, Y = j] within [0, supU] for j = 0,1 in Equa
tions 8 and 9 yields the Proposition 2 bounds. These bounds also apply when P\o is

1 or 0. In the former case, E[U(P = l)\Y = 0)] in Equation 9 is identified as

E(U\P = l,y = 0) =E(U\Y = 0) since E(U\Y = 0) = E(U\I* = 1, F = 0)Pi0 +
?(t/|7* = 0, y = 0)(1-P10). For Pio = 0, we only know that E[U(r = l)\Y =
0)] = E[U(P = 1)|7* = 0, Y = 0)] e [0, supl/].
