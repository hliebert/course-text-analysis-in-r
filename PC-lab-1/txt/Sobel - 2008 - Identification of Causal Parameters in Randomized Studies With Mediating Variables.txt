Typically, subjects assigned to a treatment group are compared to subjects in a
control group and mediation is assessed using recursive linear structural equation
models, employing criteria proposed by Kenny and his collaborators (e.g., Baron
& Kenny, 1986; Judd & Kenny, 1981a, 1981b). The path diagram corresponding

and Dwyer

significantly different from 0. More generally, in cases where there are multiple
mediators, mediation is studied applying the types of considerations above to each
mediator in themodel.

Judd and Kenny (1981a) argued that if randomization is not used to assign
subjects to the treatment or control group, the above coefficients should not be inter
preted as effects, unless covariates are included to adjust for selection into treatment
groups. However, because it is not possible to know in an observational study
whether the adjustments made are adequate, randomized studies are preferred. The
most

common

type of randomized study is the "completely randomized" experi
(Rosenbaum, 2002), in which subjects are assigned at random to a treatment
or control group. This is the case studied in this article; however, the analysis herein
is easily extended to the case of a randomized block experiment and the case of an

ment

observational study where it is necessary to adjust for covariates.
In using structural equation models with data from randomized experiments
to study mediation, many researchers assume that randomization enables esti
mates of model parameters to be given a causal interpretation. Building on
Rubin's model for causal inference (Rubin, 1974, 1977, 1978, 1980), Holland
(1988) argued that this is incorrect. As an example, he constructed a linear
causal model for a hypothetical randomized encouragement design with a binary
treatment variable Z indexing whether a subject is encouraged or not to study, a
continuous mediator M (amount of time studied), and a continuous outcome Y
and he compared the parameters of the causal
(subject's test performance),
model (superscripted with a c) to the corresponding parameters of the structural
equation model depicted in Figure 1. By virtue of randomization, the effect yj

variable (IV) estimand (the effect of Z on Y divided by the effect of Z onM).
Whereas Holland's
(1988) work demonstrates that the routine application of
structural equation modeling may lead to causal inferences that are not valid, his
results on the IV estimand are of very limited practical value. First, the assumption
that all the effects are the same for all subjects is implausible in studies with human
subjects. (Imbens & Angrist, 1994, and Angrist, Imbens, & Rubin, 1996, relaxed
this assumption for a binary mediator, and Angrist & Imbens, 1995, considered the
case of a discrete metrical mediator.) Second, Holland did not give conditions
under which the "direct effects" in structural equation models could be endowed,
as in the existing literature on mediation, with a causal interpretation. Understand
ing these conditions is important to any researcher who is contemplating the use of
these models

to study mediated

effects.

Identification

of Causal Parameters

This article examines the identifiability of mediating effects using structural
equation models and IV methods. Using potential outcomes, in Section 2,1 con
struct a linear causal model analogous to the recursive linear structural equation
model in Figure 1. Theorem 1 compares the parameters of the causal model with
the analogous parameters of the structural equation model, giving sufficient con
ditions for structural equation models to yield valid inferences about the effects
of mediators on outcomes. This allows researchers to ask if such conditions are
substantively

plausible

in particular applications.

Section 3 compares

the IV esti

on the outcome with the "direct effect"
?^
on the outcome in the structural equation model. The assump
tions used by Holland (1988) to justify interpreting the IV estimand as the effect
of M on y are neither stronger nor weaker than the assumptions in Theorem 1.
Thus, it is possible for the parameters of a structural equation model to warrant a

of the mediator

causal interpretation when the IV estimand does not. Next, Iweaken the identify
ing assumptions used by Holland and give alternative and more plausible condi
tions under which the IV estimand identifies the effect of the mediator on the
outcome. Importantly (when an "exclusion restriction" also holds), these condi
tions are weaker

than those needed to identify mediated effects using
equation models. Section 4 presents a brief example illustrating the
addition, the case where these conditions do not hold is studied. The

group may not attend the workshops, as in Jo (2002a, 2002b) and Little and Yau
(1998), the distinction between treatment assignment and treatment received
can be quite important. While the effects of treatment assignment considered in
Sections 2 and 3 are clearly still of interest (as they provide information about
the effectiveness of the entire treatment package), an investigator typically wants
to also know the effects of treatment itself. Identifying these effects is a difficult
problem, as the treatment received is self-selected. Section 5 extends the analysis
to this case, thereby incorporating into a more general framework some of the
recent statistical work on compliance (e.g., Angrist et al., 1996). Section 6 con
tains a brief discussion of the case where there are multiple mediators,
and
Section 7 concludes.

In Section 2.1, I define mediated and unmediated effects, both at the indivi
dual and population levels. A linear causal model is constructed for comparison
with the linear recursive structural equation models
featured in the literature
on mediation and discussed in Section 2.2. Unlike the parameters of the linear
the structural equation parameters are identifiable from the
causal model,

Let Z denote the treatment group to which a subject is assigned (Z= 1 if
assigned to the treatment group, 0 otherwise), and letM and Y denote, respec
tively, a continuous mediator and a continuous outcome. The case where the
treatment is targeted at several mediators
that may affect the outcome is dis
in Section 6.
For each subject / in a population P, let the random variable Af/(0) denote fs
value on the mediator when assigned to the control group; similarly, let Af,-(1)
denote the value when i is assigned to the treatment group. The pair (M,-(0),

the response of unit i depends only on the treatment assigned to / and not the
treatment to which any other unit is assigned. Rubin (1980) called this the stable
unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA), and it ismade throughout this article.
For unit i, the causal effects of Z on M and Y, respectively, are:

(1988) referred to this as an "additivity" assumption; Robins (2003)
and Ten Have, Elliot, Joffe, Zanutto, and Datto (2004), among others, also con
sidered this assumption.
It is important to realize that the additivity assumption is not innocuous and
empirical researchers who wish to conduct mediational analyses should attempt to

Holland

address the reasonableness of this assumption before proceeding further. Unfortu
nately, unlike the case where Y is regressed on Z andM, assumption 6 (equation 6)
is not testable. One instance where the additivity assumption holds iswhen the treat
ment does not have any effect on the outcome except through themediator, namely,
the unmediated effect is 0. This is the so-called exclusion restriction (subsequently
discussed), and it is likely to hold in a double-blinded study.
Under additivity, the average unmediated effect of Z on Y can be written as

Although it is possible to separate the average effect of Z on Y into mediated

M on y requires imposing additional structure. Following the conventional litera

in which linear structural equation models are used to express
the mediated effect as the product of the effect of Z on M with the effect of M on

Although
equation 25 relaxes both the assumption of constant

whether the conditions in Theorem 5 are plausible in empirical work. Theorem 7
gives a sufficient condition for equation 25 to hold. Although stronger than the
condition in equation 25, this condition is important because it is easy to think
about substantively and it also represents themost plausible way in which the con

Finally, the need for the assumption in equation 25 stems from the
the causal linear regression (equation 10) to separate the average mediated effect
of Z on y into components. Of course other parametric forms might be used, but
it would still be necessary to make the assumption in equation 25 or something
similar. When such assumptions are not plausible, it is still possible to conduct a
mediational
analysis. Theorem 8 takes a somewhat different tack, giving useful
sufficient conditions for nonparametrically identifying the average mediated effect:

Though simple, Theorem 8 is very important. The identification conditions in
Theorem 5, while weaker than those in previous research, are considerably
stronger than those in Theorem 8. Under the hypotheses in Theorem 8, it is still
possible to answer two important questions of interest in a mediational analysis:
(a) Does the treatment package affect the mediator, and (b) what is the value of
the mediated effect? The first question is answered by considering the (identi
the average
fied) effect of Z on M. The second is answered by considering
mediated effect.
4. Example
I use the hypothetical encouragement
study considered by Holland (1988) to
numerically compare the structural equation parameters of Section 2.2 with the
causal parameters of Section 2.1 when the latter are identified using the IV esti

estimand, it is incorrectly assumed that y?>
0, the IV estimand 18/3 is biased.
It is also worth noting that conclusions
identical to those previously men
tioned are reached in the case where Holland's
(1988) assumption of constant
effects holds. That is because the weaker assumption in equation 25 is sufficient
for the decomposition
in Theorem 4 to hold. Thus, Holland's
assumptions are
not considered further.
Now suppose instead that the assumptions in Theorem 5 justifying the use of
the IV estimand hold but that the ignorability assumption (equation 20) does not.

In thiscase, y{2]= 0 and ?^c)= 6, whereas ?^}= ???- y^/y?^ =6-3/3

= 5.

The general case where the assumptions in Theorem 5 fail is also easy to con
sider. If equation 25 does not hold, neither does equation 20. The bias

(equation 32) is potentially very informative. The former measures the overall suc
cess of the treatment package in affecting the mediator. It depends on the substan
tive content of the package and the compliance rate. If the LATE is substantial, but
the ITT is not, and the investigator thinks the effect of the treatment package on
themediator for the noncompliers is also substantial, this suggests the need to rede
sign the treatment package to increase compliance, as opposed to redesigning the
substantive content of the package.

sisting of compliers; if this is small and the average causal effects for compliers and
noncompliers are not equal, the study results may be of limited utility for making
policy. On the other hand, if the compliers represent themajority of the population,
the results will be of greater policy relevance (even if the complier and non
complier effects are not equal).
Finally, when subjects assigned to the control group cannot take up treatment,
the compliers consist of all the treated subjects. In this case, the complier effects

information must be incorporated into the problem. One way to identify both
parameters is to add an additional treatment group in order to pick up a second
instrument (Genetian, Morris, Johannes, & Bloom, 2005). For example, in the
first treatment group, the intervention might be targeted only at M and in the
second treatment group, the intervention might be targeted at both M and P.
the effect of M can be ascertained by comparing

6. Discussion
This article examines conditions under which structural equation models and
instrumental variable methods can be used to identify causal effects of a mediat
ing variable on an outcome. Even in a randomized experiment, the coefficient
on the mediating variable in a structural equation model does not identify a cau
sal parameter, unless additional and often implausible assumptions, explicated
herein, are made. Instrumental variable methods are considered and conditions
under which the IV estimand identifies the average effect of the mediator are
given. The critical assumption (equation 25) that is needed to identify the effect
unit effects is weaker
of the mediator using IV in models with heterogeneous
than the assumption (equation 20) that is needed to identify this effect using
literature on
structural equation models. Section 5 synthesizes the psychological
mediation and recent statistical and econometric literature on compliance, show
ing that the IV estimand in equation 40 identifies
to a one unit increase in the mediator.
In this article, potential outcomes of the form
were considered. Some authors argue that such

made only within latent subclasses defined jointly by values of M (0) and M (I).
An extensive discussion of the relative merits of these two approaches tomedia
tion is beyond the scope of this article. The position taken herein is that both can
be useful, as evidenced by Section 5, in which the two approaches are blended.
The extension of the results for a single mediator to the case of multiple med
iators was also considered. The results in this article also extend readily to the
case where the mediator and/or outcome variables are latent. In observational
studies or conditionally randomized experiments where the ignorability assump
tion (equation 18) holds after conditioning on pretreatment covariates, the pre
results also hold after conditioning
on these covariates.
In this case,
effects that are conditional on the values of the covariates are obtained, and
averaging over the distribution of the covariates then gives back the average
vious

effects. Kraemer, Wilson,
Fairburn, and Agras (2002) called such covariates
moderators. Even in a randomized study, a researcher will often want to know
how the effects of interest are moderated.
Following Angrist et al. (1996), the exclusion restrictions herein were assumed
to hold for all subjects. Jo (2002a, 2002b) weakened
this assumption and also
showed how covariate information may be used in a different way to identify
average effects of treatment assignment Z in the subpopulation of compliers.
