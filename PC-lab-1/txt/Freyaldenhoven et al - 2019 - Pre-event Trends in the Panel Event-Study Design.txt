Pre-Event Trends in the Panel Event-Study Design†
By Simon Freyaldenhoven, Christian Hansen, and Jesse M. Shapiro*
We consider a linear panel event-study design in which unobserved
confounds may be related both to the outcome and to the policy variable of interest. We provide sufficient conditions to identify the causal
effect of the policy by exploiting covariates related to the policy only
through the confounds. Our model implies a set of moment equations
that are linear in parameters. The effect of the policy can be estimated by 2SLS, and causal inference is valid even when endogeneity
leads to pre-event trends (“pre-trends”) in the outcome. Alternative
approaches perform poorly in our simulations. (JEL C23, C26)
We are interested in estimating the causal effect β
​ ​of a policy variable ​z​ i​t​​​on an
outcome ​​yi​t​​​in a linear panel data model, where i​​indexes units and t​​indexes time.
We are concerned that the strict exogeneity of ​z​ i​t​​​may fail due to the presence of
a time-varying unobservable ​η​ ​it​​​that is correlated with both ​z​i​t​​​and ​​yi​t​​​. In the literature on the effects of the minimum wage, ​​yi​t​​​is youth employment, ​i​ indexes
states, ​t​indexes calendar years, and ​​z​it​​​is an indicator for years after passage of a
minimum-wage increase. The unobserved confound ​η​ i​t​​​is labor demand. The concern is that states tend to pass minimum-wage increases during good economic
times (Card and Krueger 1995, Neumark and Wascher 2007).
A common diagnostic approach in such settings is to look at whether the policy
change appears to have an effect on the outcome before it actually occurs.1 The
presence of such pre-event trends, or “pre-trends,” is taken as evidence against the
strict exogeneity of the policy change.
To us, this approach seems incomplete. If pre-trends are not detected, it may be
either that there are no pre-trends or that pre-trends are present but undetected due to

Of the 16 papers in the 2016 American Economic Review that use a linear panel data model, 11 are concerned
with the existence of pre-trends as a sign of endogeneity. Of these 11, 9 include a plot of pre-trends, of which 2
provide a formal test of whether pre-trends are zero. In the minimum wage context, Allegretto, Dube, and Reich
(2011) provide a plot of pre-trends.

limited statistical power. In the latter case, estimation under the assumption of strict
exogeneity is typically inappropriate. If pre-trends are detected, it is understood that
strict exogeneity is likely to fail, but it is not clear what to do.
In both cases, what is needed is a notion of magnitude: given some pre-trend in
the outcome, how much of the apparent effect of the policy is due to confounds, and
how much to the causal effect of the policy? Armed with such a notion, a researcher
can conduct valid inference on ​β​whether or not pre-trends are detected.
In this paper, we propose to obtain such a notion from the behavior of a covariate ​​xi​t​​​that is affected by the confound ​η​ ​it​​​but not by the policy ​​z​it​​​. In the minimum
wage context, adult employment ​x​ ​it​​​responds to labor demand ​​ηit​ ​​​but plausibly not to
the minimum wage (Brown 1999). Instead of using adult employment as a control
variable, as is commonly done in the literature,2 we propose to look at its dynamics
around minimum wage increases and use these to infer the dynamics of ​η​ i​t​​​.
To fix ideas, suppose we observe the outcome ​​yi​t​​​in periods ​t = 1, …  , T​and the

equal 0, then the confound does not affect the outcome, and identification of ​β​ is

“event-study estimates” (Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2009; Duggan, Garthwaite,
and Goyal 2016).
Panel A shows a clear pre-trend in the outcome, indicating that ​γ ≠ 0​. Panel B
shows that the covariate ​​xi​t​​​exhibits a pre-trend similar to that of the outcome, and
a relatively smaller increase at the event time. We would like to use the covariate ​​xi​t​​​
to correct for the role of the confound ​η​ i​t​​​. Including the covariate ​x​ it​ ​​​as a control
variable will suffice only if ​x​ ​it​​​is a perfect proxy for ​η​ ​it​​​ (i.e., ​x​ it​ ​​  = λ​ηit​ ​​​). Subtracting

Notes: An unobserved factor potentially causes endogeneity, manifested as a pre-trend in the outcome ​y​ i​t​​. A covariate ​x​ i​t​​affected by the confound, but not by the policy, permits us to learn the dynamics of the confound and adjust
for them. Depicted are regression coefficients on indicators for time relative to policy change. Solid lines depict the

covariate (i.e., ​γ = λ​). Extrapolating a trend in the outcome will be suitable only if
the post-event behavior of the confound ​​ηi​t​​​can be inferred from its pre-event trend.
The alternative that we propose can be understood with reference to panel C of
Figure 1. Here, we rescale the series in panel B so that it exactly matches that in
panel A in the two periods immediately before the event. Under our maintained
assumptions, comparing the two series in panel C allows us to decompose the
change in the outcome at the event time into a component due to the causal effect
of the policy and a component due to the confound ​​η​it​​​. The adjusted plot in panel D
removes the estimated effect of the pre-trend from panel A, revealing the dynamics
of the outcome net of the confound, and hence β
​ ​, the causal effect of interest.
The geometry of these plots suggests an instrumental variables setup, in which
panel A of Figure 1 plots the reduced form for the outcome and panel B plots the first
stage. Indeed, we show that ​β​can be estimated by two-stage least squares (2SLS)
regression of the outcome ​​y​it​​​on the policy ​​z​it​​​and covariate ​x​ ​it​​​, with leads (e.g., ​​z​i,t+1​​​)
of the policy serving as excluded instruments. An essential assumption is that the
dynamic relationship of ​​xi​t​​​to ​​zit​ ​​​mirrors the dynamic relationship of ​η​ ​it​​​to ​​zit​ ​​​. This
means, in particular, that ​​x​it​​​is affected by ​η​ it​ ​​​but not by ​​zit​ ​​​.
We also require that there be a pre-trend in the covariate ​​xi​t​​​. We argue that a pretrend in ​η​ i​t​​​is natural in the many economic settings in which the policy ​z​ ​it​​​ changes
when some unobserved state variable ​​η​it​​​crosses a threshold. Indeed, the common

approach of using pre-trends to diagnose failures of exogeneity is presumably
­motivated, in part, by the belief that the confound ​​ηi​t​​​is likely to exhibit a pre-trend.
Our assumptions imply that a pre-trend in ​​ηi​t​​​manifests as a pre-trend in the covariate ​x​ i​t​​​, and may or may not manifest as a pre-trend in the outcome ​y​ it​ ​​​.
Section I generalizes the setup in (1)–(3) to allow for multiple confounds, additive unit-specific fixed effects, and exogenous controls. We show that the model
admits a generalized method of moments (GMM) representation, from which standard results on estimation and inference (with large N
​ ​and fixed ​T​) are available.
Section II presents Monte Carlo evidence on the finite-sample performance of our
proposed estimator under a range of alternative data-generating processes, varying
both the quality of the proxy ​​xi​t​​​and the strength of identification. We find that, when
strongly identified, our estimator outperforms the approach of controlling directly
for ​​xi​t​​​, except when ​​xi​t​​​is a nearly perfect proxy for ​η​ ​it​​​. We further find that our estimator outperforms the approach of extrapolating a linear trend from the pre-event
period and the approach of conducting a test for pre-trends before proceeding with
estimation.
The main requirement that our approach imposes on a practitioner is to find a covariate ​x​ i​t​​​that is related to the confound ​​ηi​t​​​but unaffected by the policy ​​zi​t​​​. This is similar
in difficulty to finding a suitable control variable, but without the additional burden of
ensuring that ​​x​it​​​proxies perfectly for ​​η​it​​​. (Of course, as our simulations reinforce, ​​x​it​​​
must still provide a reasonable signal of ​η​ i​t​​​in order to permit strong identification.)
The choice of covariate should be guided by economic reasoning about the nature
of the confound. In most applications we expect the number of plausible candidate
covariates to be small, and we expect that our approach will work best when a small
number of economic factors capture the important sources of endogeneity.
Section III presents applications of our proposed approach to the effect of SNAP
on household spending (Hastings and Shapiro 2018), the effect of newspaper entry
on voter turnout (Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Sinkinson 2011), and the effect of the minimum wage on youth employment (Neumark, Salas, and Wascher 2014; Allegretto
et al. 2017). These applications illustrate a range of possibilities, including situations
with clear pre-trends in the outcome, a situation without meaningful pre-trends, and
a situation in which it is hard to tell. In some cases our proposed adjustment makes
a small difference to point estimates, in some cases a larger difference, and in some
cases it simply implies greater statistical uncertainty.
Section IV extends our model to cover the case of estimating a dynamic treatment effect and discusses issues of model testing and instrument selection when the
model is overidentified.
We are not aware of an existing formal proposal to use an unaffected covariate
to adjust causal inference for pre-trends in a panel data model. In their Appendix,
Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Sinkinson (2011) implement an estimator that is similar
in spirit to the one that we propose, but that is not formally justified by our setup.3
Borusyak and Jaravel (2017) study the identification and estimation of pre-trends in
a dynamic panel data model. Roth (2018) studies the bias introduced by pre-testing

Specification (6) of Table B1 in Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Sinkinson (2011) uses a dynamic first stage analogous to panel B of Figure 1, and a static second stage analogous to (1). Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Sinkinson (2011,
footnote 5) justify this estimator informally.

for pre-trends and shows how to correct for it.4 Neither paper considers the use of
covariates to address endogeneity, as we do here.
Our framework is closely related to classical work on models with measurement error and on panel data models with strict exogeneity.5 Replacement of ​​η​it​​​
with ​​x​it​​​produces a factor model or measurement error model (Aigner et al. 1984).
A large literature, partially reviewed in Abbring and Heckman (2007), Heckman
and Vytlacil (2007), and Matzkin (2007), shows how to establish identification in
such models, typically by imposing covariance restrictions across equations governing multiple imperfect measurements of the latent factor. Instead, we impose strict
exogeneity of the policy variable ​z​ ​it​​​with respect to the measurement error in ​x​ ​it​​​ to
achieve identification using only a single covariate.
There are other ways to address policy endogeneity in linear panel data models
like (1). One is to find an instrument for policy changes (Besley and Case 2000).
This is an appealing approach when feasible, but such instruments are not readily
available in many settings. Our approach replaces the requirement of an instrument
that impacts the policy but not the outcome with the requirement of a covariate
that is related to the confound but unaffected by the policy. Another approach is to
impose dynamic restrictions on the relationship between ​x​ ​it​​​and ​​ηi​t​​​. In a panel datasetting with mismeasured regressors, Griliches and Hausman (1986) propose to use
lags of ​​xi​t​​​to construct valid instruments for ​​xi​t​​​. This approach requires either that
the measurement errors are serially uncorrelated or that the correlation structure of
the measurement error is known (Wansbeek 2001; Xiao, Shao, and Palta 2010). Our
approach allows for arbitrary correlation in the measurement errors, but requires that
the policy be strictly exogenous with respect to these errors. Yet another approach is
to try to recover the time-series properties of ​η​ ​it​​​. Ashenfelter and Card (1985) estimate a model of the outcome ​y​ i​t​​​on data from a set of units unaffected by the policy,
and use the estimated model to construct a counterfactual for the units affected by
the policy under maintained assumptions about the determinants of the timing of
policy change (see also Heckman and Robb 1985).
Another alternative approach to estimating policy effects in event-study settings
are synthetic control methods (Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller 2010). These
methods have been designed for settings with a small number of treated units,
whereas our asymptotics are based on a large number of treated units. This makes
direct formal comparison difficult. Intuitively, as synthetic control methods rely on
using pre-event observable data to construct a counterfactual trend in the absence
of the policy, conditions for valid inference tend to involve a form of exogeneity
of treatment conditional on the observables used to construct the counterfactual
(e.g., Chernozhukov, Wüthrich, and Zhu 2017; Ferman and Pinto 2017; Li 2017).
Our approach instead allows for a latent trend that cannot be directly captured with
observables, at the cost of additional economic structure.

4
See also Kahn-Lang and Lang (forthcoming). More broadly, our recommendation to account for endogeneity
in estimation, rather than pre-testing for it, is in line with the large statistics and econometrics literature regarding
the use of pre-tests for model/specification choice. Guggenberger (2010), in particular, makes a very similar argument in the context of choosing between ordinary least squares (OLS) or instrumental variables (IV) estimation.

covariates to allow for unobservable confounds.

data matrices as residuals from the projection of the remaining variables onto the
exogenous variables. Second, we remove the fixed effects. Let ​​k​ ̃ ​​it​​  = ​k​it​​  − ​ _T1 ​ ​∑ Ts=1​​  kis​ ​​​​

the outcome is homogeneous across units i​​. A recent literature explores properties (and failures) of the two-way fixed effects estimator under heterogeneous
causal effects (Abraham and Sun 2018, Athey and Imbens 2018, de Chaisemartin

B. Identifying Assumptions
We now state two assumptions that suffice to identify ​β​.
ASSUMPTION 1 (Orthogonality Conditions): There exists a set of nonnegative
integers 
​ = ​
{0, 1, …  , L}​​such that
(i) ​E[​​​z̃ ​​i,t+l​​ ​​ε̃ ​​it​​]​  = 0, ∀l ∈ ​.

(ii) ​E​[​​z̃ ​​i,t+l​​ ​​ũ ​​it​​]​  = 0, ∀l ∈ ​.

ASSUMPTION 2 (Rank Conditions): Let ​​w​it​​  = ​​(​​z̃ ​​it​​, ​​z̃ ​​i,t+1​​, … , ​​z̃ ​​i,t+L​​)′​   ​​and define a
matrix ​H​ as ​H = E​(​wi​t​​​[​​z̃ ​​it​​, ​​x̃ ​​  ′i ​t]​  ​)​​. Then,
(i)	​rank​(Λ)​  = R​.

(ii)	​rank​(H)​ = ​(R + 1)​​.
Assumptions 1 and 2 are analogous, respectively, to the exclusion and relevance
conditions in a linear instrumental variables setup. Strict exogeneity of ​​zi​t​​​ in (4),
as is commonly assumed in panel event studies, implies Assumption 1(i), which
allows ​​z​̃ ​​it​​​and its leads to be correlated with ​​y​̃ ​​it​​​only through ​​η​̃ ​​it​​​or through the
causal effect of the policy. Strict exogeneity of ​z​ ​it​​​in the first-stage relationship (5)
implies Assumption 1(ii), which allows ​​z​ ̃ ​​it​​​and its leads to be correlated with ​​x​ ̃ ​​it​​​ only
through ​​η​ ̃ ​​it​​​. Strict exogeneity thus rules out a causal effect of the policy ​​zi​t​​​on the
covariate ​x​ i​t​​​and any correlation between the policy ​z​ ​it​​​and the measurement error ​u​ ​it​​​.
We do not require the orthogonality of ​​ε​ ̃ ​​it​​​and ​​​ũ ​​it​​​, and thus the covariates ​x​ ​it​​​may be
correlated with the outcome ​​yi​t​​​through channels other than the confound ​​ηi​t​​​.
Assumption 2(i) imposes that the covariates ​x​ i​t​​​contain information about all
of the latent factors ​η​ ​it​​​. Assumption 2(ii) is the equivalent of the usual instrumental variables relevance assumption and can in principle be checked in the data. It
requires a nonzero correlation between the noisy proxy ​​xi​t​​​and leads of ​​zi​t​​​, i.e., a
​ = 0​, our assumptions do
pre-trend in ​x​ i​t​​​. On the other hand, because we allow for γ
not imply a pre-trend in ​y​ i​t​​​.

REMARK 3: If ​rank​(E​(​wit​ ​​​[​​z̃ ​​it​​, ​​η̃ ​​  ′it ​]​  ​)​)​ = ​(R + 1)​​, then Assumption 2(ii) follows from
Assumption 1, Assumption 2(i), and (7). That is, a pre-trend in the confound implies
a pre-trend in the covariate.

REMARK 4: Suppose that ​z​​it​​  = 1​({​ ∃ ​t​​  ⁎​  ≤ t  : ​ηi​​t​​  ⁎​​​  > ​η​​  ⁎}​)​ ​​: the policy ​​zit​ ​​​ changes
when ​​ηi​t​​​crosses some threshold ​η​ ​​  ⁎​​. Then, Assumption 2(ii) will hold for a wide
range of processes. Intuitively, if ​η​ i​t​​​is autocorrelated, a threshold crossing at time​
t + 1​provides a signal that the latent ​η​ ​it​​​was already large (close to the threshold)
in the previous period. Economic settings covered by this case include:
• Means-tested program. We are interested in the effect of a household’s participation ​​zi​t​​​ in a means-tested program on some outcome ​y​ it​ ​​​ as in Hastings

3314

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

and Shapiro (2018). Each household ​i​becomes eligible for the program when
the gap ​​ηi​t​​​between the household’s income and a poverty line exceeds a threshold ​​η​​  ⁎​​. This setting is closely related to that in Ashenfelter (1978), who found
that an individual’s earnings tend to decline prior to the individual’s entry into
a job training program.
• Firm entry. We are interested in the effect of firm entry into a market on some
outcome ​​y​it​​​as in Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Sinkinson (2011). At any given time t​​,
a single potential entrant can pay a one-time cost to enter market ​i​ and earn
a stream of cash flows whose expected present discounted value is ​η​ ​it​​​. Under
appropriate assumptions on ​η​ ​it​​​(for example, that it evolves as a random walk
with i.i.d. innovations), the firm enters the first time that ​η​ i​t​​​ exceeds a threshold ​​η​​  ⁎​​ (McDonald and Siegel 1986, Dixit and Pindyck 1994). The policy ​​zi​t​​​ is
an indicator for the presence of a firm in the market.
• State law change. We are interested in the effect of the passage of a law on some
outcome ​​y​it​​​. A given state ​i​passes the law when the underlying strength ​​η​it​​​of its
economy exceeds some threshold ​​η​​  ⁎​​. The policy ​​z​it​​​ is an indicator for periods
following passage of the law.
REMARK 5: It is also useful to consider examples of economic settings in which
Assumption 2 will fail. These include:
• Randomized controlled trial. Suppose that the policy ​​zi​t​​​ is randomly assigned
and therefore statistically independent of all unobservables. Then there is no
pre-trend in the confound, and we would expect Assumption 2(ii) to fail.
• Poor covariate. Suppose that the covariate ​x​ ​it​​​ is unrelated to the confound ​η​ ​it​​​.
Then ​Λ = 0​ and Assumption 2(i) fails. A related issue is that if ​Λ​ is nearly
rank-deficient, then the model is only weakly identified. We illustrate these
issues in simulations in Section II.
REMARK 6: In order to keep notation and statements simple, we treat ​​zi​t​​​as univariate. It is straightforward to allow the dimension of ​z​ ​it​​​to be greater than 1. We allow
for ​R > 1​throughout. We note, however, that the rank condition in Assumption
2(ii) is likely to become increasingly demanding as R
​ ​grows, and in our simulations
and applications we consider only cases with R
​ = 1​. A model with R
​ = 1​ may
be thought of as an approximation to a model with ​R > 1​in which the different
suspected confounds have similar dynamics around the event time. In this sense, we
think our proposed approach will be most useful in settings in which the confound
can be well approximated by a small number of economic factors.

where (9) follows from (6) and (7) given the definition of ​​Γ̃ ​​. Now from Assumption 1,
(10)

​E​[​wit​ ​​ ​​ṽ ​​it​​]​  = 0.​

Assumption 2(ii) guarantees that the moment conditions in (10) are sufficient to
identify β
​ ​ (and, incidentally, ​​Γ̃ ​​).
Estimation may proceed by GMM using the sample analogues of (10) as moment
conditions. For the case where T
​ ​is fixed and N
​ ​grows large, estimation and inference
results are available under standard regularity conditions (Newey and McFadden
1994).
One convenient estimator justified by (10) is a 2SLS regression of ​​​ỹ ​​it​​​on ​​​z̃ ​​it​​​
and ​​x​ ̃ ​​it​​​, treating the covariates ​​​x̃ ​​it​​​as mismeasured regressors and the leads of ​​z​ ̃ ​​it​​​ as
the excluded instruments.7 We will use this 2SLS estimator in our simulations and
applications.
REMARK 7: In principle, any functions of the leads of the event, ​​​z̃ ​​i,t+l​​​, ​l ∈ ​, are
valid instruments. In practice, we expect that ​T​will often be moderately sized, and
that the closest leads will be most informative. As a default, we therefore suggest
choosing the ​R​closest leads of ​​​z̃ ​​it​​​as instruments, which results in an exactly identified model. This is in line with the way we implement our estimator in both our
simulations and applications. We discuss issues of overidentification and instrument
selection in Section IVB.
REMARK 8: Suppose that we observe ​​​ỹ ​​it​​​and ​​z​ ̃ ​​it​​​in one sample and ​​x​ ̃ ​​it​​​and ​​z​ ̃ ​​it​​​ in
another. Then we may proceed with two-sample instrumental variables estimation
(Angrist and Krueger 1992, Inoue and Solon 2010) using the leads of ​​​z̃ ​​it​​​as instruments for ​​x​ ̃ ​​it​​​.
REMARK 9: If, in a given economic setting, we are concerned about failures of the
exclusion restrictions in Assumption 1, we may apply existing approaches to adjust
inference for plausible violations of moment conditions (e.g., Conley, Hansen,
and Rossi 2012; Andrews, Gentzkow, and Shapiro 2017). Because Assumption 1(i)
follows from the common assumption of strict exogeneity, we expect that in most
cases Assumption 1(ii) will be the more controversial component of Assumption 1.
In Section III, we discuss the economic content of Assumption 1(ii) in the context of
our applications.
II. Simulations

This section presents results from Monte Carlo simulations. These allow us
to compare the performance of alternative estimators and to assess the adequacy

7
For example, in the case where ​
R = K = L = 1​
, this approach is equivalent to estimating a linear
instrumental variables model with structural equation ​y​ ̃​it​ = β ​z̃it​ ​+ ​Γ̃ ​x̃​it​+ ​ṽ​it​​and corresponding first-stage equax
tion ​​x̃​it​ = ​π​0​​z̃it​ ​+ ​π​1​​z̃i,t+1

of standard asymptotic approximations of the finite-sample distributions of our
estimator.
A. Data-Generating Processes and Estimators
DEFINITION 1 (Data-Generating Processes): Throughout this section, we consider
the following data-generating processes (DGPs):
​ ​​  + ​ζ​it​​​, where ​​ζit​ ​​  ∼ N​(0, ​σ​  2ζ​  ​)​​are i.i.d. across i​​and ​t​.
• ​​ηi​t​​  = ρ ​ηi,t−1
• ​​z​it​​  = 𝟏​(​{∃ ​t​​  ⁎​  ≤ t : ​ηi​​t​​  ⁎​​ ​ > ​η​​  ⁎​}​)​​, where ​​η​​  ⁎​​is chosen so that the average number
of events is approximately constant across different values of the simulation
parameters.8
• ​K = 1​and

(11)

​​x​it​​  = λ ​ηi​t​​  + ​u​it​​,​

(12)

​​yi​t​​  = β ​zi​t​​  + 0.25​η​it​​  + 0.2t + ​α​i​​  + ​ε​it​​,​

  where ​​ui​t​​  ∼ N​(0, ​σ​  2u)​​  ​​are i.i.d. across ​i​and ​t​.
• The outcome is generated by

  where ​β = 1​, ​​αi​​​  ∼ N​(0, 1)​​are i.i.d. across i​​, ​​εi​t​​  ∼ N​(0, 1)​​are i.i.d. across i​​
and ​t​, and ​α
​ i​​​​and ​​εi​t​​​are independent for all ​i​and ​t​.

All of the simulations are based on the DGPs specified in Definition 1. Section IIB
​ ​  2u​ ​  = 4​.
presents benchmark results for a design with λ
​ = ρ = 1​, ​​σ​  2ζ​  ​  = 1​, and ​σ
We initialize ​​η​it​​​with ​​η​i1​​  = 0​and generate 2​ 0​time-series observations for each i​​.
We then use the ​10​time periods ​t ∈ ​{6, 7, … , 15}​​as the sample for estimation.
Section IIC presents more extensive results for a variety of designs with
​ ​  2ζ​  ​​and ​σ
​ ​  2u​​​  such that v​ ar​(​​η̃ ​​it)​​ ​  = 1​ and ​var​(​​x̃ ​​it)​​ ​  = 2​.
​ρ ∈ ​[0, 1)​​. For these, we choose ​σ
To simulate these designs, we generate 20 time-series observations for each of 1​ ,000​
cross-sectional units ​i​. We initialize ​​ηi​,−19​​​as i.i.d. draws from a standard normal
distribution and use the initial 20 observations t​ = − 19, − 18,  …  , 0​as burn-in.
We then keep an estimation sample of 10 time-series observations consisting of the
­periods ​t = 6, 7,  …  , 15​, retaining the full history of ​​zi​t​​​so that we can construct
leads and lags. Applying this procedure leaves us with ​T = 10​time-series observations on N
​ = 1,000​units, of which approximately ​200​experience an event.9 As
online Appendix Figure 3 illustrates, these designs feature a mean-reverting confound as in, for example, Ashenfelter (1978).

8
Specifically, ​​η​*​ = 𝟏​(ρ ≤ 0.8)​(1.96 + 0.2ρ)​+ 𝟏​(ρ = 0.9)​1.85 + 𝟏​(ρ = 1)​4​. Online Appendix Figure 1
shows how the performance of our estimator changes in a specification where ​z​ i​t​​is determined by ​η​ ​it​​and an additional noise variable that allows us to vary the importance of ​​η​it​​in determining ​​zi​t​​.
9
Online Appendix Figure 2 shows the mean number of cross-sectional observations in which an event occurs
across the design space considered in the stationary case. Within each set of simulation parameters, at least 99.4
percent of draws have between 160 and 240 units with an event. We include in our analysis all cross-sectional units,
including those in which an event does not occur (Borusyak and Jaravel 2017).

To vary the strength of identification, we will consider different values of ​ρ​ in​​

[0, 0.9]​​. As ​ρ​increases, our instruments, the leads of ​​z​it​​​, will become stronger, result-

ing in better identification. On the other hand, as the autocorrelation in ​​ηi​t​​​ approaches
zero, we lose identification. Within this design, stronger persistence in ​η​ i​t​​​will tend
to exacerbate the bias that arises from failing to account for ​​ηi​t​​​.
To vary the quality of ​​x​it​​​as a proxy for ​​η​it​​​, we vary ​λ​to control the population ​​R​​  2​​
from the infeasible regression of ​​xi​t​​​on ​​ηit​ ​​​ in (11). When this ​​R​​  2​​equals 1, ​​xit​ ​​​ is
​ ​​  2​​ approaches
a perfect proxy, and the best possible control for ​η​ i​t​​​is ​x​ ​it​​​. As this ​R
0, the proxy ​x​ i​t​​​provides no signal about the latent variable ​η​ ​it​​​, and identification
fails.
We consider five different feasible estimators for the policy effect ​β​and its
dynamic counterparts, and include individual and time fixed effects in all specifications. The first estimator we consider ignores ​​η​it​​​entirely and simply regresses the
outcome ​​yi​t​​​on the event indicator ​​zi​t​​​ ( failing to control for ​​ηi​t​​​). The second estimator
uses ​​x​it​​​as a proxy for ​η​ ​it​​​and corresponds to the regression of the outcome ​y​ ​it​​​on the
event indicator ​​z​it​​​and the covariate ​x​ ​it​​​ (using ​​xi​t​​​ as proxy for ​​ηi​t​​​). The third estimator is from our proposed 2SLS regression of the outcome ​​yi​t​​​on the event indicator ​​zi​t​​​and the covariate ​x​ i​t​​​, using ​z​ ​i,t+1​​​as an excluded instrument for ​x​ i​t​​​ (2SLS—one
lead). Online Appendix Figure 4 presents corresponding results using the Bayesian
information criterion (BIC) to choose the number of first-stage leads. The fourth
estimator attempts to account for the confound by extrapolating a linear trend from
the three periods immediately preceding the event (extrapolating a linear trend).10
The last estimator that we consider formalizes the idea of testing for pre-trends
that is common in applied work ( pre-testing for pre-trend). To implement this estimator, we first compute the typical event-study estimates, normalized so that the
coefficient on ​z​ i​,t+1​​​is equal to 0. We then perform a conventional test that the coefficient on ​z​ i​,t+2​​​is equal to 0 at the 5 percent level. If we fail to reject the hypothesis,
we conclude that there is no pre-trend and proceed with the analysis as in failing
to control.11 If we reject the null, we conclude that there is a pre-trend and “give
up.” We formalize the notion of “giving up” by returning a confidence interval of​​
(− ∞, ∞)​​and no point estimate. When evaluating point estimates for this procedure,
we consider only those cases where we do not give up. Online Appendix Figure 6
summarizes the rejection frequency of the pre-test.
B. Results for a Benchmark Data-Generating Process
Figure 2 presents event-study estimates for a single realization from the
DGP with ρ
​ = 1​. Specifically, each panel of Figure 2 depicts estimates of the
10
See Dobkin et al. (2018) for a recent article using this approach and Hausman and Rapson (2018) for a discussion of related estimators. Online Appendix Figure 5 reports findings from an estimator that includes u­ nit-specific
deterministic linear trends as a control (Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan 1993).
11
We designed this implementation of the pre-test procedure to match practice in empirical research based on
our survey of the 2016 American Economic Review. For example, Bustos, Caprettini, and Ponticelli (2016) estimate
the effect of their policy variable one period in advance (equation 13, Table A6) and report that, depending on the
outcome variable, pre-trends are either not statistically different from zero or are opposite to the causal effect they
estimate (Section VB). Pierce and Schott (2016, equation (3), Figure 4, and p. 1644) report that the estimated effect
of their policy variable is statistically indistinguishable from zero in all periods prior to the policy change.

where ​​ω​t​​​are time effects, (​​ 1 − ​z​i,t+5​​)​​indicates that the event is more than five time
periods in the future, and ​z​ ​i,t−6​​​indicates the event took place more than five periods
in the past. We use the normalization that ​δ​ ​−1​​  = 0​.
Figure 2 shows both pointwise 95 percent confidence intervals and uniform
95 percent sup-t confidence bands (Olea and Plagborg-Møller 2019). Applied papers
commonly include pointwise confidence intervals in event plots.12 These permit
testing only of preselected pointwise hypotheses. Uniform bands such as those we
show here are designed to contain the true path of the coefficients 95 percent of the
time, and are therefore arguably more useful for giving readers a sense of what kinds
of pre-trends are consistent with the data.
Panel A of Figure 2 reports results from estimating (13) including ​​η​it​​​as an additional regressor. Because ​​ηi​t​​​is unobserved, this approach is infeasible, but it provides a useful benchmark of best-case performance. Point estimates of pre-event
trends are reasonably small and well-estimated. Estimates of the policy effects
(​​δ​k​​​for ​k > 0​) are reasonably close to 1, the true value.
Panel B reports estimates without any control for ​​η​it​​​and shows both strong pretrends and substantial bias in the estimated effects of the policy. Panel C reports estimates based on including the observable ​x​ ​it​​​in place of the latent variable ​η​ ​it​​​. As ​​xi​t​​​ is
a noisy measure of ​η​ ​it​​​, controlling for ​x​ ​it​​​only partially mitigates the pre-trends and
the bias in the estimated policy effects relative to panel B.
Panel D shows the event plot using our proposed 2SLS estimator to account for
the unobserved factor ​​ηi​t​​​. Specifically, we proxy for ​​η​it​​​with ​​x​it​​​and instrument for ​​xi​t​​​
with ​z​ ​i,t+1​​​.13 As expected, the proposed estimator delivers sensible estimates of pretrends and policy effects, though there is a loss of precision relative to the infeasible
benchmark in panel A. As we discuss in Section IVB, inspection of pre-trends in this
corrected plot may be thought of as a visual test of overidentification in a model with
multiple exogenous leads.
Panel E extrapolates a linear trend from the three periods immediately preceding
the event.14 Let ​​pi​t​​  = ​(t + 1)​  − min​{​t′ ​ : ​zi​​t′ ​​​  = 1}​​be the “event time” of period ​t​ for

vary across normalizations. Online Appendix Figure 7 depicts how our proposed 2SLS estimator depends on the
choice of normalization. We discuss instrument choice in Section IVB.

in the immediate post-event period, and overstates it in subsequent periods.
Panel F of Figure 2 reports estimates after pre-testing.15 As no pre-trend is
detected in this particular realization, this plot is identical to panel B.
Figure 3 shows the median and uniform confidence band for the estimates in
Figure 2 across repeated simulations from the same benchmark DGP. Figure 3 reinforces the conclusion from Figure 2 that, among the feasible estimators, only the
2SLS estimator is centered at the true value. In online Appendix Table 1, we show
the median bias, median absolute deviation, and coverage of the 95 percent confidence intervals for an estimate of the causal parameter ​β​from a static analogue
of the dynamic specifications depicted in Figure 3. The proposed 2SLS estimator
exhibits the lowest median bias and median absolute deviation among the feasible
estimators.
C. Results for a Set of Data-Generating Processes
We turn next to an exploration of the full space covered by the stationary variant
of the DGPs. We consider estimates ​​βˆ ​​ from
(15)

​​y​it​​  = β ​zi​t​​  + ​ω​t​​  + ​α​i​​  + ​η​it​​  γ + ​ε​it​​,​

where ​​ωt​ ​​​are time effects. We consider the one infeasible and five feasible estimators defined in Section IIA. Each estimator takes a different approach to addressing the confound ​​η​it​​​. In the case of the linear extrapolation estimator, we use
​​βˆ ​  = ​ _15 ​ ​∑ 0k=−4​​  ​​δˆ ​​−k​​​​, with ​​δk​ ​​​from equation (14), as an estimate for the causal effect ​β​.16
Figure 4 depicts the absolute median bias of each estimator. As expected, the
presence of the unobserved confound severely biases the estimator that completely
fails to control for ​η​ ​it​​​ (panel B). Using ​x​ ​it​​​directly to control for ​η​ i​t​​​also results in
severe bias except when the ​R
​ ​​  2​​from the infeasible regression of ​x​ i​t​​​on ​​ηi​t​​​is very
large, in which case ​x​ ​it​​​is a nearly perfect proxy for ​​η​it​​​ (panel C). Also in line with
our expectations, the median of our proposed 2SLS estimator is close to the true
value across most of the parameter space (panel D). The exceptions occur in the
regions of weak identification, where there is either little correlation between ​x​ i​t​​​
and ​​η​it​​​or little autocorrelation in ​​ηi​t​​​. Extrapolating a linear trend from the pre-event
period (panel E) produces biased estimates across the parameter space. Finally,
pre-testing for pre-trends leads to little improvement relative to no controls at all
(panel F). As online Appendix Figure 6 illustrates, even when ρ
​ = 0.9​, we reject
the null of no pre-trend in less than 30 percent of simulations, even though they are
always present in population.
Figure 5 depicts the median absolute deviation of each estimator from the true
parameter value. The sampling distributions of estimators other than our proposed
2SLS estimator are dominated by bias. Therefore, for these estimators, the plots
15
Online Appendix Figure 9 shows results from pre-testing based on the hypothesis that ​δ​ ​k​​is equal to 0 for
multiple periods preceding the event, and from pre-testing based on the hypothesis that the slope coefficient Ω
​ ​ on
event time in (14) is equal to 0.
16
Online Appendix Figure 10 shows results when we instead use ​β
​ˆ ​ = ​δˆ ​0​​as an estimate for the causal effect β

The observed coverage of the pre-test estimator (Figure 6, panel F) is a consequence of two offsetting patterns. When we reject the null of no pre-trend, coverage is necessarily equal to 1 as we conclude we cannot use the

to 0 as the estimator is severely biased.

III. Applications

In this section, we apply our proposed estimator to empirical settings corresponding to the three examples discussed in Remark 4. Together, these capture many of
the scenarios a practitioner might encounter:
• no pre-trend in the outcome variable and a clear pre-trend in the covariate
(Section IIIA);

VOL. 109 NO. 9

• a clear pre-trend in the outcome variable and a clear pre-trend in the covariate
(Section IIIA);
• an unclear pre-trend in the outcome variable and a clear pre-trend in the covariate (Section IIIB);
• an unclear pre-trend in the outcome variable and an unclear pre-trend in the
covariate (Section IIIC).
A. The Effects of SNAP Participation on Household Spending Patterns
Hastings and Shapiro (2018) study the effect of participation in the Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) on household spending in a panel eventstudy design. Here, ​i​indexes households and ​t​indexes calendar quarters. The outcome ​y​ ​it​​​is either at-home food expenditures or the share of food spending going to
store-brand items. The policy ​z​ i​t​​​is an indicator for time periods following entry into
the program. SNAP is means-tested, so households become eligible when income ​​ηi​t​​​
is sufficiently low. Past research shows that lower household income is associated
with lower at-home food expenditures (Castner and Mabli 2010) and greater storebrand share (Bronnenberg et al. 2015), so income is a potential confound. Hastings
and Shapiro (2018) have access to Rhode Island administrative data, which include
SNAP participation ​​zi​t​​​and a measure ​x​ ​it​​​of household income, and separate data
from a grocery retailer, which include SNAP participation ​z​ i​t​​​and the outcomes ​y​ i​t​​​.19
Figure 7 reproduces from Hastings and Shapiro (2018) a plot of the time path
of household income around the adoption of SNAP. Specifically, denoting average
monthly household income during the quarter as ​x​ i​t​​​, we depict estimates δ​​ˆ​​ from

The patterns in Figure 7 are consistent with a model in which household income is
a determinant of SNAP eligibility as in Remark 4. We see a clear decline in income
in the time periods leading up to a household’s adoption of SNAP. Following the
adoption, we observe an increase in household income.

where ​​ω​t​​​are time effects and the outcome ​​y​it​​​represents either monthly at-home food
expenditure (Figure 8, panels A and B) or the store-brand share of food expenditures
(Figure 8, panels C and D).
In panels A and C of Figure 8, the term in (17) involving ​η​ i​t​​​is ignored and so no
attempt is made to control for confounds. Panel A shows that there is no economically meaningful pre-trend in monthly at-home food expenditure. This is consistent
with the argument in Hastings and Shapiro (2018) that the effect of cash income on
food spending is small. By contrast, panel C of Figure 8 shows a clear pre-trend in
store-brand share that is small in absolute terms but large relative to the change on
adoption. We note that, since SNAP adoption can occur at any time in the quarter,
period 0 is “partially treated.”
Panels B and D of Figure 8 use our proposed estimator, with the closest lead of ​z​ i​t​​​
serving as an excluded instrument for ​x​ ​it​​​.20 In this setting, the exclusion restriction in Assumption 1(ii) requires that SNAP receipt does not directly affect cash
income. This would fail if, for example, program entry or the anticipation of entry
leads households to reduce labor supply. Assumption 1(ii) also rules out that SNAP
receipt is correlated with the measurement error in the proxy ​x​ i​t​​​for income.
In the case of at-home food expenditures, panel B of Figure 8 shows that taking the income confound into account does not alter the conclusions from the

u­ ncorrected plot in panel A. This is because the negligible pre-trend in expenditure
implies a small response to changes in income.
By contrast, panel D of Figure 8 differs markedly from panel C because the relatively large pre-trend in store-brand share implies a significant response to changes
in income. The 2SLS estimator accounts for this pre-trend through the presence of
the confound ​η​ ​it​​​, and eliminates the pre-trend from the plot. The dynamics of storebrand share that we observe following adoption likely reflect households’ gradual
exit from the program following adoption.
Panel A of Figure 9 provides a geometric intuition for our proposed procedure.
It combines a rescaled version of Figure 7 with panel C of Figure 8. Our proposed
estimator uses the dynamics in both the household income and store-brand share in
the two quarters prior to the event to infer the effect of the confound. Geometrically
this amounts to aligning the two plots in the two-period window prior to the event.
We interpret the remaining difference, depicted in panel D of Figure 8, as an

a­ pproximation of the causal effect of SNAP adoption on the store-brand share. For
comparison, panel B of Figure 9 shows the dynamics of the confound implied by
linear extrapolation from the three periods immediately preceding the event. These
dynamics differ markedly from those of the income proxy, and imply a small initial
effect of SNAP that grows larger over time.
Figure 8 depicts two possible scenarios for applying our approach in the presence
of a clear potential confound. In the first scenario, confidence sets exclude a meaningful pre-trend in the outcome, and our proposed method formalizes the intuitive
notion that the confound does not cause significant bias in the estimation of the policy effect. In the second scenario, there is a clear pre-trend in the outcome, and our
method adjusts causal inference for the presence of the confound.
Table 1 presents estimates ​​βˆ ​​from the static analogue of (17). Although a static
model does not capture the post-treatment dynamics of the outcomes, it is a common way to summarize the effect size (Borusyak and Jaravel 2017). The first row
shows that, with no control for household income, the estimated effect of adopting
SNAP on monthly expenditure is $86, while SNAP adoption leads to a decrease in
the store-brand share of 0.4 percentage points. The second row notes that controlling
for household income directly is infeasible, as household income and the outcomes
of interest are not observed in the same data. The third row shows that, using our
proposed 2SLS estimator, the estimated effect of SNAP adoption on monthly food
expenditure is $84, similar to the first row. On the other hand, the estimated effect
on the store-brand share is a decrease of 0.7 percentage points, an increase in magnitude of almost 60 percent compared to the first row. As expected from Figure 7,
the first stage is highly significant.
The pre-test estimator, though not depicted in Table 1, is also feasible in this
context. For monthly expenditure, we cannot reject ​δ​ −
​ 2​​  = 0​at the 5 percent level
in (17) (see panel A of Figure 8), so the pre-test estimator is equivalent to using no

B. The Effect of Newspaper Entry and Exit on Electoral Politics
Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Sinkinson (2011) study the effect of newspapers on voter
turnout, exploiting variation generated by daily newspapers’ entries and exits in
local markets in the United States. Here, ​i​indexes local markets (counties) and ​t​
indexes presidential election years. The outcome ​y​ i​t​​​is voter turnout. The policy ​z​ i​t​​​ is
the number of English-language daily newspapers in the market. Following Remark
4, it is reasonable to expect the entry of a newspaper to coincide with an improvement in market profitability ​​ηi​t​​​. Because the state of the local economy could also
affect voter turnout, market profitability is a potential confound. Gentzkow, Shapiro,
and Sinkinson (2011) have proxies for profitability, including a measure ​x​ ​it​​​of the
log of the voting-eligible population. Following Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Sinkinson
(2011), we depict plots with first-differenced dependent variables.21

occurred.

online Appendix Table 2 and online Appendix Figure 11 how their inclusion affects
our results. In panel A of Figure 11, the term involving ​Δ ​ηi​ t​​​is omitted from (19).
This specification therefore does not control for newspaper profitability. Panel B

controls for market profitability by directly substituting the observed Δ
​  ​x​it​​​for Δ
in (19). Panel C uses our proposed 2SLS estimator, with the closest lead of Δ

in Assumption 1(ii) requires that newspaper entry and exit do not directly affect
population or its relationship to newspaper profitability. Figure 11 shows that we
obtain qualitatively similar results when controlling for ​​x​it​​​directly and when using
our proposed estimator.
Table 2 presents estimates ​​βˆ ​​from the static analogue of (19), which represents
the causal effect of an additional newspaper on voter turnout. The first row shows
that with no controls the estimated effect is 0.26 percentage points per newspaper.
The second row shows that controlling for the log of the voting-eligible population
leads the estimate to increase to 0.37 percentage points per newspaper. The third
row shows that our proposed 2SLS estimator gives an estimate of 0.34 percentage
points per newspaper, which is statistically and economically similar to the estimate
in the second row.22
C. The Effect of the Minimum Wage on Youth Employment
There is an ongoing debate about the effect of the minimum wage on youth
employment (Neumark, Salas, and Wascher 2014; Allegretto et al. 2017). Let ​i​
index states and t​​index quarters. The outcome ​​y​it​​​is the log of the teen (16–19)
employment-to-population ratio. The policy ​​z​it​​​is the log of the state minimum
wage. The control ​​q​it​​​is the share of teenagers in the population. We may be concerned that states implement minimum-wage increases when demand ​η​ i​t​​​for labor is
strong (Card and Krueger 1995, Neumark and Wascher 2007). We proxy for labor
22
The p​ -​values for equality of estimates relative to controlling for ​x​ ​it​​directly are 0.000 for the estimator with no
control and 0.714 for our proposed 2SLS estimator. These p​ -​values are based on 100 cluster-bootstrap replications.

market conditions using a measure ​x​ i​t​​​of the log of the prime-age (25–55) employment-to-population ratio. For prime-age workers the effect of minimum wages is
plausibly small compared to other sources of variation (Brown 1999), lending credibility to the exclusion restriction in Assumption 1(ii), which requires that the minimum wage does not affect prime-age employment or its relationship to the level of
labor demand. Directly controlling for ​​x​it​​​, as is commonly done, fails to allow for
mismeasurement of the true demand for youth labor.

Figure 13. Teen Employment at Quarters around Minimum Wage Increases
Notes: The plot shows estimates of coefficients ​​δ​k​​ from (21). In the top row, inner confidence sets as indicated by
the dashes correspond to 95 percent pointwise confidence intervals, while outer confidence sets are the uniform
95 percent sup-t bands (with critical values obtained via simulation). In panel C, dashed confidence intervals correspond to 95 percent pointwise confidence intervals, ignoring weak identification. Standard errors are clustered at
the state level.

However, the estimates are imprecise, and based on the uniform confidence intervals, we cannot reject the hypothesis of no pre-trends.
Figure 13 depicts estimates ​​δˆ ​​from three specifications of the equation:
3

(21) ​​y​it​​  = ​δ​−4+​​​(1 − ​z​i,t+3​​)​ + ​δ3​+​​ ​zi​,t−3​​  + ​  ∑ ​​​δ​ k​​​  Δ​zi​,t+k​​  + γ ​ηi​t​​  + ​q​ i′t ​ ​  θ + ​ω​t​​  + ​α​i​​  + ​ε​it​​.​
k=−2

In panel A of Figure 13, the term involving ​​ηi​t​​​is omitted from (21). This specification therefore does not control for the state of the labor market. Panel B uses
prime-age employment ​x​ ​it​​​directly as a control. Panel C depicts the results from
our proposed estimator, in which we use the closest lead of the policy, ​​z​i,t+1​​​, as an
excluded instrument for ​​x​it​​​. Because the first stage for this model is weak (cf. Table
3), the confidence set for the coefficient on ​​x​it​​​based on inversion of the AndersonRubin (AR) test consists of the entire real line. A projection argument therefore
implies that valid confidence sets in panel C of Figure 13 also include the entire real
line.

Notes: Dependent variable: log(employment/population). Each row corresponds to a different
estimate ​β
​ˆ ​​from the model in first differences given by (22). The first row uses no control for the
state of the economy. The second row uses the prime-age employment-to-population ratio as a
proxy. The third row uses our proposed 2SLS estimator, treating the change in the first lead of
the log of the minimum wage as an excluded instrument for the change in the log of the primeage employment-to-population ratio. We present both conventional standard errors and a confidence interval (in square brackets) constructed by projection based on an inversion of the AR
test for the coefficient on the change in the log of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio.
All regressions are weighted by teen population. Standard errors are clustered at the state level.

The first row of Table 3 shows that with no controls we estimate a statistically
insignificant elasticity of teen employment with respect to the minimum wage
of ​−0.0114​. The second row shows that controlling for adult employment leads
the estimated elasticity to decline in absolute magnitude to −
​ 0.0094​. This estimate
remains statistically insignificant. The third row shows that using our proposed 2SLS
estimator we estimate an elasticity of 0.0003. This estimate is statistically insignificant according both to conventional standard errors and to a confidence interval
constructed by projection based on inversion of the AR test for the coefficient on ​x​ i​t​​​,
which consists of the real line.
This last application demonstrates the limitations of our proposed estimator.
Instrument relevance requires a strong pre-trend in the covariate ​​x​it​​​. Absent such a
pre-trend, our proposed estimator is not strongly identified, and our approach implies
that the econometrician cannot learn about the parameter of interest. Arguably, however, that is a valid conclusion if we are concerned about a confound ​​ηi​t​​​and are not
confident that ​​x​it​​​is a perfect proxy for that confound.
IV. Extensions

A. Anticipatory and Dynamic Treatment Effects
The model in (6) is static in the sense that the policy has only contemporaneous
effects on the outcome. The following generalization allows for both anticipatory
effects and dynamic treatment effects:

​​​ỹ ​​it​​  = ​  ∑ ​​​β
m=−G

We assume that the number of periods G
​ ​and ​M​over which anticipatory and dynamic
effects operate are known.

ASSUMPTION 1′ (Orthogonality Conditions—Dynamic Model): There exists a
positive integer L
​ ​such that for ​ = ​{− M, …  , G − 1, G, G + 1, … , G + L}​​,
(i)	​
E​[​​z̃ ​​i,t+l​​ ​​ε̃ ​​it​​]​  = 0​  for all ​l ∈ ​.

(ii)	​
E​[​​z̃ ​​i,t+l​​ ​​ũ ​​it​​]​  = 0​ for all ​l ∈ ​.

ASSUMPTION 2′ (Rank Conditions—Dynamic Model): Let ​​w​it​​  = ​​(​​z̃ ​​i,t−M​​, … ,
​ ​as ​H = E​(​wit​ ​​​[​​z̃ ​​i,t−M​​, … , ​​z̃ ​​i,t+G​​, ​​x ​​ ̃ ′it ​]​  ​)​​. Then,
​​z̃ ​​it​​, … , ​​z̃ ​​i,t+G+L)​​ ′​   ​​and define a matrix H
(i)	​rank​(Λ)​  = R​.

(ii)	​rank​(H)​ = ​(R + M + G + 1)​​.

Following the same reasoning as in Section I, Assumption 2′ (i) allows us to write

(24)

M

​  ̃ ​  = ​​y ​​̃it​​  − ​  ∑ ​​​β
​ ​m​​ ​​z̃ ​​i,t−m​​  − ​​x̃ ​​  ′i ​​tΓ
​  ̃ ​.​
​​​v ​​̃it​​  ≡ ​​ε̃ ​​it​​  − ​​ũ ​​  ′i ​​tΓ
m=−G

Assumption 1′ implies that E
​ [​​wi​t​​ ​​ṽ ​​it​​]​  = 0​, and Assumption 2′ (ii) guarantees that
these moment conditions are sufficient to identify the causal effects ​​β​m​​​.
As in the static model, estimation may then proceed by GMM, for example
through a 2SLS regression of ​​y​ ̃ ​​it​​​ on ​​​{​​z̃ ​​i,t−m}​​ m​​  M=−G​​and ​​x​ ̃ ​​it​​​, treating the covariates ​​x​ ̃ ​​it​​​
as mismeasured regressors and the leads of ​​z​ ̃ ​​it​​​beyond period ​G​as the excluded
instruments.
B. Overidentification and Moment Selection
We have maintained throughout that ​K = R​, and in our simulations and applications we use the ​R​closest leads of ​​​z̃ ​​it​​​as instruments. These choices result in an
exactly identified model. In practical situations, the model may be overidentified,
which raises issues of moment selection and specification testing.
More Leads than Confounds.—In some situations, the researcher may be
interested in using more than ​R​leads of ​​​z̃ ​​it​​​as instruments. Because the number
of potential leads will usually be small and the instruments are ordered (with
closer leads more likely to be informative), BIC will often be a natural choice
among formal methods for instrument selection (Rao et al. 2001). In online
Appendix Figure 4 , we present simulation results from using BIC to select among
potential leads.
If more than ​R​leads are used, the model is overidentified and the usual principles
for choosing an efficient GMM estimator will apply (Newey and McFadden 1994).
Further, the overidentifying restrictions can be tested, and such a test is intuitively
similar to looking at whether there are pre-trends in the event plots for our proposed
2SLS estimator. However, while such tests are valid tests of a null of correct specification, choosing a model based on such tests will create the usual pre-test biases
(Leeb and Pötscher 2005, Guggenberger 2010).

More Covariates than Confounds.—If the number of covariates is larger than
the number of confounds (​K > R​), standard methods for moment selection and
combination may be used to find data-driven weights to use all covariates efficiently
(Newey and McFadden 1994).
As in the case of multiple leads, tests for overidentification will be available in
this case, and with the same caveats.
An alternative approach available in this case is to use the methods developed
in the literature on measurement errors (Abbring and Heckman 2007, Heckman
and Vytlacil 2007). For instance, suppose that R
​ = 1​, ​K = 2​, and that the errors ​​u​ ̃ ​​it​​​
are uncorrelated across covariates and with ​​ε​ ̃ ​​it​​​. Then, under a rank condition analogous to Assumption 2(ii), the model is identified without the need to treat leads of
the policy as excluded instruments. Of course, whether such covariance restrictions
are appropriate will depend on the economic setting.25
V. Conclusion

We consider a linear panel data model with possible endogeneity. We show how
to exploit a covariate related to the confound but unaffected by the policy of interest
to perform causal inference in this setting. We validate our proposal in simulations
from a range of data-generating processes, and apply it to three economic settings of
interest. Alternative approaches, such as estimation following a test for pre-trends,
perform poorly in our simulations.

In the applications we have in mind, the number of plausible proxies is small. If there are instead many
covariates that contain independent information about the unobserved confounds, one may alternatively adapt methods from the literature on factor models in high dimensions as in, e.g., Stock and Watson (2002), Bai (2003), Bai
and Ng (2010), and Hansen and Liao (2019).
