Abstract
This paper provides statistical methods that permit the association of socioeconomic status
and health to be partially unraveled in panel data by excluding some postulated causal paths, or
delimiting their range of action. These methods are applied to the Asset and Health Dynamics
of the Oldest Old (AHEAD) Panel to test for the absence of causal links from socioeconomic
status (SES) to health innovations and mortality, and from health conditions to innovations in
wealth. We conclude that in this elderly American population, where Medicare covers most
acute care and pension income is not a2ected by ability to work, the evidence supports the
hypothesis of no direct causal link from SES to mortality and to incidence of most sudden onset
health conditions (accidents and some acute conditions), once initial health conditions are controlled, but there is some association of SES with incidence of gradual onset health conditions
(mental conditions, and some degenerative and chronic conditions), due either to causal links
or to persistent unobserved behavioral or genetic factors that have a common in4uence on both
SES and innovations in health. There is mixed evidence for an association of health conditions
and innovations in wealth. The death of a spouse appears to have a negative e2ect on the wealth
of the survivor; this is plausibly a direct causal e2ect. There is evidence for some association
of health conditions with increased dissaving from liquid wealth for intact couples and singles.
From these 7ndings, we conclude that there is no evidence that SES-linked therapies for acute
diseases induce mortality di2erentials. The question of whether SES-linked preventative care in4uences onset of chronic and mental diseases remains open. The appendix to this paper containing

1. Introduction
1.1. The issue
The links between health, wealth, and education have been studied in a number of
populations, with the general 7nding that higher socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with better health and longer life. 1 In a survey of this literature, Goldman
(2001) notes that this association has been found in di2erent eras, places, genders, and
ages, and occurs over the whole range of SES levels, so that it is not linked solely to
poverty. The association holds for a variety of health variables (most illnesses, mortality, self-rated health status, psychological well-being, and biomarkers such as allostatic
load) and alternative measures of SES (wealth, education, occupation, income, level of
social integration). 2 There has been considerable discussion of the causal mechanisms
behind this association, but there have been relatively few natural experiments that
permit causal paths to be de7nitively identi7ed. 3 In this paper, we test for the absence
of direct causal links in an elderly population by examining whether innovations in
health and wealth in a panel are in4uenced by features of the historical state.

et al. (1992).
2 The associations can become more complex when multiple health conditions and multiple SES measures
are studied. Competing risks may mask the hazard for late-onset diseases; e.g., elevated mortality risk from
cardiovascular diseases in low SES groups may induce an apparent reverse relationship between SES and
later-onset cancer in the surviving population (Adler and Ostrove, 1999). Longer-run measures of SES such
as education, occupation, and wealth appear to have a stronger association with health status than current
income (Fuchs, 1993). Using carefully measured wealth, we 7nd that it explains most of the association
with health, and education conditioned on wealth is not systematically correlated with health.

transitions. First, low SES may lead to failures to seek medical care and delay in
detection of conditions, reduced access to medical services, or less e2ective treatment. 4 Also, increased risk of health problems may result from increased stress or
frustration, or increased exposure to environmental hazards, that are associated with
low SES. 5 These factors could provide direct causal links from SES history to health
events. Second, poor health may reduce the ability to work or look after oneself, and
increase medical care expenditures, leading to reduced income and less opportunity to
accumulate assets. This could provide a direct causal link from health to changes in
SES.
There may also be hidden common factors that lead to ecological association of
health and SES. For example, unobserved genetic heterogeneity may in4uence both resistance to disease and ability to work. Causal links may be reinforced or confounded
by behavioral response. Behavioral factors such as childhood nutrition and stress, exercise, and smoking may in4uence both health and economic activity level. For example,
tastes for work and for “clean living”, whether genetic or learned, may in4uence both
health and earnings. Finally, rational economic decision-making may induce robust consumers to accumulate in order to 7nance consumption over a long expected retirement,
or unhealthy individuals to spend down assets.
4 There may be an important distinction between direct causal mechanisms in4uencing mortality, conditioned on health status, and direct causal mechanisms in4uencing onset of health conditions. For mortality,
an SES gradient could be due to di2erentially e2ective treatment of acute health conditions. For morbidity,
an SES gradient could re4ect di2erentials in prevention and detection of health conditions. These involve
di2erent parts of the health care delivery system, and di2er substantially in the importance of individual
awareness and discretion, and allocation of costs between Medicare and the individual.
5 For example, industrial and traKc pollution, and poor dwelling ventilation are risk factors for lung
disease, and housing prices and household income are negatively correlated with air pollution levels in
census data (Chay and Greenstone, 2000).

Preston and Taubman (1994), Smith and Kington (1997a, b), and Smith (1998, 1999)
give detailed discussions of the various causal mechanisms that may be at work, and the
role of behavioral response from economic consumers. The epidemiological literature
(Goldman, 2001) uses a di2erent terminology for the causal paths: links from SES to
health innovations are termed causal mechanisms, while links from health to SES are
termed selection or reverse causation mechanisms. Apparent association due to measurement errors, such as overstatement of the SES of the healthy or under-detection of
illnesses among the poor, are called artifactual mechanisms. 6 This literature classi7es
all common factors in terms of their implicit initial action as either causal or selection
mechanisms. 7
1.2. This study
We study the population of elderly Americans aged 70 and older, and in this population test for the absence of direct causal paths from SES to innovations in health,
and from health status to innovations in SES. These hypotheses will in general be
accepted only if no causal link is present and there are no persistent hidden factors
that in4uence both initial state and innovations. Rejection of one of these hypotheses
does not demonstrate a direct causal link, since this may be the result of common hidden factors. However, in an elderly population persistent hidden factors will often be
manifest in observed covariates, so that once these covariates are controlled, the residual impact of the hidden factors on innovations will be small. For example, genetic
frailty that is causal to both health problems and low wages, leading to low wealth,
may be expressed through a health condition such as diabetes. Then, onset of new
health conditions that are also linked to genetic frailty may be only weakly associated
with low wealth, once diabetic condition has been entered as a covariate. Thus, in this
population, rejection of the hypotheses may provide useful diagnostics for likely causal
paths.
The objectives and conclusions of this paper are limited. We study only elderly
Americans, for whom Medicare provides relatively homogeneous and comprehensive
health care at limited out-of-pocket cost to the individual. This population is retired,
so that new health problems do not impact earnings. Statements about the presence or
absence of direct causal mechanisms in this population, given previous health and SES
status, say nothing about the structure of these mechanisms in a younger population,
6 Consider phenomena such as under-estimation of the hazard of a disease due to competing risks from
other illnesses or death. In an unfortunate discrepancy in terminology, economists would call this a selection
e2ect while epidemiologists would classify it as an artifactual mechanism rather than a selection mechanism.
7 Usually, one can argue that observed association must originate from some initial causal action, so that
common factors originate from some initial direction of causation. However, there is no apparent initial causal
action for genetically linked conditions such as Downs syndrome, which increase mortality risk and preclude
work. Further, as a practical matter, it is often impossible to make observations at the high frequencies that
would be required to identify causal chains when feedbacks are nearly instantaneous. Then common factors
will appear at feasible levels of detection to operate simultaneously, and their true causal structure will not
be identi7ed. For these reasons, there would be considerable merit in adding common mechanisms to the
epidemiologist’s classi7cations.

where associations of health and SES emerge as a result of some pattern of causation
and operation of common factors.
Our tests for the absence of causality do not address the question of how to identify
invariant models and causal links when these tests fail. If a test for the absence of a
direct causal path is rejected, it may be possible through natural or designed experiments to separate causal and ecological e2ects; see Angrist et al. (1996), Heckman
(2000, 2001). Suppose a strictly exogenous variable is causal to SES, and clearly not
itself directly causal to health or causal to common factors. Then, an association of
this variable with innovations in health conditions can only be through a direct causal
link from SES to health. A variable with these properties is termed an proper instrument or control variable for SES. Proper instruments are hard to 7nd. They can be
obtained through designed experiments, where random treatment assignment precludes
the possibility of confounding by common factors, provided recruitment and retention of
experimental subjects does not re-introduce confounding. For example, an experiment
that randomly assigned co-payment rates and coverage within Medicare for prescription drugs or assisted living could provide evidence on direct causal links from SES
to health conditions, provided attrition and compliance are not problems. Occasionally,
natural experiments may provide random treatment assignment. Economic events that
impact individuals di2erently and that are not related to their prior SES or health are
potentially proper instruments. For example, a tax change that a2ects wealth di2erently
in di2erent States is arguably a proper instrument, as is a change in mandated Medicaid
coverage that has a di2erential impact across States. Individual events such as receipt
of inheritances may be proper instruments, although they would be confounded if they
are anticipated, or if the probability of their occurrence is linked to health status; see
Meer et al. (2001). Weak association between SES and a proper instrument for it
makes it diKcult to obtain precise estimates of direct causal e2ects; see Staiger and
Stock (1997).
Section 2 of this paper discusses the foundation for econometric causality tests, and
sets out the models for the dynamics of health and SES that will be used for our
analysis. Section 3 describes the panel study and data that we use. Section 4 describes the association of SES and prevalence of health conditions in the initial wave
of the panel. Section 5 analyzes incidence of new health conditions, and presents
tests for non-causality of SES for the incidence of health innovations. Section 6
tests for the absence of a causal link from health conditions to wealth accumulation and other SES indicators. Section 7 uses our estimated models for prevalence
and incidence to simulate life histories for a current population aged 70 under
counterfactual (and unrealistically simplistic) interventions that assume a major health
hazard can be removed, or SES shifted for the entire population. This simulation accounts consistently for co-morbidities and competing hazards over the life course. The
purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate the feasibility of using our modeling approach for policy applications when the models pass the causality tests described in
next section. Finally, Section 8 gives conclusions and outlines topics for future research. The appendix to this paper, containing Tables A1–A8 with detailed estimation
results, and the data and computer routines we use, are posted on the internet at

2. Association and causality in panel data
2.1. Testing causality
The primary purpose of this study is to test for direct causal links between SES and
health. There is a large literature on the nature of causality and the interpretation of
“causality tests”. 8 Our analysis 7ts generally within the approach of Granger (1969),
Sims (1972), and Hoover (2001), but our panel data structure permits some re7nements
that are not available in a pure time series setting.
Let Yt denote a K-vector of demographic, health, and socioeconomic random variables for a household at date t and interpret a realization of these variables as an
observation in one wave of a panel survey. Let Yt be the information set containing
the history of this vector through date t. Let
f(Yt |Yt−1 )
≡ f1 (Y1t |Yt−1 ) · f2 (Y2t |Y1t ; Yt−1 ) · : : : · fK (YKt |Y1t ; : : : ; YK−1; t ; Yt−1 )

(1)

denote a model of the conditional distribution of Yt given Yt−1 . Without loss of generality, we have written this model as a product of one-dimensional conditional distributions, given history and given components of Yt determined previously. Writing the
model in this way does not imply that the components of Yt form a causal chain, as
they may be simultaneously determined, or determined in some causal sequence other
than the speci7ed sequence. However, the model structure simpli7es if the current
components of Yt in the speci7ed order do form a causal chain or are conditionally independent. If one takes Wold’s view that causal action takes time, then for suKciently
brief time intervals, fK (YKt |Y1t ; : : : ; YK−1; t ; Yt−1 ) will not depend on contemporaneous
variables, and what Granger calls “instantaneous causality” is ruled out. In practice,
time aggregation to observation intervals can introduce apparent simultaneous determination. Conversely, in applications where time aggregation is an issue, one can treat
observed variables as indicators for some latent causal chain structure de7ned for very
short time intervals.
We shall focus on 7rst-order Markov processes, specializations of (1) in which only
the most recent history conveys information,
f(Yt |Yt−1 ) ≡ f(Yt |Yt−1 )
≡ f1 (Y1t |Yt−1 ) · f2 (Y2t |Y1t ; Yt−1 ) · : : : · fK (YKt |Y1t ; : : : ; YK−1; t ; Yt−1 ):
(2)
Note that if (1) is a higher-order Markov process, then (2) can be obtained by expanding the variables in Yt to include higher-order lags. Greater generality could be
achieved via a hidden Markov structure in which the observed Yt are deterministic

functions of a latent 7rst-order Markov process. 9 We leave this extension for future
research.
Model (2) is valid for a given history Yt−1 if it is the true conditional distribution
of Yt given this history. Term f a structural or causal model, or a (probabilistic)
law, for Yt relative to a family of histories if it has the invariance property that it
is valid for each history in the family. Operationally, this means that within speci7ed
domains, f has the transferability property that it is valid in di2erent populations
where the marginal distribution of Yt−1 changes, and the predictability or invariance
under treatments property that it remains valid following policy interventions that
alter the marginal distribution of Yt−1 . By including temporal or spatial variables in
Y , it is possible to weaken invariance requirements to 7t almost any application. Done
indiscriminately, this creates a substantial risk of producing an “over-7tted” model that
will be invalid for any “out-of-sample” policy interventions. Then, proposed models
should be as generic as possible. However, it may be necessary in some applications
to model “regime shifts” that account for factors that are causal for some populations
or time periods, and not for others.
Suppose the vector Yt = (Ht ; St ; Xt ) is composed of subvectors Ht , St , and Xt , which
will later be interpreted as health conditions, SES status, and strictly exogenous variables, respectively. We say that S is conditionally non-causal for H , given X , if
f(Ht |Ht−1 ; Xt−1 ) is a valid model; i.e., given Ht−1 and Xt−1 , knowledge of St−1 is
not needed to achieve the invariance properties of a causal model. Conversely, if
f(Ht |Ht−1 ; St−1 ; Xt−1 ) ≡ f(Ht |Ht−1 ; Xt−1 ), then knowledge of St−1 contributes to the
predictability of Ht . Note that either one or both conditional non-causality of S for H
and conditional non-causality of H for S may hold. If either holds, then H and S can
be arrayed in a (block) causal chain, and if both hold, then H and S are conditionally independent. Writing model (2) as a product of univariate conditional probabilities
fi (Hit |H1t ; : : : ; Hi−1; t ; Ht−1 ; St−1 ; Xt−1 ), one can test for conditional non-causality of S
for each component Hi . It is possible to have a causal chain in which S is conditionally
causal to a previous component of H , and this component is in turn “instantaneously”
causal to Hj , yet there is no direct causal link from S to Hi . Placing S after H in the
vector Y , we have conditional probabilities f(St |Ht ; Ht−1 ; St−1 ; Xt−1 ). There may be
instantaneous conditional independence of H and S, with the conditional distribution
of St not depending on Ht or conditional non-causality of H for S, with the conditional
distribution not depending on Ht−1 , or both. The statement that X is strictly exogenous in a valid model (2) is equivalent to the condition that H and S are conditionally
non-causal for X in this model. 10
The conventional de7nition of a causal model or probabilistic law requires that f be
valid for the universe of possible histories (except possibly those in a set that occurs
with probability zero); see Pearl (2000). It is possible to reject statistically a proposed
9

Any discrete-time stationary stochastic process can be approximated (in distribution for restrictions to a
7nite number of periods) by a 7rst-order hidden Markov model so there is no loss of generality in considering
only models of this form; see Kunsch et al. (1995).
10 Econometricians have traditionally used the term strictly exogenous to refer to properties of variables in
the true data generation process, a stronger non-positivistic version of this condition.

causal model by showing that it is highly improbable that an observed sample with a
given history was generated by this model. It is far more diKcult using statistical analysis to conclude inductively that a proposed model is valid for the universe of possible
histories. We have the far more limited objective of providing a foundation for policy
analysis, where it is the invariance property under policy interventions that is crucial to
predicting policy consequences. We have de7ned validity and non-causality as properties of a model, and of the outcomes of a process of statistical testing that could in
principle be conducted on this model. Only within the domain where the model is valid,
and invariance con7rms that the model is accurately describing the true data generation
process, can these limited positivistic model properties be related to the causal structure embedded in the true data generation process. Further, we can choose the domain
over which invariance will be tested to make the de7nition operational and relevant
for a speci7c analysis of policy interventions. Similarly, our de7nition of conditional
non-causality is a positivistic construct in the spirit of the purely statistical treatment
of “causality” by Granger (1969), and the test we will use is simply Granger’s test for
the absence of causality, augmented with invariance conditions. Thus for example, if
our analysis using this framework concludes that SES is not conditionally causal for
new health events within the domain where the Medicare system 7nances and delivers
health care, then this 7nding would support the conclusion that policy interventions in
the Medicare system to increase access or reduce out-of-pocket medical expenses will
not alter the conditional probabilities of new health events, given the health histories
of enrollees in this system. It is unnecessary for this policy purpose to answer the
question of whether the analysis has uncovered a causal structure in any deeper sense.
Econometric analysis is better matched to the modest task of testing invariance and
non-causality in limited domains than to the grander enterprise of discovering universal
causal laws. However, our emphasis on invariance properties of the model, and on tests
for Granger causality within invariant families, is consistent with the view of philosophers of science that causality is embedded in “laws” whose validity as a description
of the true data generation process is characterized by their invariance properties; see
Pearl (2000), Feigl (1953), and Nozick (2001).
2.2. Some speci4c formulations
Starting from class (2), we consider operational models of the linear latent variable
form
Yit∗ = Y1; t

1i

+ · · · + Yi−1; t

i−1; i


+ Yt−1

i

+ i − i it

with
Yit = i (Yit∗ ; Yt−1 );
∗

(4)

where Y is a latent variable, it is an unobserved disturbance that is standard normal
and independent across i and t, and is a partial observability mapping that depends
on the latent variable, and possibly on the lagged variables. For example, for a chronic
health condition such as diabetes, Yit will indicate whether there has ever been a diagnosis of the disease, with Yit = max{Y1; t−1 ; 1(Yit∗ ¿ 0)} For an acute condition such

11

as a heart attack, Yit = 1(Yit∗ ¿ 0) indicates a new occurrence. Components of Y may
be binomial or ordered discrete variables such as health status, or continuous variables such as household income. In this model, the  s, , , and  are parameters;
restrictions are imposed as necessary for identi7cation. In (3), the linearity in variables and parameters, the 7rst-order Markov property, and the triangular dependence
of Yit∗ on previous components of Yt are not, in themselves, particularly restrictive,
as one can approximate any continuous Markov model of form (2) by a form (3) in
which Yt is expanded to include transformations and interactions to suKcient order.
The normality assumption is also not restrictive in principle. A latent random variable with conditional CDF F(Y1t∗ | Yt−1 ) and the partial observability transformation
(4) can be rede7ned using the standard normal CDF  as Y1t∗∗ = −1 (F(Y1t∗ | Yt−1 ))
and Y1t = 1 (F −1 ((Y1t∗∗ ) | Yt−1 ); Y1; t−1 ); this gives a version of models (3) and (4) in
which the disturbance is standard normal. 11 The same construction can be applied to
the remaining components of Yt . The causal chain assumption is innocuous when the
time interval is too short for most causal actions to operate, and the components of
Yt are conditionally independent. However, the causal chain assumption is much more
substantive restriction when the time interval is long enough so that multiple events
have time to occur, as it rules out even the feedbacks that would appear in multiple
iterations of a true causal chain. Of course, the generally non-restrictive approximation
properties of models (3) and (4) do not imply that a particular speci7cation chosen for
an application is accurate, and failures of tests for invariance can also be interpreted
as diagnostics for inadequate speci7cations.
In models (3) and (4), a binomial component i of Yt with the partial observability
mapping max{Yi; t−1 ; 1(Yit∗ ¿ 0)} and the identifying restriction i = 1 satis7es Yit = 1
if Yi; t−1 = 1, and otherwise is one with the probit probability

Analogous expressions can be developed for ordered or continuous components.
2.3. Measurement issues
A feature of the panel we use is that the waves are separated by several years and
the interviews within a wave are spread over many months, with the months between
waves di2ering across households. If model (2) applies to short intervals, say months,
then the transition from one wave in month t to another in month t + s is described
by the probability model

f(Yt+1 |Yt ) · : : : · f(Yt+s |Yt+s−1 ):
(6)
f(Yt+s |Yt ) =

Direct computation of these probabilities will generally be intractable, although analysis
using simulation methods is possible.

A major additional complication in our panel is that interview timing appears to
be related to health status, with household or proxy interviews delayed for individuals
who have died or have serious health conditions. This introduces a spurious correlation
between apparent time at risk and health status that will bias estimation of structural
parameters. To study empirical approximations to (6) and corrections for spurious
correlation, we consider a simple model of interview delay. Let p = ( + x) denote
the monthly survival probability for an individual who was alive at the previous wave
interview, where x is a single time-invariant covariate that takes the value −1, 0, +1,
each with probability 1/3. Counting from the time of the previous wave interview,
let k denote the number of months this individual lives, and c denote the month
that interviews begin for the current wave. 12 There is a distribution of initial contact
times; let q denote the probability of a month passing without being contacted, and let
m denote the month of initial contact. Assume that an individual who is living at the
time of initial contact is interviewed immediately, but for individuals who have died by
the time of initial contact, there is an interview delay, with r denoting the probability of
an additional month passing without a completed interview with a household member
or proxy. Let n denote the number of months of delay in this event. Assume that m and
n are not observed, but the actual inter-wave interval t, equal to m if the individual is
alive at time of initial contact, and equal to m + n otherwise, is observed. The density
of k is pk−1 (1 − p) for k ¿ 1. The density of m is qm−c (1 − q) for m ¿ c. Let d be
an indicator for the event that the individual is dead at the time of initial contact. The
probability of t and d = 0 is h(0; t) = qt−c (1 − q)pt , the product of the probability of
contact at t and the probability of being alive at t. The probability of t and d = 1,
denoted h(1; t), is the sum of the probabilities that the individual is dead at an initial

If r ¡ pq, then h(1; t) = (1 − q)(1 − r){(qt−c+1 − r t−c+1 )=(q − r) − pc ((pq)t−c+1 −
r t−c+1 )=(pq − r)}. Then, the probability of an observed inter-wave interval t is h(t) =
h(0; t) + h(1; t), and the conditional probability of d = 1, given t, is P(1|t) = h(1; t)=h(t).
Absent interview delay, the conditional probability of d = 1 given t would be simply
pt−1 (1 − p). The parameter values = −2:47474, = 0:3, c = 22, q = 0:85, and
r = 0:5 roughly match our panel. For these values, the median inter-wave interval is
25.5 months, and at t = 34, 87 percent of the interviews have been completed.
Fig. 2 plots the inverse normal transformations of the true death rate pt−1 (1−p) and
the apparent death rate P(1|t) against log(t) for each value of the covariate x. The true
relationship is to a reasonable empirical approximation linear in x and in log(t). Then,
in the absence of interview delay, one could approximate p, given x, with reasonable
accuracy by estimating a probit model for death of the form (% + &x + ' log(t)),
and then estimating p using the transformation p = (1 − (% + &x + ' log(t)))1=t for

It does not matter for the example if the previous wave interview month is 7xed or has a distribution,
provided the relative inter-wave interval c is 7xed, and current wave outcomes are independent of the timing
of the previous wave interview.

the observed inter-wave interval t. 13 However, the 7gure shows that interview delay
induces a sharp gradient of apparent mortality hazard with inter-wave interval, so that an
estimated model will not extrapolate to realistic mortality hazards over shorter periods.
A simple imputation of time at risk up to initial contact leads again to models that work
well with the procedure just outlined for estimation of p conditioned on x. A simple
imputed time of initial contact for those who have died is the observed inter-wave
interval less the di2erence in the mean inter-wave interview times for dead and living
respondents. This imputation can be adjusted further so that the extrapolated annual
death rate, (% + ' log(12) + &x), matches the sample average mortality rate. We do
the additional adjustment for our panel, with results that are almost identical to the
simple imputation of time of initial contact.
We conducted a Monte Carlo calculation of the approximations above in a sample
of 50,000. In this simulation, the empirical approximation to observed mortality in the
absence of interview delay is (−3:1053 + 0:5327x + 0:652 log(t)). With interview delay and the simple imputation described above, (−2:9900 + 0:5349x + 0:6174 log(t))
is the empirical approximation. 14 Table 1 gives the annual mortality rates implied by
these approximations. From these results, we conclude 7rst that in the absence of interview delay, the probit model (% + ' log(t) + &x) provides an adequate approximation
to exact annual mortality rates as a function of time at risk, across values of the covariate x that substantially change relative risk, and second that this remains true in

13

A Box–Cox transformation of time at risk, z = 4(t 1=4 − 1), gives a somewhat better approximation in
the probit model than log(t), but has no appreciable e2ect on the accuracy of estimated monthly transition
probabilities.
14 The model estimated with interview delay and without imputation, is (−4:6639 + 0:5349x +
1:1178 log(t)).

where s is the median inter-wave interval, and the 7nal approximation holds when
the probability of a transition is small. Formula (9) generalizes to any probability of
a transition from the status quo, with the probability of remaining at the initial state
de7ned so that all the transition probabilities sum to one. We expect this formula to
approximate well the probabilities of no new health conditions in a sample population
over periods corresponding to the observed inter-wave intervals.
Estimation of models based on (2)–(8) is straightforward. Because of the independence assumption on the disturbances and the absence of common parameters
across equations, the estimation separates into a probit, ordered probit, or ordinary
least-squares regression for each component of Y , depending on whether the partial
observability mapping is binary, ordered, or linear. Conventional likelihood ratio tests
can be used for the signi7cance of explanatory variables.

3. The AHEAD panel data
3.1. Sample characteristics
Our data come from the Asset and Health Dynamics among the Oldest-Old
(AHEAD) study. 15 This is a panel of individuals born in 1923 or earlier, and their
spouses. At baseline in 1993 the AHEAD panel contained 8222 individuals representative of the non-institutionalized population, except for over-samples of blacks, Hispanics
and Floridians. Of these subjects, 7638 were over age 69; the remainder were younger
spouses. There were 6052 households, including individuals living alone or with others, in the sample. The wave 1 surveys took place between October 1993 and August
1994, with half the total completed interviews 7nished before December 1993. The
wave 2 surveys took place approximately 24 months later, between November 1995
and June 1996, with half the total completed interviews 7nished by the beginning of
February 1996. The wave 3 surveys took place approximately 27 months after that,
between January 1998 and December 1998, with half the total completed interviews
7nished near the beginning of March 1998. In each wave, there was a long but thin tail
of late interviews, heavily weighted with subjects who had moved, or required proxy
interviews due to death or institutionalization. Subjects never interviewed, directly or
by proxy, are excluded from the calculation of the distribution of interview months.
AHEAD is a continuing panel, but it has now been absorbed into the larger Health
and Retirement Study (HRS), which is being interviewed on a 3-year cycle.
The AHEAD panel has substantial attrition, with death being the primary but not
the only cause. A signi7cant e2ort has been made to track attritors, and identify those
who have died through the National Death Register. Fig. 3 describes outcomes for the
full age-eligible sample. For subjects where a proxy interview was possible, an “exit
interview” gives information on whether decedents had a new occurrence of cancer,
heart attack, or stroke since the previous wave. From the 6743 age-eligible individuals
who did not attrit prior to death, we formed a working sample for analysis consisting of 6489 by excluding 254 additional individuals with critical missing information.
Fig. 4 describes their outcomes. In a few cases, attritors in wave 2 rejoined the sample
in wave 3, but we treat these as permanent attritors because the missing interview
makes the observation unusable.
The restriction of the AHEAD panel to the non-institutionalized elderly in wave 1
selects against those with the highest mortality risk, particularly at the oldest ages, but
the impact of this selection attenuates over time. For white females, Fig. 5 compares the
observed annual mortality rate in the AHEAD panel with the expected annual mortality
rate from the 1997 Life Tables for the United States (U.S. Census, 1999). 16 Between
15 The AHEAD survey is conducted by the University of Michigan Survey Research Center for the National
Institute on Aging; see Soldo et al. (1997).
16 The AMR for the AHEAD sample is the actual death rate between waves for each 5-year segment of
ages in the initial wave, annualized using the median 25.5. month interval between the waves. The AMR
from the life tables is obtained by applying life table death rates by month to the actual months at risk
for each individual in the 5-year segment of ages in the initial wave to calculate expected deaths between
waves. This is annualized. For these calculations, the distribution of months at risk for decedents is assumed
to be the same as that for survivors.

waves 1 and 2, the AHEAD mortality risk is substantially below the life table for ages
above 75, re4ecting the selection e2ect of non-institutionalization. Between waves 2
and 3, this e2ect has essentially disappeared. There is a persistent divergence of the
mortality risks above age 90. In this range, the AHEAD data is sparse, so the curve
is imprecisely determined. However, the life tables derived from historical mortality
experience may overstate current mortality risk at advanced ages. Fig. 6 makes the same
mortality experience comparisons for the full AHEAD working sample, and draws the
same conclusions. 17

background demographics. A list of the health conditions we study, with summary

statistics, is given in Table 2. A list of the socioeconomic conditions and demographic
variables we use is given in Table 3. Appendix Table A1 lists the variable transformations used in our statistical analysis. 18 In setting up causality tests, using the framework
set out in Section 2, we will use the health conditions, followed by the socioeconomic
conditions, in the order given in these tables. We list cancer, heart disease, and stroke
7rst because they may be instantaneously causal for death, and because we have information from decedent’s exit interviews on new occurrence of these diseases. We group
the remaining health conditions by degenerative and chronic conditions, then accidents,
then mental conditions, since if there is any contemporaneous causality, it will plausibly 4ow in this order. Similarly, if there is contemporaneous causality between health
and socioeconomic conditions, it plausibly 4ows from the former to the latter.

3.3. Constructed variables
The collection and processing of some of the variables requires comment. AHEAD
has an extensive battery of questions about health conditions, including mental health.
Most health conditions are asked for in the form “Has a doctor ever told you that
you had: : :?”. However, for cancer, heart disease, and stroke, subjects are also asked
if there was a new occurrence since the previous interview, and for some conditions
such as arthritis, incontinence, and falls, the questions in wave 1 ask for an occurrence
in the past 12 months. We note that there are some major groups of health conditions
that were not investigated in AHEAD: degenerative neurological diseases, kidney and
liver diseases, immunological disorders other than arthritis, sight and hearing problems, back problems, and accidents other than falls. The BMI index is calculated from
self-reported height and weight. Information is collected on the number of ADL limitations, for six activities of daily living, and on the number of IADL limitations, for
7ve instrumental activities of daily living. A high ADL limitation count indicates that
the individual has diKculty with personal self-care, while a high IADL limitation count
indicates diKculty in household management. The study collects data on self-assessed
health status, where the subject is asked to rate his or her health as excellent, very
good, good, fair or poor. We use an indicator for a poor/fair response. No reference
is made to other groups such as “people your age.” The study contains the CESD
battery of questions measuring general mood; and from this we form an indicator for
depression.
AHEAD is linked to Medicare records. There is insuKcient detail to permit reconciliation of self-reports on objective health conditions against diagnoses in the medical
records, but errors in self-reports are an issue. We 7nd small, but signi7cant, inconsistencies across waves of AHEAD in reported chronic conditions. A study of Canadian
data for a younger population 7nds substantial discrepancies between self-reported conditions and diagnoses from medical records, particularly for chronic conditions such as
arthritis; see Baker et al. (2001). These authors also 7nd support for a “self-justi7cation”
hypothesis that non-workers are more likely to make false positive claims for health
conditions. If this reporting behavior carries into old age, then the reduction in SES
as a consequence of spotty employment would induce an artifactual association of
self-reported health conditions and SES.
The study measures cognition using a battery of questions which test several domains (Herzog and Wallace, 1997): learning and memory are assessed by immediate
and delayed recall from a list of 10 words that were read to the subject; reasoning,
orientation and attention are assessed from Serial 7’s, counting backwards by 1 and
the naming of public 7gures, dates and objects. 19 This score re4ects both long-term
native ability and health-related impairments due to health events. We carry out the
following statistical analysis to reduce the e2ect of native ability so that we can concentrate on health-related loss of cognitive function. First, we analyze a “non-impaired”

19 Serial 7’s asks the subject to subtract 7 from 100, and then to continue subtracting from each successive
di2erence for a total of 7ve subtractions.

P. Adams et al. / Journal of Econometrics 112 (2003) 3 – 56

23

sample of younger individuals, born between 1942 and 1947, who were administered the same cognitive battery in the 1998 Health and Retirement Study as were
the AHEAD subjects. For these younger individuals, where health-related impairment
of cognitive function is rare, we carry out a LAD regression of the cognitive score
on education level, sex, and race. We use this 7tted regression to predict a “baseline” non-impaired cognitive score for each member of the AHEAD sample. An additional adjustment is required because average education levels were rising rapidly
early in the Twentieth Century, due to changes in child labor laws and introduction
of compulsory education. We assign each AHEAD subject a “1923 cohort equivalent” education level by 7rst regressing education on sex, race, and birth cohort, using a speci7cation search to 7nd interactions and non-linearities, and then adding to
their actual years of education the di2erence in the mean years of education for their
sex–race cohort and the corresponding 1923 sex–race cohort. We then calculate for
each AHEAD sample member the deviation of their cognitive score from this adjusted baseline. As a normalization, we assign a threshold such that 15 percent of
AHEAD subjects aged 70 –74 in wave 1 fall below the threshold. We then use the
same threshold in other age groups and other waves to de7ne an indicator for cognitive
impairment. 20
3.4. Measurement of wealth
AHEAD individuals and couples are asked for a complete inventory of assets and
debts, and about income sources. Subjects are asked 7rst if they have any assets in
a speci7ed category, and if so, they are asked for the amount. A non-response to the
amount is followed by unfolding bracket questions to bound the quantity in question,
and this may result in complete or incomplete bracket responses. Through the use of
unfolding brackets, full non-response to asset values was reduced to levels usually less
than 5 percent, much lower than would be found in a typical household survey. Generally, median responses among full respondents for an asset category are comparable to
other economic surveys, such as the Survey of Consumer Finance. However, changes
in reported assets between waves contain outliers that suggest signi7cant response
errors between waves. For couples, where both members are asked the questions on
assets, there is also substantial inter-subject response variation. It is possible that these
repeated reports could be used to control statistically for response error in couples.
However, there are systematic di2erences between respondents, and we use the asset
responses only from the individual that a couple says manages the household 7nances.
There may also be an issue of bias in responses recovered by unfolding brackets. Hurd
et al. (1998b) used experimental variation in the bracket sequences for two 7nancial
questions on wave 2 of AHEAD, and found that anchoring to the bracket quantities
was signi7cant.
20 When an interview was done with a proxy, the cognitive battery was not given, but the interviewee
was asked if the respondent was cognitively impaired. In our analysis, we treat proxy interview status as a
component of the state that appears as a contemporaneous explanation of cognitive impairment; the coeKcient
on this variable compensates for di2erences in the de7nitions of cognitive impairment.

24

P. Adams et al. / Journal of Econometrics 112 (2003) 3 – 56

For complete or incomplete bracket responses in an asset category, we impute continuous quantities using hot deck methods. In wave 1, if information on ownership
of an asset is missing for a subject, but this subject does give ownership status in
wave 2, then we impute wave 1 ownership by drawing from the conditional empirical
distribution of those who have the same response in wave 2 and give a response in
wave 1. For subjects missing ownership in both waves 1 and 2, we draw an ownership pair from the empirical distribution of ownership pairs for those giving responses.
Given ownership and complete or incomplete bracket information, we draw from the
empirical distribution of wave 1 continuous responses that are consistent with the subject’s bracket. In later waves, we have adopted a 7rst-order Markov cross-wave hot
deck imputation procedure that assigns a continuous quantity within the given response
bracket. First, missing ownership is imputed by choosing randomly from respondents,
conditional on ownership in the previous wave. Then, given ownership, we impute a
quantitative change in the item from the previous wave by drawing from the empirical
distribution of subjects with complete responses that fall in the corresponding brackets
in the current and the previous wave. This assures that imputed changes will have
the same empirical distribution as observed changes, given the conditioning information available. This procedure does not revise previous wave imputations, so analyses
based on earlier waves are not a2ected. We have experimented with cross-item imputation methods, where bracket information on some asset categories would be used to
re7ne the conditioning used in the imputation of other asset categories. We have found
that this has very little e2ect on the imputed variables or on the results obtained from
analyses that use these variables. Therefore, we carry out all imputations one item at
a time.
Measured wealth is accumulated over 11 asset categories, including imputed items.
We distinguish liquid wealth, composed of IRA balances, stocks, bonds, checking accounts, certi7cates of deposit, less debt, and non-liquid wealth, composed of net homeowner equity, other real estate, vehicles and other transportation equipment, businesses,
and other assets. The variation in reported wealth of AHEAD households by asset category is substantial from wave to wave, suggesting that in addition to real volatility
and reallocation of wealth portfolios, there are serious reporting problems with assets.
Values of businesses owned and real estate are problematic items, since current market
valuations may be unavailable to respondents, and subjective valuations may be unreliable. Suppose that Wt is measured wealth of household in wave t, in 1997 dollars,
and that Wt = Wt∗ + ,t , where Wt∗ is true wealth and ,t is reporting error. To minimize the impact of extreme outliers in wealth and wealth changes, which we believe
are a particular problem due to gross reporting errors, our statistical analysis will use
bounded transformations of measured wealth.
The equations of motion for real wealth satisfy dWi∗ =dt = rWi∗ + Si , where i = T; N; L
indexes total wealth or its non-liquid and liquid components, r is the instantaneous real
rate of return, including unrealized capital gains, and Si is the 4ow of savings to the
wealth component. Make the logistic transformation Zi =1=(1+exp(−ci Wi +di )), where
ci and di are chosen so that in AHEAD wave 1 the median and the semi-interquartile
range of Zi are one-half. Then, Zi is a monotone transformation of measured wealth
that is less sensitive to extremes. The equation of motion for Zi is dZi =dt − rZi

P. Adams et al. / Journal of Econometrics 112 (2003) 3 – 56

25

(1 − Zi )(log(Zi =(1 − Zi )) + di ) = ci Zi (1 − Zi )Si + ci Zi (1 − Zi )(d,=dt − r,). We assume
that over an inter-wave interval, this equation of motion can be approximated by
Zit − Zi; t−1 − Rt−1 Zi; t−1 (1 − Zi; t−1 )(log(Zi; t−1 =(1 − Zi; t−1 )) + di )
mt
=Sit# + 0it ;

(10)

where t indexes the wave, mt is the interval in months between waves t − 1 and t,
Rt is the S&P real rate of return over the given interval, Sit# is the measured part of
ci Zi; t−1 (1 − Zi; t−1 )Si; t−1 , attenuated at extreme values of Zi; t−1 , and the disturbance 0it
includes the measurement error ci Zi; t−1 (1 − Zi; t−1 )((,it − ,i; t−1 )=mt−1 − r,t−1 ) and the
unmeasured part of ci Zi; t−1 (1 − Zi; t−1 )Si; t−1 . We assume 0 is homoskedastic. This is
consistent with a measurement error in observed wealth that is heteroskedastic, with
gross measurement errors more likely when true wealth is near its extremes. 21 The
disturbance in (10) may be serially correlated; however, we have not incorporated
this into our analysis. The e2ect of the transformation is to substantially reduce the
in4uence of outliers in the distribution of changes in measured wealth. In application,
we specify Sit# to be a linear function of transformed nonliquid and liquid wealth,
ZT; t−1 (1−ZT; t−1 ) log(ZN; t−1 =(1−ZN; t−1 )) and ZT; t−1 (1−ZT; t−1 ) log(ZL; t−1 =(1−ZL; t−1 )),
and of other SES, demographic, and health variables, scaled by ZT; t−1 (1 − ZT; t−1 ).
3.5. Mortality and observed wealth change
A problem with the analysis of wealth changes is that terminal wealth is not observed following the death of a single, or the death of both members of a household,
introducing a selection e2ect. A second problem is that a household death may have a
direct impact on the wealth of a survivor, due to the expenses associated with a death
and the disposition of the estate. There are also severe wealth measurement problems
following a household death, since a death typically requires a valuation of assets, and
in many cases changes the 7nancially responsible respondent. For this reason, we will
analyze separately wealth changes for singles and for couples, allow a regime shift
following the death of one member of a couple, and account for the selection that
occurs when there are no survivors.
For a single female, we adopt a bivariate selection model,
∗
Yft

∗
yft = 1(Yft
¿ 0);

Ywt observed if yft = 1;

Ywt = Yw; t−1

w

where the 7rst latent equation determines survival, yft = 1, the second equation corresponds to the transformed wealth change equation (10) with dependence on the previous
state Yw; t−1 and the previously determined components Yw; t of the current state, with
21 Heteroskedasticity in (10) will arise from selection e2ects, described later, as well as possibly from a
failure of the transformation to fully control the e2ects of gross reporting errors. When working with this
model, we use standard error estimates that are robust with respect to heteroskedasticity of unknown form,
and do not attempt direct tests of the implicit error speci7cation underlying transformation (10).

the wealth change observed for survivors. The disturbance f has mean zero, variance
one, and a density f(). The disturbance , is independent of , and has mean zero and
variance one. The correlation of the disturbances in the selection and wealth change
equations is 3 = '=('2 + 22 )1=2 , and the unconditional variance of the wealth change
equation is 2 = '2 + 22 . When  and , are standard normal, this is the conventional
bivariate normal selection model. However, speci7cation tests for normality fail, and
for robustness we adopt a more 4exible speci7cation, approximating the density f()
by an Edgeworth expansion,
f() =

j=0

where the &j are parameters and
 ∞ Hj () are Hermite orthogonal polynomials; see Newey
et al. (1990). Let 6jk (a) = a k Hj ()5() d. Then, the polynomials Hj () and the
partial moment functions 6jk (a) can be constructed using the recursions
H0 () = 1;

H1 () = ;

600 (a) = (−a);

and

Hj () = Hj−1 ()−(j−1)Hj−2 ()

601 (a) = 5(a);

and

60k (a) = ak−1 5(a) + (k − 1)60; k−2 (a)

and

6jk (a) = ak Hj−1 (a)5(a) + k6j−1; k−1 (a)

Appendix Table A1 derives these results and gives the leading terms for Hj and 6jk :
We require that f integrate to one and have unconditional mean zero and variance
one; this forces &0 = 1, &1 = 0, and &2 = 0. The free parameters &j for j ¿ 2 determine
higher-order moments of . For example, skewness and kurtosis are determined by
E3 = 6&3 and E4 = 3 + 24&4 . With these restrictions, we have, 7nally

We regress the squared residuals from the estimation of (15) on the right-hand-side
variables in (16) to obtain an estimate of 22 . Finally, we estimate the covariance matrix
for the parameter estimates using the generalized method of moments “sandwich” formula, with the Eicker–White procedure used for robustness against heteroskedasticity
of unknown form, and the delta method used to incorporate the e2ects of variance in
the 7rst-stage selection parameter estimates.
Next consider the e2ects of death and selection on couples. We adopt a trivariate
selection model with selection equations

for the female and male members of the couple, respectively, where f and m are
assumed to be independent with zero mean and unit variance, and densities gf (f )
and gm (m ). The independence assumption could fail if there are hidden common factors in mortality risk for both household members; e.g., indirect e2ects of smoking.
However, the frequency of multiple deaths in a household between waves is suKciently rare in the AHEAD data so that mortality risk interactions are empirically
not identi7ed. We distinguish three regimes (yf ; ym ) in which wealth change is observed: intact couples where both members survive (1,1), the female survives the death
her spouse (1,0), and the male survives the death of his spouse (0,1). We will let


Yt0 =[Yht−1 Yft−1 Ymt−1 yft ∗ Yft
ymt ∗ Ymt
] denote the vector of variables that explain wealth
change, where Yht−1 ; Yft−1 , and Ymt−1 are, respectively, previous wave common, fe
male, and male variables, Yft
are previously determined components of the current
state for females, observed only for survivors and hence zeroed out for non-survivors,

and Ymt
are the analogous previously determined components of the current state for
males, again observed only for survivors. We assume that in an observed regime jk
the wealth change model takes the form
Ywt = Yt0

wjk

+ ('f − %f 1(j + k = 1))f + ('m − %m 1(j + k = 1))m + 2jk ,; (18)

where , is independent of f and m , with zero mean and unit variance. For intact
couples, unobserved dependence of wealth change on selection is re4ected in the parameters 'f and 'm , a direct extension of the bivariate selection model to the trivariate
22

We 7nd that the coeKcients of the index in the mortality model are not sensitive to the Edgeworth
generalization, and in estimation of the model for wealth change use the 7rst-stage probit models for mortality
estimated earlier, with invariance imposed, to obtain the indices that appear in the selection e2ects.

28

case with two independent selection e2ects. For intact couples, the correlations of the
2
+'f2 +'m2 )1=2
disturbances in the selection and wealth change equations are 3f ='f =(211
2
and 3m = 'm =(211
+ 'f2 + 'm2 )1=2 . The coeKcients jk and the standard deviation 2jk
are allowed to vary by regime, to capture the observed and unobserved economic
e2ects of a death on valuation and reporting of assets. In addition, the selection e2ects
are allowed to shift, from 'f to 'f − %f for the female selection disturbance, and
from 'm to 'm − %m for the male selection disturbance. We incorporate these e2ects to
accommodate an apparent interaction in which unexpected survival of a couple (e.g., f
and m large positive) increases dissaving, perhaps due to additional medical and living
expenses linked to overcoming high mortality hazards, but the unexpected death of a
spouse (e.g., f large negative) also increases dissaving, perhaps because revaluations
of assets tend to be more drastic in circumstances where mortality hazard is low.
We adopt the Edgeworth approximation (12) for each of the densities gf (f ) and
gm (m ). In regime jk with j + k ¿ 0, letting sf = 2yf − 1 and sm = 2ym − 1, one has
4

(19)

As in the case of singles, we estimate the conditional expectation (19) by nonlinear least
squares after plugging in estimates of f and m from the earlier mortality models. A
7nal stage, analogous to (16), regresses the squared residuals from (19) for each regime
on an intercept, E(f2 |sf ) − (E(f |sf ))2 , and E(m2 |sm ) − (E(m |sm ))2 ; the coeKcient on

. Because the number of deaths among couples is
the intercept is an estimate of 2jk
relatively small, we impose the constraints w10 = w01 for empirical identi7cation.
Household income in AHEAD is also susceptible to measurement error, and to minimize its e2ect, we use income quartiles as explanatory variables. These are obtained
by converting all incomes to 1997 dollars, determining the quartiles for the pooled incomes of all subjects in all waves, and using the thresholds thus established to classify
each observed subject income. AHEAD respondents rate the safety of their neighborhood and the condition of their dwelling on a 7ve-point scale, from poor to excellent;
we use indicators for poor or fair responses.
4. SES and prevalence of health conditions
4.1. Descriptive statistics
We 7rst give some descriptive statistics on the prevalence of health conditions in
the AHEAD population. Table 4 shows prevalence rates in the AHEAD sample in
wave 1, classi7ed by age and sex, for the health conditions listed in Table 2. Generally,
prevalence of health conditions does not show a strong age gradient, indicating broadly

that morbidity rates among survivors do not increase much with age. Selection e2ects
from initial non-institutionalization and from mortality may be responsible. The major
exception is cognitive impairment, which rises as age increases. The prevalence of
acute and degenerative conditions among survivors fall after about age 80, re4ecting
the e2ect of selection due to deaths from these conditions. Males have higher prevalence
of acute and degenerative diseases than do females, but females have higher prevalence
of mental and chronic conditions, and accidents.
Fig. 7 shows the age gradients of wealth, income, and education in wave 1 of the
AHEAD sample. These gradients re4ect substantial cohort e2ects, as well as life-cycle
and composition e2ects. Work, income, and asset accumulation patterns of the AHEAD
population were impacted by World War II, and those over age 80 experienced the
Great Depression during their prime working years. The U.S. was substantially rural
when the AHEAD population was born, and education was truncated for work for
many members of this population. In addition to cohort e2ects, the curve for assets
re4ects life-cycle decumulation of assets through the retirement years, and the curve for
income re4ects the rising proportion of widows in the survivors to older ages. There
is an additional compositional e2ect from the association of SES and mortality: higher
SES is selected preferentially among survivors. However, in aggregate cross-section,
the life cycle and cohort e2ects dominate the compositional e2ects.

4.2. Models of association
To examine the association of SES and health conditions, we estimate a series of
binomial probit models of the form
P(Yit = 1|Y1t ; : : : ; Yi−1; t ; Wt ; Xt );

(20)

where the Yit are indicators for the prevalence of various health conditions, Wt denotes
a vector of SES conditions, and Xt denotes other demographic variables. The health
conditions appear in the same sequence as in Table 2, with previous conditions in
(20) providing information on association among health conditions. Included in Wt are
indicators for the top and bottom quartiles of wealth and income, indicators for 10 or
more years of education (high school) and for 14 or more years of education (college),
and indicators for poor or fair neighborhood safety and dwelling condition.
The detailed estimation results are given for whites in Appendix Table A2. Sample
sizes are not adequate for comparable models for non-whites. We 7nd the expected
patterns of co-morbidity, with a strong association of heart disease, stroke, lung disease,
and arthritis, and a strong association of diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. Incontinence is associated with cancer and stroke, and for women with diabetes,
high blood pressure, and arthritis. Falls, hip fractures, and strokes are associated. Psychiatric diseases and depression are associated with arthritis and falls. BMI is positively
associated with diabetes, high blood pressure, and arthritis, and negatively associated
with lung disease. Current smokers have lower BMI, are less likely to have diabetes,
and are more likely to be depressed. Numbers of ADLs and IADLs are positively associated with most acute diseases, arthritis, falls, hip fractures, cognitive impairment,
and psychiatric disease. A poor or fair self-reported health status is associated with
most acute and chronic diseases, with ADLs and IADLs, and with depression.
Some covariates are associated with health conditions, and may be risk factors
for these conditions. Widowhood is associated with increased cancer and heart

disease for women, increased psychiatric disease for men, and increased lung disease and depression for both men and women. For women, father’s age at death is
associated with heart disease, and mother’s age at death is associated with high blood
pressure. For men, father’s age at death is associated with high blood pressure and
arthritis.
We generally 7nd a statistically signi7cant association of SES and prevalence of
health conditions, as summarized in Table 5. It is noteworthy that for males the prevalence of the acute diseases, cancer, heart disease, and stroke, are not strongly associated
with SES, contrary to literature 7ndings for younger populations. This may be the result of early onset of these diseases, particularly among the poor and among smokers,
that selects out of the AHEAD population those males most at risk for these diseases. Overall, wealth is the SES component most commonly associated with health
conditions. Education, neighborhood rating, and dwelling rating are occasionally signi7cant, and income is almost never signi7cant. Table 6 summarizes the SES components that are individually signi7cant in their association with various health conditions,
and indicates the sign of the correlation. For a number of these conditions, prevalence rates are insuKcient to detect the e2ects of SES components with satisfactory
power. However, for heart disease, high blood pressure, arthritis, cognitive impairment, and self-rated health status, sample sizes should guarantee reliable indicators of
association.
4.3. Relative risk
To provide an indication of the direction and magnitude of the association of health
conditions and SES, we calculate relative risk for low SES versus high SES, where
the de7nition of low SES is bottom quartiles for income and wealth, less than a high
school education, and a poor/fair neighborhood and dwelling, and the de7nition of high
SES is top quartiles for income and wealth, a college education, and a good or better
neighborhood and dwelling. Relative risk is de7ned as the AHEAD sample average of

Note that the prevalence models are describing only association, not causation, so that

relative risk numbers cannot be interpreted causally. With the statistically insigni7cant
exception of cancer and psychiatric conditions for females, high SES is associated with
lower prevalence. Thus, we con7rm in the AHEAD population the literature 7ndings
of a systematic association of SES with mortality and morbidity risk, and show that
this association extends across a variety of acute, degenerative, chronic, and mental
health impairments.
5. Incidence of health conditions and tests for causality in the AHEAD panel
5.1. Models of incidence
Following the format described in Section 2, we use the incidence of new health
problems (or recurrence of cancer, heart disease, stroke, incontinence, falls, and hip
fractures), conditioned on initial demographic, health, and SES status, to test for the
absence of direct causal pathways. We de7ne incidence for a group of health conditions
to be the occurrence of a condition that was not previously reported, or a recorded
reoccurrence in the case of an acute condition (cancer, heart disease, stroke). The
descriptive statistics in Table 2 provide information on rates of incidence of these
conditions between waves. 23
We estimate models for incidence of each health condition, conditioned on previously
considered incidences of health conditions, the prevalence of health conditions in the
previous wave of the panel, and on SES and demographic variables in the previous
wave. The models are binomial probit except for BMI, which is 7tted with a linear
model using OLS, and numbers of ADL and IADL impairments, which are 7tted as
ordered probits. The estimates are given in Appendix Table A3 for whites. Again,
the data do not permit the same analysis of non-whites. The models are estimated by
stacking the data for wave 1 to wave 2 transitions above the data for wave 2 to wave 3
transitions. Table 8 summarizes the health conditions and covariates that are signi7cant
risk factors for the incidence of health conditions. The associations re4ect a number
of known co-morbidities, but show relatively few associations of SES components and
incidence of health conditions.
5.2. Causality tests
Fig. 8 gives the structure of the invariance and causality tests we report. We test
only whether the model parameters are invariant between the wave 1 to 2 transitions
and the wave 2 to 3 transitions. We exclude intercepts, age splines, and log of time
at risk terms from the invariance test. The reason for doing so is that these terms will
capture variations in survey recontact procedure across waves. However, we 7nd in
most cases that there is no signi7cant di2erence in the age spline coeKcients across
23 The incidence rates in Table 2 can be converted to crude annual rates via the formula 0:4706∗ log(1+rate).
These rates are uncorrected for population composition e2ects.

the di2erent transitions. The models are estimated unconstrained, and with the imposition of invariance, non-causality of SES, or both. Likelihood ratio tests are conducted
for invariance, with and without non-causality imposed, and for non-causality conditioned on invariance. Since the invariance test without non-causality of SES imposed,
and the non-causality test conditioned on invariance, are nested, they should give the
same conclusion, at compatible signi7cance levels, as a joint test of invariance and
non-causality. In accordance with Section 2, we take acceptance of the joint hypothesis as evidence that there is not a direct causal path from SES to incidence of the given
health condition, and take this as support for the proposition that di2erential access to
medical care and SES-linked environmental hazards are not causing incidence rates to
vary with SES.
The test results are given in Table 9. The columns of numbers in these tables are,
respectively, signi7cance levels for the invariance test with SES variables included,
the invariance test with SES variables excluded, the non-causality test conditioned on
invariance, and the joint test of invariance and non-causality. The 7nal columns in
the table give the relative risk for high versus low SES (see Section 4.3), and the
signi7cance level of a T -test of the null hypothesis that the relative risk is one.
In a majority of cases, our test for invariance is accepted. For cancer and heart disease
incidence, it is necessary to separate models for those with and without a previous
occurrence of the condition. For females, exceptions where invariance is rejected at
the 1 percent level are mortality and ADL count. Exceptions for males are cancer with
a previous occurrence, mortality, ADL count, BMI, and IADL count. The failure of
the mortality models to satisfy invariance may be related to the initial selection of a
non-institutionalized population in wave 1 of the AHEAD panel. Of course, in addition
to the question of the power of our test to detect invariance failures, our single test of
invariance across waves falls considerably short of the battery of invariance tests that

For females, the tests for non-causality of the SES variables, conditioned on a maintained hypothesis of invariance, are rejected for arthritis and psychiatric disease at the
5 percent level and for cognitive impairment and self-rated health at the one percent
level. Notably, these are all chronic or mental conditions where Medicare coverage is
limited and the cost of drugs or assistance may be substantial. For males, this test for
non-causality is rejected for cancer with a previous occurrence, heart disease with no
previous occurrence, lung disease, diabetes, cognitive impairment, and self-rated health
at the 5 percent level, and for IADL count at the one percent level. The results of
the joint test for invariance and non-causality are roughly consistent with the separate
tests. For conditions such as cancer with a previous occurrence and IADL count for
males, cognitive impairment for females, and mortality for both females and males, the
non-causality test results may be confounded by the failure of invariance.
The relative risks in Table 9 should not be interpreted causally, since again the
cases where non-causality is rejected and the relative risks are substantially di2erent
from one may be due to a common unobserved e2ect rather than a direct causal link.
The pattern of 15 relative risks exceeding one and 18 less than one suggests no broad
linkage between SES and health changes, given prior health, and the direct links that
may be indicated from the signi7cance levels (lung disease and hip fractures for males
and females, some cancers and arthritis for males) appear to be related to speci7c
features of poverty, such as smoking history and poor dwelling environment. There
are a few cases where the relative risk for high versus low SES is substantially less
than one, irrespective of statistical signi7cance, indicating an unproven link of suKcient
magnitude to warrant further investigation: lung disease, hip fracture, and the mental

diseases for females, and lung disease, diabetes, arthritis, and the mental diseases for
males. Large deviations in relative risk from one that are not statistically signi7cant
suggest that acceptance of the joint hypothesis of invariance and non-causality could
be due to low power. Notably, death shows no relation to SES, once previous health
state is controlled, and the relative risks are insigni7cantly di2erent from one. This
indicates that there are no strong direct causal links from SES to mortality, which at
the level of resolution of this study rules out di2erential access to medical treatment for
life-threatening illness. Thus, the association of SES and mortality among the elderly
appears to come primarily from variation in the prevalence of health conditions with
SES, and more weakly from indirect causal links from SES to incidence of health
conditions that increase mortality risk.
The pattern of failures of the non-causality test for mental diseases suggests the
possibility of a direct causal link related to di2erential access. Medicare limits the
scope of care for mental conditions, so ability to pay may indeed be an important
factor in eKcacy of treatments that prevent or control these conditions.
6. Tests for non-causality from health status to asset accumulation
6.1. Models of incidence
Health may in4uence asset accumulation of elderly households because of the cost
of medical treatment and related services. Medicare covers acute conditions with limited copayments, but there is the possibility of direct e2ects from uncovered costs of
drugs and living assistance. Also, health conditions may limit the consumption of other
goods, and because health status is an indicator of longevity, an individual planning
consumption and precautionary reserves over remaining life may adjust target wealth
based on altered perceptions of longevity and anticipated medical costs; see Alessie
et al. (2000), Attanasio and Hoynes (1995), Hurd (1987), Hurd and Wise (1989),
Hurd and McGarry (1997), Hurd et al. (1998a). These e2ects could induce an association of SES and health status even if there were no causal links from SES to health.
In the elderly AHEAD population, we will not observe the most likely direct causal
link from health status to accumulation among workers, the e2ect of health on current
labor market participation and productivity.
We analyze transitions in wealth from wave to wave using the framework of Section
2 and model (11) for singles and (17) and (18) for couples, with demographics,
previous wave health conditions, and current wave incidence of new health conditions
as explanatory variables. Statistically signi7cant selection coeKcients are consistent with
a direct causal link from death to a change in household wealth, but also consistent
with ecological factors that induce an association of mortality risk and SES. Total,
non-liquid, and liquid wealth are analyzed separately, with transformation (10) applied
to each component.
Appendix Table A4 gives the detailed incidence models for total, non-liquid, and liquid wealth change. As in previous studies of savings, we 7nd that most of the variance
in wealth changes over the population is not explained by observed economic variables.

40

P. Adams et al. / Journal of Econometrics 112 (2003) 3 – 56

This remains true after introduction of health conditions. We 7nd dissaving rates out
of liquid wealth, before realization of returns calculated from the S&P 500, that are
5.3 percent for couples, 4.8 percent for singles, and 6.0 percent for survivors whose
spouses have died. The dissaving rates from non-liquid wealth, again before realization
of returns, are respectively 6.9 percent, 6.3 percent, and 8.0 percent for intact couples,
singles, and survivors. The higher dissaving rates from non-liquid assets indicates that
the wealth portfolios of the elderly are rebalanced to become more liquid as they age.
These dissaving rates can be compared to an average rate of dissaving of 8.3 percent of
remaining wealth in an age 70+ population with life table survival probabilities who
consume the expected annuitized value of their wealth. 24 Then, observed dissaving
rates out of wealth are not grossly lower than would be expected with pure life cycle consumption averaging over retirement and full pooling of mortality risk. We 7nd
that low income couples and individuals have signi7cantly higher dissaving rates than
their high income counterparts, but the di2erences are not quantitatively large. Home
ownership is associated with signi7cantly less dissaving for intact couples.
The models for both singles and couples show signi7cant departures from normality
in the selection equations. The Edgeworth expansion parameters show positive skewness and smaller than normal kurtosis for female singles, negative skewness and insigni7cantly di2erent from normal kurtosis for male singles. For couples, both males
and females have negative skewness and larger than normal kurtosis. We also 7nd
signi7cant selection e2ects, with 3f = −0:49 for couples and −0:21 for singles, and
3m = −0:51 for couples and −0:89 for singles. These imply that households that survive despite unfavorable mortality risks have increased dissaving, either because of
increased cost of overcoming health problems or because households at elevated risk
spend down more rapidly. Eq. (18) includes shift parameters that modify the dependence of the wealth change disturbance on the unobserved selection e2ects in regimes
where a spouse dies. These are statistically signi7cant, and suKciently large to reverse
the direction of the intact couple selection e2ects.
Table 10 summarizes the health conditions and other covariates that are individually
signi7cant in explaining changes in wealth. For intact couples, we 7nd some acute
conditions increase saving, perhaps because they restrict consumption, or perhaps because couples conserve assets for a potential surviving spouse. For the conditions that
are associated with increased dissaving (cognitive impairment and stroke for single females), costs of maintenance associated with these conditions may be directly causal
to wealth changes.
6.2. Causality tests
Table 11 summarizes our tests for invariance and absence of direct causal links.
We test for common parameters in the wealth change models between waves 1–2
and waves 2–3, excepting intercepts and age e2ects to allow for the e2ects of sample
timing. Invariance is convincingly rejected for each demographic group and wealth
24 This calculation is made from the 1996 life tables and assumes the historical S&P rate of return from
1993 to 1997, and a 7 percent real rate of return on assets after 1997.

category, indicating that our model fails to capture the structural determinants of wealth
change. As a consequence, our non-causality tests to follow may produce rejections
due to model misspeci7cation, confounding the detection of direct causal links. A
deconstruction of the invariance failures, detailed in Appendix Table A5, shows that for
non-liquid and liquid wealth, invariance passes for demographic and health prevalence
and incidence variables, but fails for female SES variables, and for all male variables
including SES taken together. Thus, there was an unexplained regime shift before and
after wave 2 of AHEAD. Possible explanations for this are an interaction between
the criterion of non-institutionalization in the initial panel recruitment and economic
behavioral response, a wealth-linked interaction in panel retention, problems in the
measurement of wealth in the AHEAD population, which exhibits unexplained mean
reversion, or a true behavioral shift with age in a single cohort that is not captured
accurately by a model that pools wealth change observations across cohorts.

We expect that terminal medical and burial expenses, estate taxes and other estate
settlement costs, insurance payments, and bequests will have a substantial impact on the
size of a decedent’s estate and surviving spouse’s reported wealth. We easily reject the
hypothesis that the model coeKcients for intact couples and for surviving spouses are
the same, but note that measurement problems associated with a change in 7nancially
responsible respondent could also produce this rejection.
The hypothesis of no direct causality of health conditions for total wealth changes is
rejected at the 1 percent level for intact couples and singles. For non-liquid wealth, the
hypothesis is rejected for intact couples, and for liquid wealth, the hypothesis is rejected
for all demographic groups. The failure of the invariance tests, and the possibility of
confounding by persistent common factors and selection suggest that conclusions on
the health to wealth link be interpreted with caution. Appendix Table A6 deconstructs
the causality tests and identi7es the health conditions and genders responsible for rejections. The pattern of results suggest that if there is indeed a direct causal link, then
it is most likely to involve liquid wealth and health conditions that require assisted
living.
Appendix Table A7 estimates models of income change, given health conditions
and other covariates. One would not expect health status to have a signi7cant impact
on the incomes of retirees, conditioned on previous wealth, and the empirical results
are generally consistent with this expectation. We have not done formal tests of invariance or causality for income. Also included in the state vector Yt that describes
individuals are changes in home ownership status, and dwelling and neighborhood conditions. We estimate incidence models for these components; results are in Appendix
Table A8.

7. Simulation of life courses under counterfactual conditions
7.1. The simulation experiment
For policy analysis of interventions that alter delivery or cost of medical services,
or retirement 7nancing, one would like to trace through the direct and indirect causal
links between wealth, health, and mortality. If Markov models of the sort developed
in Sections 2–6 satisfy the required invariance properties, then they can be used to
simulate the impacts of these interventions on the life courses of a synthetic population.
In this section, we develop such a simulation analysis, and apply it to illustrative
interventions. Because we have not uniformly accepted invariance, and in a number
of cases 7nd associations that may be either direct causal links or hidden common
factors, this simulation analysis assumes more than our estimates support. It should be
interpreted only as an exercise that shows how a model of this general structure might
be used in a policy application to unravel the dynamics of co-morbidities and forecast
condition-speci7c morbidity and mortality, and life expectancy.
We simulate the life courses of a synthetic population in which heads of household
are initially age 70 –74. To synthesize this population, we start from the 1612 households in AHEAD wave 1 whose heads are white and age 70 –74. Using the SES and
demographic variables for each household in this subsample, we make 10 Monte Carlo
draws from the prevalence models in Section 4 to create synthetic initial health pro7les
for the household head, and spouse if present. This gives an initial synthetic sample of
16 120 households. We then create life courses for the members of each household by
drawing recursively from the Markov incidence models in Sections 5 and 6, adjusted to
annual transitions using (9) to approximate the probabilities of moving to new states.
We 7rst consider a base scenario (S0) in which initial prevalence and incidence
transitions are given by our models estimated on the AHEAD data. We note that the
simulation outcomes can be expected to di2er to some degree from the cross-cohort
patterns found in AHEAD, because the distribution of conditions at ages 70 –74 will
di2er from the distributions of prevalence that actually prevailed for older individuals
in AHEAD when they were ages 70 –74. They should also di2er to some degree from
the actual experience that the age 70 –74 cohort in AHEAD will have through the
remainder of their lives, because the simulation cannot anticipate the realized future
distribution of exogenous variables, and because our models do not allow for drift in
disease incidence or condition-speci7c mortality hazards that will result from changes in
medical care. Historically, these drifts have been very signi7cant, reducing morbidities
and increasing life expectancies. If these trends continue, then the baseline simulations
will underestimate actual survival experience.
We next consider two stylized policy interventions. The 7rst alternative scenario
(S1) examines the impact on life courses of the introduction of a hypothetical medical
treatment that cures diabetes, for example by stem cell and immune system therapy
that rejuvenates the pancreas for both type I and type II diabetics. In this scenario, we
assume that prevalence of diabetes at the start of the simulated panel drops to zero, and
that there is zero incidence of this condition as the cohort ages. We do not alter the
historical prevalence of conditions associated with diabetes. Thus, we assume that the

44

P. Adams et al. / Journal of Econometrics 112 (2003) 3 – 56

historical impact on individuals of type I diabetes, notably increased prevalence of heart
disease and stroke at age 70 –74, is not altered. The second alternative scenario (S2)
examines the impact on life courses of reducing the entire population from their current
socioeconomic status to our de7nition of a low-SES individual: bottom quartile for
wealth and income, less than a high school education, and a poor or fair neighborhood
and dwelling. This alternative is obviously hypothetical, and is not even a stylized
approximation to any real policy alternative. However, it provides an extreme in which
the interactions of health and SES are permitted maximum play, giving an upper bound
on the e2ect that SES could possibly have on health outcomes, and providing a 7nger
exercise that tests the plausibility of our model system.
7.2. Baseline simulation
Table 12 summarizes the survival probabilities and prevalence of health conditions
among survivors in the simulated cohort as it ages, under the baseline scenario (S0),
the no-diabetes scenario (S1), and the low-SES scenario (S2). Keeping in mind that
we expect the simulation model to di2er from the historical cross-cohort record in
AHEAD, the success of this model in plausibly mimicking observed conditions in the
AHEAD population can be judged by comparing the results for scenario S0 with life
table survival probabilities. Life expectancy for a cohort of white females aged 70 –74
is 13.15 years from the 1996 Life Tables and 14.36 years in our baseline simulation.
The life table probability of survival for 15 years for the aged 70 –74 cohort is 0.535,
while the corresponding survival probability in the simulation model is 0.500. For
white males, the life expectancy at age 70 is 11.31 years from the Life Tables and
10.81 years from the S0 simulation. The 15-year survival probability is 0.381 from
the life tables and 0.279 from the simulation model. Thus, relative to the life tables,
the simulation model under-predicts female mortality and over-predicts male mortality.
The comparison of annual mortality rates for white females given in Fig. 5 indicates that
actual AHEAD mortality experience was more favorable than the life tables between
waves 1 and 2, presumably due to selection in panel recruitment, and very close to the
life tables between waves 2 and 3. Then, the baseline simulation appears to reproduce
relatively accurately the cross-cohort survival experience in AHEAD. This provides a
reality check for the simulation model, but also suggests that if the survival experience
of a current cohort di2ers from the historical cross-cohort pattern, then the simulation
model will miss the drift in mortality hazards that a single cohort will face in the
future.
A comparison of prevalence rates for various health conditions among survivors of
various ages can be made between AHEAD at wave 1, given in Table 4, and the
baseline simulation in Table 12. There are issues of comparability in the de7nition
of prevalence for some conditions, but the pattern that emerges is that the simulated
prevalences are systematically higher than the historical prevalences, and increasingly so
at older ages. For example, for white females aged 80 –84, the historical and simulated
prevalence rates are 0.168 versus 0.219 for cancer, 0.361 versus 0.442 for heart disease,
and 0.338 versus 0.437 for cognitive impairment. One possible explanation for this
is that the links from morbidity to mortality are stronger than the mortality model

detects, perhaps because of under-reporting of health conditions that arise prior to
death, so that the simulation model underestimates the selection e2ect of mortality
that reduces prevalence among survivors. A second possible explanation is that there
is strong unobserved heterogeneity in susceptibility to various health conditions, so
that cumulative prevalence is overestimated by our 7rst-order Markov models which
describe prevalence for most conditions as the result of one or more positives in a
series of Bernoulli trials. It is possible to test for persistent unobserved heterogeneity
by asking whether the frequency of a negative for a condition between waves 1 and 3
of AHEAD is the product of the frequencies of a negative between successive waves.
When we do this, we do not 7nd persistent unobserved heterogeneity. However, the
power of the test is modest, and it is possible that even a limited degree of persistent
unobserved heterogeneity is enough to explain the di2erences in AHEAD and the
simulation.
A comparison is given in Table 13 between median wealth and income by age in the
AHEAD panel and in the baseline simulation. The historical cross-cohort data shows
sharply declining wealth and income with age, and a less liquid portfolio with age,
re4ecting strong cohort e2ects as well as life cycle and selection e2ects. The simulation
results, which exclude cohort e2ects, nevertheless show even more sharply declining
wealth with age, and a strong shift toward a more liquid portfolio mix. If the simulation
is correctly describing portfolio balance of a single cohort over its life course, then there
is a strong cross-cohort e2ect, with older cohorts starting from retirement portfolios that
are more heavily invested in housing equity and other nonliquid forms. The simulated
semi-interquartile range is narrower than its historical counterpart, particularly for older
households. In the simulation, variability (de7ned as the ratio of the semi-interquartile
range divided by the median) falls with age, whereas in the historical cross-cohort
data variability rises with age. This suggests that in addition to cross-cohort e2ects,
that there may be persistent heterogeneity in savings behavior that is not captured in
our model.
7.3. Alternative scenarios
Table 12 gives the survival probabilities and prevalences of various health conditions under our alternative no-diabetes scenario (S1) and the low-SES scenario (S2).
In the no-diabetes simulation, the direct mortality risk from diabetes, and the incidence
of co-morbidities with diabetes are eliminated, although our simulated population will
display elevated prevalence of heart disease and stroke at age 70 among former diabetics. Life expectancy at age 70 under this scenario increases from 14.36 to 14.69
years for females, and from 10.81 to 11.26 years for males. These rates imply in turn
that a former diabetic’s life expectancy increases by 2.72 years for females and 3.32
years for males. Other health condition prevalences that fall in the absence of diabetes are heart disease, stroke, cognitive impairment, ADL and IADL impairment, and
poor/fair self-rated health. While reduction in mortality risk from one source must as a
matter of accounting eventually lead to more deaths from competing risks, there are
no substantial movements in prevalences of the remaining health conditions.

The alternative low-SES scenario reduces our entire age 70 simulated population to
the bottom quartile for wealth and income, gives them less than a high school education, and places them in a dwelling in poor condition in an unsafe neighborhood.
They are kept in this low-SES status for the remainder of their lives; i.e., there is no
opportunity in this simulation for households to escape low SES by a lucky change
in wealth or income. However, our population displays the patterns of prevalence of
health conditions established in their earlier lives with their historical SES status. This
scenario is quite arti7cial, but it demonstrates the holistic e2ect on the broad spectrum
of health conditions of low SES. Life expectancies at age 70 in this scenario drop
dramatically, from 14.36 to 12.27 years for females, and from 10.81 to 9.56 years

50

for males. Prevalences of cancer, heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, arthritis, incontinence, hip fractures, cognitive impairment, psychiatric disease, and depression all
increase sharply, as do the number of ADL and IADL impairments. Conditions whose
prevalence is not a2ected substantially by low SES are stroke, high blood pressure,
and falls. These results indicate that if the associations of SES and incidence of health
conditions that we 7nd in AHEAD were entirely the result of direct causal links from
wealth to health, then the protective e2ect of the prevailing pattern of higher SES
is 1.26 –2.08 years of added life expectancy. Thus, our 7ndings that for most health
conditions the evidence is against direct causal links from SES to incidence do not
appear to rule out a substantial cumulative e2ect of SES over conditions and time that
induce a noticeable SES gradient in mortality. Given our speci7c 7ndings against direct
causal links from SES to incidence of acute conditions and mortality, the most obvious
possible source for this gradient are SES-linked di2erences in genetic susceptibility
and behavior.
We have emphasized that our stylized, hypothetical policy intervention and the
changes in health they produce over the life course are strictly illustrative, and should
be interpreted with great caution. These 7nger exercises cannot be used to draw conclusions about any real policy initiatives. This is particularly true since we have included
within our model system components that fail the invariance tests that we have emphasized must be met by a valid policy model, and because in many cases our models
display some wealth or income gradients for incidence that we cannot with our statistical methods identify as the sole result of direct causal links. While most of these
e2ects are not statistically signi7cant, it is possible that in a larger or longer panel with
greater statistical power, they will prove to be signi7cant. Then, it is essential to turn
to the more advanced statistical methods of Heckman (2001) and others to identify the
direct causal components in these incidence associations, and improve the models to
achieve invariance. Only after this is done, and realistically detailed policy scenarios
are considered, could policy makers take our model system seriously as a policy tool.
However, we believe that our results do demonstrate that it would be useful for health
policy analysis to utilize a system of invariant models with a causal chain structure
to simulate policy impacts, in a framework that takes into account indirect impacts,
competing hazards, and direct causal links between SES and health. We believe that
analysis of the broad sweep of co-morbidities and wealth e2ects over the life course
is an important complement to the disease-centric orientation of many medical and
epidemiological studies of health outcomes.
8. Summary and speculations for further research
This paper has used innovations in health conditions and in wealth in the AHEAD
panel to carry out tests for the absence of direct causal links from SES to health, and
from health conditions to wealth. By advancing beyond the detection of association
to a framework in which there is some possibility of detecting the absence of causal
links, this paper provides a methodology that may be useful in winnowing the list
of possible direct causal mechanisms, or delimiting their domain of action. For the

P. Adams et al. / Journal of Econometrics 112 (2003) 3 – 56

AHEAD sample, a panel of U.S. elderly age 70 and older in 1993, we conclude
generally that for mortality and for acute, sudden-onset diseases, the hypothesis of no
causal link from SES is accepted, and for incidence of mental problems the hypothesis
is rejected. The results for chronic and degenerative diseases are mixed. We generally
reject the hypothesis of no direct causal link from health conditions to total wealth
changes, but cannot rule out confounding of the test by invariance failures.
The pattern of results suggests that incidence of acute, sudden onset health conditions, conditioned on existing health conditions, does not exhibit a signi7cant SES
gradient, while incidence of some mental, chronic, and degenerative conditions appear
to have an association to SES due to some combination of direct causal links and
common unobserved behavioral or genetic factors. The results suggest that there may
be an SES gradient in seeking treatment for the second class of conditions, which
may in4uence detection, or for maintaining preventative regimens that may maintain
some conditions below the reporting thresholds. Our 7ndings are not inconsistent with
the possibility that for mental and chronic illnesses where the acute care procedures
covered by Medicare are often inapplicable, ability to pay may be a causal factor in
seeking and receiving treatment. We do not 7nd systematic persuasive associations of
health conditions and changes in total wealth, except for surviving spouses. Problems
in measuring and modeling wealth changes suggest caution in concluding from these
results that there is generally no direct causal link from health conditions to wealth
changes.
We emphasize that our results apply only to elderly individuals in the U.S., where
Medicare and Medicaid programs limit out-of-pocket medical costs, particularly for
acute care, and where retired status eliminates a possible direct causal link from health
status to ability to work. Further, in an elderly population, common factors may be
manifest in prior health conditions and economic status, so they have little impact once
incidence is conditioned on prior state. Our results provide no evidence on the nature
of the causal links at younger ages, during the stages of life where association of health
and wealth is emerging as a consequence of some causal structure.
Future waves of the AHEAD (HRS) panel will allow the hypotheses of invariance
and non-causality to be tested with greater power. This will particularly be the case
when full tracking of decedents, and determination of cause of death from medical
records, become part of the data. It seems likely that some of the associations we have
found between changes in health and wealth will survive more detailed analysis, and
that suitably de7ned natural or designed experiments are likely to be needed to fully
unravel the causal structure underlying these associations.
The modeling structure used in this paper is parametric, and the high dimensionality
of the vector of possible explanatory variables and the relatively limited information
contained in binomial outcomes in the AHEAD panel make it diKcult to move to a
more robust non-parametric analysis. However, we have been 4exible in specifying the
variable transformations that appear in our models, and we interpret our analysis as
conforming in spirit, if hardly in fact, to a method of sieves approach to non-parametric
analysis. One of the major limitations of our models, which would be likely to lead
them to fail invariance tests in situations where a sharp test is possible, is that they
do not account adequately for the multiple risk structure of health conditions and its

52

implications for the duration patterns that can emerge, particularly over the relatively
long intervals between waves. Some outcomes, such as mortality and non-fatal heart
disease, are competing risks, while others, like diabetes and heart conditions, are complementary risks. For future research, we are investigating hidden Markov models
in which a latent vector of propensities for all health and SES conditions follows
a 7rst-order Markov process, conditioned on demographic state, and all possible causal
links across the components of this latent vector appear in the model. Given thresholds that trigger observed states, this model provides a consistent but computationally
demanding data generation process for the vector of Markov states month-by-month.
Within this model, it is possible to carry out joint tests for the absence of classes of
causal links. The next wave of this research, incorporating wave 4 of AHEAD, will
include full development of 4exible multiple-risk duration models.
