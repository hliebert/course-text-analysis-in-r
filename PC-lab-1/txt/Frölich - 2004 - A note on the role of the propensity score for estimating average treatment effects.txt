ABSTRACT
Hahn [Hahn, J. (1998). On the role of the propensity score in efﬁcient semiparametric estimation of average treatment effects. Econometrica 66:315–331] derived
the semiparametric efﬁciency bounds for estimating the average treatment effect
(ATE) and the average treatment effect on the treated (ATET). The variance of
ATET depends on whether the propensity score is known or unknown. Hahn
attributes this to ‘‘dimension reduction.’’ In this paper, an alternative explanation
is given: Knowledge of the propensity score improves upon the estimation of the
distribution of the confounding variables.

1. INTRODUCTION
Propensity score matching is a technique widely used in biometrics, econometrics and other social sciences to estimate average treatment effects of medical
treatments, active labour market programmes, training programmes etc. Its popularity stems from the fact that, instead of controlling for all confounding factors X,
it sufﬁces to control for a one-dimensional propensity score (the conditional
probability of treatment receipt) to remove all selection bias (Rosenbaum and
Rubin, 1983). This reduces the dimension of the estimation problem substantially.
However, in many applications the propensity score is unknown and needs to be
estimated. This gave rise to a debate on how much efﬁciency is lost by not knowing
the true propensity score. Hahn (1998) derived the semiparametric efﬁciency bounds
for the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect on the treated. He
found that the variance bound for the average treatment effect (ATE) is completely
unaffected by knowledge of the propensity score, whereas knowing the propensity
score reduces the variance for the average effect on the treated (ATET). This leads
to the question, why these bounds are affected differently. Hahn argues that the
reduction in the variance of the treatment effect on the treated ‘‘can be solely
attributed to the ‘‘dimension reduction’’ feature of the propensity score.’’
This paper provides a different explanation for the role of the propensity score.
It argues that the reason for why knowledge of the propensity score affects the variance bound is not the dimension reduction, but the information it provides for estimating the distribution function of the confounding variables X in the treated
subpopulation. This distribution function FXjtreated is used as weighting function
for the ATET. When the propensity score is unknown, FXjtreated is identiﬁed by the
X observations of the treated individuals; non-treated individuals are not informative for estimating the distribution of X among the treated. On the other hand, if
the propensity score is known, also the non-treated individuals are helpful for estimating FXjtreated , because FXjuntreated and FXjtreated are related via the propensity score.
The variance of the ATE is unaffected, because it is obtained through weighting
by the distribution of X in the full population, which in any case is estimated from all
the treated and the non-treated observations together.

2. EFFICIENCY BOUNDS AND THE PROPENSITY SCORE
Deﬁne Yi0 ; Yi1 as the potential outcomes of individual i: Yi0 is the outcome that
individual i would realize if not receiving the treatment and Yi1 the outcome if receiving the treatment. The average causal impact of the treatment can be measured by
the average treatment effect

where Di indicates whether an individual received treatment (Di ¼ 1) or not (Di ¼ 0).
Whereas a measures the impact of treatment for the full population, aT represents
the effect for the subpopulation of individuals who actually received treatment. If
treatment is unconfounded (Rubin, 1974), Y 0 ; Y 1 ?? DjX and the treatment effects
are identiﬁed as
Z
a ¼ ðm1 ðxÞ  m0 ðxÞÞ  dFX
Z
ð3Þ
aT ¼ ðm1 ðxÞ  m0 ðxÞÞ  dFXjD¼1 ;
where md ðxÞ ¼ E½Y j X ¼ x; D ¼ d is the conditional mean function, fX ¼ dFX is the
density of X in the population and fXjD¼1 ¼ dFXjD¼1 is the density of X in the treated
subpopulation.a,b
Since nonparametric estimation of md ðxÞ can be difﬁcult in ﬁnite samples if the
dimension of X is high, Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) suggested to reduce the
dimension of the estimation problem by making use of the balancing property of
the propensity score: The unconfoundedness assumption implies Y 0 ; Y 1 ?? DjpðXÞ,
where pðxÞ ¼ P ðD ¼ 1 j X ¼ xÞ is the propensity score and the average treatment
effects are also identiﬁed as
Z
a ¼ ðm1 ðrÞ  m0 ðrÞÞ  dFp ðrÞ
Z
ð4Þ
aT ¼ ðm1 ðrÞ  m0 ðrÞÞ  dFpjD¼1 ðrÞ;
where md ðrÞ ¼ E½Y j pðXÞ ¼ r; D ¼ d is the mean outcome conditional on the
propensity score, Fp is the distribution of pðxÞ in the population and FpjD¼1 is the
distribution of the propensity score in the treated subpopulation. Since the propensity score pðxÞ is one-dimensional, nonparametric estimation of md ðrÞ is usually
substantially less demanding than nonparametric estimation of md ðxÞ. In this sense,
propensity score matching circumvents the dimensionality problem of nonparametric regression on X and is therefore widely used in applied evaluation studies.
On the other hand, the propensity score is often unknown and estimation of the
average treatment effects must make do with an estimated propensity score.
To analyze the role of the propensity score, Hahn (1998) derived the semiparametric efﬁciency bounds for known and for unknown propensity score. To make the
following discussion more intuitive, the variance bounds are henceforth scaled by the
number of observations, i.e., divided by n0 þ n1 , to reﬂect the approximate variance
for a given number of observations. (n1 , n0 are the number of treated=non-treated
A further condition for identiﬁcation is that SuppðX j D ¼ 1Þ ¼ SuppðX j D ¼ 0Þ, or
equivalently that 0 < pðxÞ < 1 8x 2 SuppðXÞ, where pðxÞ  P ðD ¼ 1 j X ¼ xÞ is the
propensity score.

the ‘‘dimension reducing’’ property of the propensity score. This interpretation,

while it enters aT through two different channels, knowledge of the propensity score
affects a differently than aT .
An alternative explanation to why knowing the propensity score is useful for aT
but not for a is developed below. The basic insight is that knowing the propensity
score helps in estimating the distribution FXjD¼1 whereas it does not help for estimating FX . The central difference between a and aT is that a is identiﬁed in (3) by
weighting m1 ðxÞ  m0 ðxÞ by the distribution FX , whereas aT is obtained by weighting
by FXjD¼1 .
Without knowledge of the propensity score, the distribution FXjD¼1 can be
estimated by the empirical distribution function of X among the n1 treated individuals. The X values of the non-treated observations contain no information about
FXjD¼1 . However, when the propensity score is known, in addition also the n0
non-treated individuals become informative for estimating the distribution of X
among the treated, because the distributions FXjD¼0 and FXjD¼1 are related through
the propensity score by Bayes’ theorem:
fXjD¼1 ðxÞ PðD ¼ 1Þ
pðxÞ
¼
:
1  pðxÞ fXjD¼0 ðxÞ PðD ¼ 0Þ

ð8Þ

The propensity score enables using the X observations of one subpopulation (the
non-treated) to estimate the distribution of X in a different subpopulation (the treated). Hence all n0 þ n1 observations can be used to estimate FXjD¼1 . On the other
hand, the distribution FX is in any case identiﬁed by all n0 þ n1 observations, regardless of knowledge on the propensity score.
By this explanation it is also obvious why the variance bounds (5) and (7) coincide in the case of random treatment assignment (pðxÞ ¼ p), and why (6) does not
Hahn (1998, Theorem 3). With treatment randomly assigned, the distribution of X
is identical among the treated and the non-treated: FXjD¼1 ¼ FXjD¼0 . If it is known
that treatment was randomly assigned, estimation of a and aT can proceed by estimating m1 ðxÞ and m0 ðxÞ separately from the respective subsamples and weighting
^ 0 ðxÞ by the distribution of X in the full sample. If it is unknown that
^ 1 ðxÞ  m

treatment assignment was random, only the n1 treated observations can be used

for weighting m
This is reﬂected in the variance bounds (5) to (7). Each expression consists of
three terms: The ﬁrst term in each bound captures the variance due to estimating
m0 ðxÞ, re-weighted by the density of X in the relevant population. This term vanishes
at rate 1=n0 since only the n0 non-treated observations are informative for estimating
m0 . Analogously, the second term in each bound represents the variance due to
estimating m1 ðxÞ, which vanishes at rate 1=n1 . The third term stems from estimating
the distribution FX in (5) and FXjD¼1 in (6) and (7). This term vanishes either at rate
1=ðn0 þ n1 Þ or 1=n1 . If treatment assignment is random, the ﬁrst term and also
the second term is identical in all three bounds. The third term differs only in the
scaling factor. In (5), for estimating a, the third term is scaled by 1=ðn0 þ n1 Þ since
the full sample is used for estimating FX . For aT , the third term is also scaled by
1=ðn0 þ n1 Þ if it is known that assignment was random (7), and by 1=n1 if this is
unknown (6). For example, if random assignment is with probability p ¼ 0:5, this
variance component reduces by half when random-assignment is known, since the

number of observations that are useful for estimating FXjD¼1 increases from n1 to
2n1 .
In the case of non-random assignment (pðxÞ 6¼ p), the bounds (6) and (7) for aT
still differ only in the third term. Since the ﬁrst two terms are unaffected, the only
channel through which knowledge of the propensity score can inﬂuence the variance
of aT is through the estimation of FXjD¼1 . As in the case of random assignment, this
third variance term is scaled by 1=n1 when the propensity score is unknown, and it is
scaled by 1=ðn0 þ n1 Þ when it is known, because treated as well as non-treated observations contribute then to the identiﬁcation of FXjD¼1 . However, the non-treated
observations are now less ‘‘efﬁcient’’ in estimating FXjD¼1 , because the density
mass of the non-treated observations may be concentrated in different regions than
the mass of the treated observations. This is embodied in the correction term
fXjD¼1 =fX in the third term in (7).
This relationship between the propensity score and the estimation of FXjD¼1
becomes even more apparent when examining the variance bounds for estimating
the distribution function FXjD¼1 ðxÞ. With unknown propensity score the scaled variance bound for estimating FXjD¼1 ðxÞ is

(Proof available on request.)
These variance bounds have the same structure as the third terms in (6) and (7):
If the propensity score is unknown, the variance (9) vanishes at rate 1=n1 , whereas
it vanishes at rate 1=ðn0 þ n1 Þ for known propensity score (10), because the nontreated observations assist in estimating FXjD¼1 , with the same correction factor
fXjD¼1 =fX as in (7).
Hence it is this additional information on FXjD¼1 , and not any dimension
reduction, that makes knowledge of the propensity score informative for the average
treatment effect on the treated aT and ancillary for the estimation of the average
treatment effect a.
