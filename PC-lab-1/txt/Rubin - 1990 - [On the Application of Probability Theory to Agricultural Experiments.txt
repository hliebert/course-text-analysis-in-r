COMPLETELYRANDOMIZEDEXPERIMENT
I aminfullagreement
withScheffe's
(1956)descriptionofNeyman'smathematical
modelas correspondingto the completely
randomized
experiment,
and I
also agreewithDabrowskaand Speedthattheexplicit
suggestion
to use the urnmodelto physically
assign
varietiesto plots is absent.This latterconclusion,
however,
is highly
influenced
byNeyman'sattribution
of physically
randomized
experiments
to Fisherand
his followers
(Neyman,1935,page 109):
Owingto theworkofR. A. Fisher,"Student"and
theirfollowers,
it is hardlypossibleto add anyconcernthingessentialto thepresentknowledge
ing local experiments.... One of the most
oftheEnglishSchoolis
important
achievements
their method of planning field experiments
knownas themethodofRandomizedBlocksand
LatinSquares.
The Neyman(1935,page 112) quotationgivenin the
also attributes
Dabrowskaand Speed introduction
to Fisher.Furthermore,
Reid (1982,
randomization
page45) quotesNeymanto thiseffect:
On one occasion,whensomeoneperceivedhim

The latterpointis
dueto Fisher,and I consideritas oneofthemost
valuableofFisher'sachievements."
If thesestatements
fromNeymanhad been replaced
byclaimsofpriority
basedon his 1923paper,itwould
have been difficult
forme not to have acceptedthe
positionthathe had independently
envisioned
physicallyrandomized
experiments
even withouta translationthatusedtheword"randomization."
Certainly,
theidea ofrandomassignment
seemsto
havebeen"intheair"in 1923."Student"(1923,pages

477

281-282)writes:"Ifnowtheplotshadbeenrandomly

placed .. ." and ". .. we are as accurate as if we had

devotedtwicethe area to plotsrandomly

Also,Fisherand MacKenzie(1923,page473) write:
Furthermore,
if all the plots were undifferentiated,as ifthenumbershad beenmixedup and
written

ofeachofthetwoparts[between

Nearlyforty
