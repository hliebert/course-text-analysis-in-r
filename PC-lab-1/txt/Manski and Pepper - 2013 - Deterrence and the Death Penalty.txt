Abstract

Objectives Researchers have used repeated cross sectional observations of homicide
rates and sanctions to examine the deterrent effect of the adoption and implementation of
death penalty statutes. The empirical literature, however, has failed to achieve consensus.
A fundamental problem is that the outcomes of counterfactual policies are not observable.
Hence, the data alone cannot identify the deterrent effect of capital punishment. This paper
asks how research should proceed. We seek to make transparent how assumptions shape
inference.
Methods We study the identifying power of relatively weak assumptions restricting
variation in treatment response across places and time. We perform empirical analysis
using state-level data in the United States in 1975 and 1977.
Results The results are findings of partial identification that bound the deterrent effect of
capital punishment. Under the weakest restrictions, there is substantial ambiguity: we
cannot rule out the possibility that having a death penalty statute substantially increases or
decreases homicide. This ambiguity is reduced when we impose stronger assumptions, but
inferences are sensitive to the maintained restrictions.
Conclusions Imposing certain assumptions implies that adoption of a death penalty
statute increases homicide, but other assumptions imply that the death penalty deters it.
Thus, society at large can draw strong conclusions only if there is a consensus favoring
particular assumptions. Without such a consensus, data on sanctions and murder rates
cannot settle the debate about deterrence. However, data combined with weak assumptions
can bound and focus the debate.

Introduction
Researchers have long used data on homicide rates and sanctions to examine the deterrent
effect of capital punishment. There is now a large body of work addressing this controversial question, yet the literature has failed to achieve consensus on even the most basic
matters. Donohue and Wolfers (2005), who review a set of recent studies, provide a
striking illustration. They find that a seemingly trivial change to the model estimated by
Dezhbakhsh et al. (2003) ‘‘flips the sign of the original estimates: instead of saving
eighteen lives, each execution leads to eighteen lives lost.’’
Numerous shortcomings of the research were documented over 30 years ago in the
report of the National Research Council (NRC) Panel on Research on Deterrent and
Incapacitative Effects (Blumstein et al. 1978). These problems persist in more recent work.
A fundamental difficulty is that the outcomes of counterfactual policies are unobservable.
Data alone cannot reveal what the homicide rate in a state without (with) a death penalty
would have been had the state (not) adopted a death penalty statute. Here, as always when
analyzing treatment response, data must be combined with assumptions to enable inference
on counterfactual outcomes. Hence, research confronts the selection problem.
If available data alone cannot reveal the deterrent effects of capital punishment, how
should research proceed? It is tempting to impose assumptions strong enough to yield a
definitive finding. When this is achieved, a deterrent effect is said to be point-identified.
Researchers often recognize that strong assumptions may have little foundation, but they
apply them nonetheless. They may defend their strong assumptions as necessary to
‘‘provide answers.’’ However, strong assumptions may be inaccurate, yielding flawed and
conflicting conclusions. One of us has cautioned against the imposition of untenable strong
assumptions as follows (Manski 2003, p. 1):
The Law of Decreasing Credibility: The credibility of inference decreases with the
strength of the assumptions maintained.
We have seen this repeatedly in the empirical literature on the death penalty.
With this in mind, we study inference under various relatively weak assumptions that may
possess greater credibility. The assumptions we study do not point-identify deterrent effects, but
they do partially identify them, yielding bounds rather than point estimates. Analysis of partial
identification of treatment effects has developed and been applied over the past 20 years,
beginning with Manski (1990) and continuing through our present work. See Manski (2003,
2007) for textbook expositions. Some applications include Manski and Nagin (1998), Manski
and Pepper (2000), Pepper (2000), Blundell et al. (2007), and Gundersen et al. (2012).
The basic insight of partial identification analysis is that identification need not be an all
or nothing undertaking. Available data and credible assumptions may lead to partial
conclusions. Some may find this ambiguity frustrating and be tempted to impose strong
assumptions in order to provide definitive answers. We caution against such a reaction.
Imposing strong but untenable assumptions cannot truly resolve the problem of inference on the deterrent effects of capital punishment. The NRC Panel on Research on

Deterrent and Incapacitative Effects recognized this when it concluded that ‘‘research on
this topic is not likely to produce findings that will or should have much influence on
policymakers’’ (Blumstein et al. 1978, p. 63). The lesson of past research is that researchers
and policymakers must cope with ambiguity.
To demonstrate partial identification analysis in a relatively simple setting, this paper
considers the problem of drawing inferences on the deterrent effects of death penalty
statutes using data from repeated cross sections of states.1 We focus on the years following
the 1972 Supreme Court case Furman vs. Georgia, which resulted in a de facto moratorium
on the application of the death penalty, and the 1976 case Gregg vs. Georgia, which ruled
that the death penalty could be applied subject to certain criteria. We examine the effect of
death penalty statutes on the national homicide rate in 2 years: 1975, the last full year of
the federal moratorium on the death penalty, and 1977, the first full year after the moratorium was lifted. In 1975 the death penalty was illegal throughout the country, and in 1977
thirty-two states had legal death penalty statutes. For each state and each year, we observe
the homicide rate and whether the death penalty is legal.
Table 1 displays the homicide rate per 100,000 residents in 1975 and 1977 in the states
that did and did not legalize the death penalty after the Gregg decision. The former are the
‘‘treated’’ states and the latter are the ‘‘untreated’’ ones. Here and throughout the paper, we
include the District of Columbia and regard it as equivalent to a state. When computing
averages across states, we weight each state by its population. The thirty-two states with
legal death penalty statutes in 1977 contained seventy percent of the total population.
The data in the table may be used to compute three simple estimates of the effect of
death penalty statutes on the national homicide rate. A ‘‘before-and-after’’ analysis compares homicide rates in the treated states in 1975 and 1977, yielding the estimate -0.6
(9.7–10.3). Contemporaneous comparison of 1977 homicide rates in the treated and
untreated states yields the estimate 2.8 (9.7–6.9). The difference-in-difference (DID)
estimate compares the time-series changes in homicide rates in the treated and untreated
states, yielding the estimate 0.5 [(9.7–10.3) - (6.9–8.0)].2
These three estimates yield different empirical findings. Given certain assumptions,
each appropriately measures the effect on death penalty statutes on the national homicide
rate. However, the assumptions that justify this interpretation differ across estimates.
Moreover, one may think that none of the requisite assumptions is credible.
In section ‘‘Average treatment effects and the selection problem’’, we formally define
the empirical question and the selection problem. Section ‘‘Polar approaches to inference’’
presents two polar approaches to inference. At one pole, deterrent effects are point-identified under strong assumptions needed to justify the three estimates described above. At
the other, they are partially identified using only the data and an a priori bound on the
maximum possible value of the mean counterfactual homicide rate. No other assumptions
are imposed to address the selection problem.

DID estimates have been reported in numerous policy analyses, including evaluations of the death penalty.
For example, Dezhbakhsh and Shepherd (2006) used the federal moratorium of the 1970s as a ‘‘judicial
experiment.’’ More broadly, they used data from 1960–2000 to compare murder rates immediately before
and after changes in death penalty laws. They concluded that the death penalty has a substantial deterrent
effect on homicides. Examining the same questions using the same data, Donohue and Wolfers (2005)
concluded that there is no evidence that the death penalty deters homicides.

Section ‘‘Middle-ground assumptions’’ applies new results on partial identification
developed in our companion technical paper (Manski and Pepper 2012). These results
exploit the variation of homicide rates and death penalty status in repeated cross sections of
states to explore middle ground assumptions. By successively adding stronger assumptions
and determining their identifying power, our analysis makes transparent how assumptions
shape inferences about the effect of capital punishment on homicide.
The assumptions that we consider restrict the potential variation of treatment response
or treatment effects over time and/or across states. Under the weakest assumptions, there is
considerable ambiguity: we cannot rule out the possibility that the death penalty substantially increases or decreases the mean homicide rate across states. This ambiguity is
reduced by imposing stronger assumptions, but inferences are highly sensitive. Given the
available data, imposing certain assumptions implies that the death penalty increases
homicide but other assumptions imply that the death penalty deters it.
This paper does not provide measures of statistical precision when presenting our
findings on average treatment effects (ATEs). That is, we view the states in 1975 and 1977
as constituting the population of interest, rather than as realizations from some sampling
process. One reason we do this is expositional. We want to focus attention on the identification problem arising from the unobservability of counterfactual outcomes. Statistical
precision of estimates is a second-order concern relative to this problem.
Another reason is that measurement of statistical precision requires specification of a
sampling process that generates the data, but we are unsure what type of sampling process
would be reasonable to assume. Existing methods for computing confidence intervals in partial
identification analysis assume that the data are a random sample drawn from an infinite population; see, for example, Imbens and Manski (2004) and Chernozhukov et al. (2007). This
sampling assumption does not seem natural when considering states as units of observation.

Average Treatment Effects and the Selection Problem
We consider the problem of learning the effect of death penalty statutes on the national
homicide rate. This is the population-wide ATE
ATEd  E½Yd ð1Þ  E½Yd ð0Þ

ð1Þ

Here there are two mutually exclusive treatments: treatment t = 1 denotes a state sanctions
regime that includes the presence of a death penalty statute and t = 0 denotes one without
such a statute. Defining the treatment to be the presence or absence of a death penalty
statute is a representation of actual sanctions policy intended to simplify analysis. While
this comparison addresses a well-defined question, the resulting analysis cannot reveal the
mechanisms by which the statute impacts crime. One might like to differentiate treatments
by the specifics of the death penalty statute enacted, the way it is implemented, and by the
nature of the non-capital sanctions that a state has in place.

123

J Quant Criminol (2013) 29:123–141

127

The outcome Yd(1) denotes the homicide rate if a state were to have a death penalty
statute, Yd(0) denotes the analogous outcome if the state were not to have a death penalty
statute, and d indicates whether the year is 1975 or 1977 (=0 if 1975, = 1 if 1977). ATEd
expresses how the national homicide rate in year d would differ if all states were to have a
death penalty statute versus what would occur if all states had a death penalty moratorium.
We also consider inference on the effect of death penalty statutes on homicide in
groups of states with specified observed characteristics. Let X denote these characteristics. Then the objective is to learn the group-specific average treatment effect
ATEdX : E[Yd(1)|X] - E[Yd(0)|X].
Notice that for each state j and year d, there are two potential outcomes, Yjd(1) and
Yjd(0). The outcome Yjd(1) is counterfactual for all states that did not have a death penalty
statute in year d, while Yjd(0) is counterfactual for all states that did have a death penalty.
The observed murder rate is Yjd = Yjd(1)Zjd ? Yjd(0)(1 - Zjd), where Zjd = 1 denotes
that state j has a death penalty statute in year d and Zjd = 0 otherwise.
The fact that the data only reveal one of the two mutually exclusive outcomes constitutes the selection problem. Using the Law of Iterated Expectations, the implications for
identification of E[Yd(1)] can be seen by writing this quantity as
E[Yd ð1Þ ¼ E[Yd ð1ÞjZd ¼ 1P(Zd ¼ 1Þ þ E[Yd ð1ÞjZd ¼ 0P(Zd ¼ 0Þ

ð2Þ

Each observation in the sample reveals Yjd(Zjd), Zjd, and Xjd. (We will sometimes write
Yjd : Yjd(Zjd) for short.) Hence, the sampling process identifies the selection probability
P(Zd = 1), the censoring probability P(Zd = 0), and the mean of Yd(1) in states with the
death penalty, E[Yd(1) | Zd = 1]. For example, in 1977 we have E[Y1(1)|Z1 = 1] = 9.7,
P(Z1 = 1) = 0.70, P(Z1 = 0) = 0.30. However, the sampling process does not reveal the
mean of Yd(1) in states without the death penalty, E[Yd(1)|Zd = 0]. Thus, E[Yd(1)] is only
partially identified by the data alone.

Polar Approaches to Inference
How might we proceed? This section considers polar approaches. One pole makes
assumptions strong enough to point-identify ATEs. The other only assumes an upper bound
on the homicide rate, the result being wide bounds on ATEs.
Assumptions that Point-identify Average Treatment Effects
At one extreme, researchers may impose assumptions strong enough to point-identify
ATEs. This has been the norm in the literature, with researchers applying a variety of
assumptions. In this section we give assumptions under which the three simple estimates
mentioned in the Introduction identify the effect of death penalty statutes on the national
homicide rate.
Random Treatment Selection
A common assumption is that the realized treatments Zjd are statistically independent of
potential outcomes, as they would be in a classical randomized experiment. This implies
that E[Y1(1)] = E[Y1(1)|Zd = 1] and E[Y1(0)] = E[Y1(0)|Zd = 0]. The ATE in 1977 is
point-identified under this assumption because E[Y1(1)|Zd = 1] and E[Y1(0)|Zd = 0] are
the observed mean homicide rates in states that do and do not have the death penalty.

123

128

J Quant Criminol (2013) 29:123–141

Combining this assumption with the data implies that the death penalty increases the
mean homicide rate by 2.8 per 100,000 (i.e., 9.7–6.9) in 1977. Without additional
assumptions, the ATE in 1975 is not identified. The reason is that, with the federal moratorium in place, no states had the death penalty during that time period.
The random-selection assumption is credible in randomized experiments, but it is not
generally credible in observational studies where treatments (i.e., death penalty statutes)
are self-selected. A particular concern is that states may adopt death penalty statutes in part
based upon their beliefs about the deterrent effect of such statutes.
Time-Invariant Treatment Response
Let Xj = 1 if state j is in the treated group (i.e., Zj1 = 1) and Xj = 0 if it is in the untreated
group (Zj1 = 0). Suppose that, within the group of treated states, mean treatment response
is the same in 1975 and 1977. Thus, E[Y1()|X = 1] = E[Y0()|X = 1]. The data for 1975
and the fact that no state had a death penalty statute that year imply that
E[Y0 ð0ÞjX ¼ 1 ¼ E[Y0 ð0ÞjX ¼ 1; Z ¼ 0 ¼ E(Y0 jX ¼ 1; Z ¼ 0Þ:
The data for 1977 and the fact that only treated states had a death penalty statute that year
imply that
E[Y1 ð1ÞjX ¼ 1 ¼ E[Y1 ð1ÞjX ¼ 1; Z ¼ 1 ¼ E(Y1 jX ¼ 1; Z ¼ 1Þ:
Combining this with the assumption that mean treatment response does not vary over time
for the treated group implies that the time-invariant effect of treatment on the treated (ETT)
is
ETT  ATEX¼1 ¼ E[Y1 ð1ÞjX ¼ 1  E[Y0 ð0ÞjX ¼ 1 ¼ E(Y1 jX ¼ 1; Z ¼ 1Þ  E(Y0 jX
¼ 1; Z ¼ 0Þ:
The right-hand side is the estimate of deterrence given by before-and-after analysis of the
treated states. The empirical finding with the data in Table 1 is -0.6 (9.7–10.3).
Before-and-after analysis of the treated states only reveals the ATE within this group of
states. One cannot perform an analogous analysis for the untreated states because they did
not have a death penalty statute in either year. One can interpret the before-and-after
estimate as giving the effect of death penalty statutes on the national homicide rate if one
thinks it credible to assume that the ETT equals the effect of treatment on the untreated
(ETU). However, the data in Table 1 make this interpretation suspect. The data show that
the homicide rate in the untreated states fell from 8.0 in 1975 to 6.9 in 1977. Thus, mean
treatment response varied with time in the untreated states.
Linear Homogeneous Treatment Response
A third assumption that point-identifies the ATE begins by posing a model of linear
homogeneous treatment response. Let
Yjd ðtÞ ¼ aj þ b  d þ c  t þ djd :

ð3Þ

The parameter c measures the effect on the homicide rate of having the death penalty.
This effect is assumed to be homogeneous across states j and dates d. The date-specific
intercept bd shifts the response function additively by date. Observe that this intercept

123

J Quant Criminol (2013) 29:123–141

129

does not vary with the treatment t or across states j. Similarly, the state-specific intercept aj
allows the response function to differ additively by state. The unobserved random variable
djd varies across states and periods.
Evaluated at realized values of treatments and outcomes, the model yields
Yjd ¼ aj þ b  d þ c  Zjd þ djd :

ð4Þ

The conventional practice is to impose distributional assumptions that point-identify c.
Here is one assumption that achieves this objective.
As in section ‘‘Time-invariant treatment response’’, let Xj = 1 if state j is in the treated
group (i.e., Zj1 = 1) and Xj = 0 if it is in the untreated group (Zj1 = 0). Assume that, for
each date d, E(dd|X, Zd) = 0 and E(a|X, Zd) = E(a|X). Then
EðYd jX; Zd Þ ¼ EðajXÞ þ b  d þ c  Zd :
It follows that
c ¼ ½EðY1 jX ¼ 1; Z1 ¼ 1Þ  EðY0 jX ¼ 1; Z0 ¼ 0Þ
 ½EðY1 jX ¼ 0; Z1 ¼ 0Þ  EðY0 jX ¼ 0; Z0 ¼ 0Þ:

ð5Þ

Thus, the ATE is point identified. The right-hand side of (5) is the DID form. Given the
model and the data on homicide rates and executions summarized in Table 1, we find that
the death penalty statute increases the homicide rate in every state and date by 0.5.
The problem with this approach to identification is, again, credibility. The linear
homogeneous response model in Eq. 3 is generally difficult to justify, as policies are
typically thought to have heterogeneous effects (Manski 1990; Moffitt 2005). The distributional assumptions used above in conjunction with the linear model are also hard to
justify. Instead, researchers often apply instrumental-variable assumptions asserting that
potential outcomes are mean-independent of some observed covariate that is statistically
associated with the realized treatment. Finding instrumental variables (IVs) that satisfy this
condition, however, has proven to be difficult in studies of the death penalty (Donohue and
Wolfers 2005).
Partial Identification Assuming Bounded Outcomes
Imposing assumptions strong enough to yield a definitive finding is alluring, but strong
assumptions may be inaccurate, yielding flawed and conflicting conclusions. Rather than
attempt to point-identify the ATE, partial-identification analysis does not impose the strong
assumptions that have been used in the literature. Instead, we make weaker assumptions
that yield bounds on the deterrent effect of the death penalty. Given the conflicting findings
in the literature and the methodological challenges in addressing the selection problem,
deriving bounds under assumptions that may be credible seems an important step forward.
A natural starting point is to ask what the data alone reveal about the ATE. Recall that
E[Yd ð1Þ ¼ E[Yd ð1ÞjZd ¼ 1  P(Zd ¼ 1Þ þ E[Yd ð1ÞjZd ¼ 0  P(Zd ¼ 0Þ:
The selection problem arises because the data do not reveal the homicide rate if a death
penalty statute were in place for states where there was no such statute. However, we do
know that the homicide rate per 100,000 residents logically cannot be larger than 100,000.
Thus, Yd(1) [ [0, 100,000] and, hence, E[Yd(1) = 1| Zd = 0] [ [0, 100,000]. To put a more
reasonable upper bound on this counterfactual mean outcome, note that across all states

123

130

J Quant Criminol (2013) 29:123–141

and both years (1975 and 1977), the observed homicide rate always was in the range [0.8,
32.8]. Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that E[Yd(1)|Zd = 0] [ [0, 35].
Using this upper bound, it follows that
E[Yd ð1Þ 2 fE½Yd ð1ÞjZd ¼ 1  P(Zd ¼ 1Þ þ 0  P(Zd ¼ 0Þ;
E[Yd ð1ÞjZd ¼ 1  P(Zd ¼ 1Þ þ 35  P(Zd ¼ 0Þg

ð6Þ

Observe that the width of this bound increases with the censoring probability P(Zd = 0).
Thus, if a large fraction of states adopt death penalty statutes, the width of the bound on
E[Yd(1)] is relatively narrow. In that case, the data do not reveal much about the distribution of Yd(0), so the analogous bound on E[Yd(0)] is wide.
Consider, for example, drawing inferences on mean potential outcomes during the
moratorium, when no states had the death penalty. Hence, P(Z0 = 0) = 1. In this case, the
data alone provide no information on the mean outcome if all states were to adopt a death
penalty, but they point-identify the mean outcome if all states were to not have a death
penalty.
The sharp bound on the ATE can be found by taking the appropriate difference between
the lower (upper) bound on E[Yd(1)] and the upper (lower) bound on E[Yd(0)] (Manski
1990). Given the restriction that the counterfactual mean outcomes lie in the interval [0,
35], the width of the bound on the ATE necessarily equals 35. It follows that, in the
absence of additional assumptions, the data cannot reveal the sign of the effect of the death
penalty on the murder rate.
Table 2 displays the bounds on the ATE for 1975 and 1977. The data show that in 1977,
seventy percent of the population resided in states which legalized the death penalty. In this
year, the population weighted murder rate was 9.7 in states with the death penalty and 6.9
in states without it. Thus, P(Z1 = 1) = 0.70, E[Y1(1) | Z1 = 1] = 9.7, and E[Y1(0) |
Z1 = 0] = 6.9. Thus, evaluation of the bound in (6) shows that E[Y1(1)] must be in the
interval [6.8, 17.3] and E[Y1(0)] must be in the interval [2.1, 26.6]. These bounds on mean
potential murder rates imply that the ATE must be in the interval [-19.8, 15.2].
Importantly, these bounds are not a confidence interval—they do not express statistical
imprecision created by sampling variability. Rather, the bounds express the ambiguity
created by the selection problem. Assuming only that counterfactual mean potential murder
rates cannot exceed 35, the data reveal that the ATE lies in the interval [-19.8, 15.2].
Recall that the ATE under the random-selection assumption was 2.8, with before-and-after
analysis was -0.6, and the DID estimate was 0.5.
Table 2 also derives bounds for 1975, a year in which no states had the death penalty. In
this year, P(Z0 = 1) = 0, so the data are uninformative about what the mean homicide rate

would be if all states had a death penalty statute. However, the data point-identify
E[Y0(0)] = 9.6. Thus, for 1975, we find that the ATE must be in the interval [-9.6, 25.4].
While the bounds for 1975 are different than those for 1977, both have a width of 35 and
both include zero.

Middle-Ground Assumptions
The analysis of section ‘‘Partial identification assuming bounded outcomes’’ made no
assumptions that relate criminal behavior in 1975 and 1977. Nor did it make assumptions
that relate criminal behavior in states that did and did not enact a death penalty in 1977.
Deterrent effects were permitted to vary across years and states.
One may reasonably believe that there is some commonality in criminal behavior across
years and states. However, it is not credible to assume as much commonality as the linear
homogeneous model, which supposes that deterrent effects are the same in every year and
every state. This leads us to consider ‘‘middle-ground’’ assumptions that presume some
commonality across years or states, but not homogeneity. In particular, we apply new
analysis of partial identification with repeated cross-sections developed in Manski and
Pepper (2012).3
To begin, section ‘‘Date-invariant treatment effects’’ permits treatment effects to vary
across states but assumes that they do not vary across years. Section ‘‘Date-invariant
treatment effects and covariate-invariant date intercepts’’ adds an assumption that datespecific intercepts do not vary across specified groups of states. Section ‘‘Bounded
instrumental variables’’ assumes the existence of bounded IVs, which bound the variation
of ATEs across groups of states. An appendix explains the algorithms used to compute our
empirical findings.
Our intent is not to endorse any particular assumption. It is rather to demonstrate how
the conclusions drawn depends on the assumptions imposed, thus providing a menu of
possibilities to readers of research on deterrence.
Date-Invariant Treatment Effects
We begin by assuming that the deterrent effect of the death penalty is the same in 1975 and
1977, in the formal sense that ATE1 = ATE0. Then the date-invariant ATE must lie in the
intersection of the two date-specific intervals shown in Table 2, these being [-9.6, 25.4]
and [-19.8, 15.2]. The result is [-9.6, 15.2].
While there remains much ambiguity about the deterrent effect of the death penalty, the
assumption of date-invariant treatment effects has identifying power. It reduces the width
of the bound on the ATE from 35 to 25. This bound does not allow us to sign the ATE, but
it does rule out claims that the death penalty reduces the mean murder rate by more than
-9.6 per 100,000 or increases it by more than 15.2.
The analysis below builds on this basic finding. Section ‘‘Basic analysis’’ introduces
new notation and uses it to re-derive the basic finding. The payoff from introducing
the new notation is that it provides the basis for consideration of further assumptions.
Section ‘‘Bounding time-series variation in mean response levels’’ studies the additional

Other authors have studied inference using assumptions that relax the linear homogeneous model. See

levels. Section ‘‘Tighter bounds on counterfactual mean response levels’’ shows the further
identifying power of placing a tighter prior bound on counterfactual mean response levels
than the [0, 35] bound assumed heretofore.
Basic Analysis
As earlier, suppose that one observes cross-sections of all the states including the District
of Columbia in 1975 (d = 0) and 1977 (d = 1). Assume that mean treatment response at
date d has the form
E[Y1 ðt)] ¼ E[Y0 ðt)] þ b:

ð7Þ

Here b is a date-specific intercept that distinguishes mean response at dates 0 and 1.
Equation (7) permits mean treatment response levels to vary across dates, but it assumes
that the ATE is invariant across dates. Specifically, E[Y1(1)] - E[Y1(0)] = E[Y0(1)] E[Y0(0)].
To shorten the notation, let Et : E[Y0(t)]. Then (7) is equivalent to
E½Y0 ðtÞ ¼ Et

ð8aÞ

E[Y1 ðtÞ ¼ Et þ b:

ð8bÞ

Equations (8a)–(8b) have identifying power because they reduce the number of
unknown mean potential outcomes by one. Without the assumption, we do not know the
four quantities E[Yd(t)], d = 0, 1; t = 0, 1. With the assumption, we do not know the three
quantities (E0, E1, b).
To obtain the identifying power of the assumption, first consider each date-treatment
pair (d, t) separately and obtain the identification region for E[Yd(t)] using only the
assumption of bounded outcomes, as was done in section ‘‘Partial identification assuming
bounded outcomes’’. Let this interval be called [Ld(t), Ud(t)]. Combining this with (8a)–
(8b), the available information is
L0 ðtÞ  Et  U0 ðtÞ;
L1 ðtÞ  Et þ b  U1 ðtÞ;

t ¼ 0; 1;
t ¼ 0; 1:

ð9aÞ
ð9bÞ

Thus, the feasible values of the three unknowns (b, E0, E1) are all the triples that satisfy
the four inequalities given in (9a)–(9b).
Table 2 gives the values of [Ld(t), Ud(t)], d = 0, 1; t = 0,1. Inserting these values in
(9a)–(9b) yields these findings for (E0, E1, b): b [ [-7.5, 17.0], Eo = 9.6, and E1 [ [0,
24.8]. Hence, the date-invariant ATE lies in the interval [-9.6, 15.2], as shown earlier by a
more direct argument.
Bounding Time-Series Variation in Mean Response Levels
The analysis of section ‘‘Basic analysis’’ placed no a priori restrictions on time-series
variation in treatment response levels between 1975 and 1977. Some states could have
become much more prone to homicide over this period while others could have become
much less prone to homicide. We only assumed that the overall deterrent effect of the death
penalty remains stable over time.
Our objective was to learn about the ATE, but we also found that assumption (7) and the
data implied a bound on the variation in mean response levels between 1975 and 1977,

123

J Quant Criminol (2013) 29:123–141

133

namely b [ [-7.5, 17.0]. Thus, mean potential homicide rates may have decreased by as
much as 7.5 per 100,000 or increased by as much as 17.0 per 100,000 over the three-year
period.
One might not think it credible that such large variations in mean potential homicide
rates could have occurred over such a short time period. One might be willing to assume
that b must lie in some narrower interval than [-7.5, 17.0]. Such an assumption may imply
a narrower bound on the ATE.
Consider, for example, the assumption that b lies in the interval [-5.0, 3.0]. One
might motivate this assumption by the fact that the largest state-specific observed
decrease in the homicide rate between 1975 and 1977 was 5.0 and the largest observed
increase was 2.9. If one uses [-5.0, 3.0] as an a priori bound on b, application of (8a, 8b)
implies that the ATE lies in the interval [-5.8, 12.7], narrowing the bound [-9.6, 15.2]
derived earlier.
Alternatively, consider the much stronger assumption that b = 0. This assumption
permits individual states to experience time-series variation in their proneness to homicide,
but it supposes that there is no national trend. Combining this assumption with (8a, 8b)
implies that the ATE lies in the interval [-2.8, 7.7].
Readers of research on deterrence may vary in their beliefs on the credible range of
values for b. To enable readers to bring to bear their own beliefs and determine the
implications for inference on the ATE, the solid lines in Fig. 1 display the bound on the
ATE as a function of b. The figure shows how restrictions on b reduce ambiguity about
deterrence. A person who believes that b B -3 can conclude that the ATE is positive; that
is, the death penalty increases the expected homicide rate. In contrast, someone who
believes that b C 8 can conclude that the ATE is negative; that is, the death penalty deters
crime. Someone who thinks that b may lie in the interval (-3, 8) cannot identify the sign of
the ATE.

Tighter Bounds on Counterfactual Mean Response Levels
We have thus far placed only a very weak bound on the counterfactual homicide rates
E[Yd(t) |Zd = t], supposing that they must lie in the range [0, 35]. Of the 102 state-specific
homicide rates observed to occur in 1975 and 1977, the central ninety percent fall in the
interval [2, 15]. Suppose that one uses this interval as a bound on E[Yd(t) |Zd = t] rather
than the earlier bound [0, 35]. Then application of (8a, 8b) implies that b [ [-6.1, 3.0] and
ATE [ [-5.2, 5.4].
The dashed lines in Fig. 1 display how the bound on the ATE varies with b. Assuming
the tighter bound on mean counterfactual outcomes substantially narrows the bounds on
the ATE relative to those reported in section ‘‘Bounding time-series variation in mean
response levels’’. Whereas the assumption b = 0 earlier implied that ATE [ [-2.8, 7.7], it
now implies that ATE [ [-2.2, 1.7]. A person who believes that b \ -2 can now conclude
that the ATE is positive, while one who believes that b C 2 can conclude that the ATE is
negative.
Date-Invariant Treatment Effects and Covariate-Invariant Date Intercepts
In section ‘‘Date-invariant treatment effects’’, b was the mean difference in potential
murder rates between 1975 and 1977, the mean being computed across all states in the
nation. Let X be a covariate that separates states into K distinct groups, each group
containing at least one state. We now combine the assumption of date-invariant treatment
effects with the assumption that groups of states with different values of X have the same
date intercepts. A stronger version of the assumption was made in the linear homogeneous
model of section ‘‘Assumptions that point-identify average treatment effects’’, where it was
assumed that states with different (covariate, realized treatment) values share the same
mean date intercepts.
Let Et|X : E[Y0(t)|X]. Assume that
E½Y0 ðtÞjX ¼ EtjX ;

ð10aÞ

E½Y1 ðtÞjX ¼ EtjX þ b:

ð10bÞ

This repeats assumption (7), now conditional on X, and also assumes that b does not vary
with X.
Repeating the earlier derivation, but now conditional on X, let [Ld(t|x), Ud(t|x)] be the
bound on E[Yd(t)|X] obtained using only the assumption that outcomes are bounded in the
range [0, 35]. Combining this with (10a)–(10b), the available information is
L0 ðtjXÞ  EtjX  U0 ðtjXÞ;
L1 ðtjXÞ  EtjX þ b  U1 ðtjXÞ;

t ¼ 0; 1; all X
t ¼ 0; 1; all X:

ð11aÞ
ð11bÞ

Thus, the feasible values of the (2K ? 1) unknowns (b,E0|X, E1|X, all X) satisfy the 4K
inequalities given in (11a)–(11b).
Given that b does not vary with X or t, adding covariates provides additional identifying
information. When K = 1, as in section ‘‘Date-invariant treatment effects’’, there are three
unknowns that satisfy four inequalities. When K = 2, five unknowns satisfy eight
inequalities. When K = 4, nine unknowns satisfy sixteen inequalities. And so on.
To illustrate, we evaluate the ATE with two definitions of X. First, X indicates whether
a state does or does not have a death penalty statute in 1977; that is, whether it is treated or

123

J Quant Criminol (2013) 29:123–141

135

untreated. Second, we let X indicate the location of a state in one of four mutually
exclusive and exhaustive census regions. The derivation of findings in the latter case is not
particularly revealing, so we omit the details. However, the former case is simple and
yields an interesting analytical result. Hence, we give the derivation first before examining
the empirical findings.
Treatment Group as the Covariate
When the covariate differentiates treated and untreated states, the ETT is the DID estimate
and the ETU is partially identified. To see this, let Xj = 1 if Zj1 = 1 and Xj = 0 if Zj1 = 0.
The former are the treated states and the latter are the untreated ones. With this definition
of X, the eight inequalities (11a)–(11b) become
0  E1j0  35;
0  E1j1  35;

E0j0 ¼ EðY0 jX ¼ 0Þ;
0  E1j0 þ b  35;
E0j1 ¼ EðY0 jX ¼ 1Þ;

E0j0 þ b ¼ EðY1 jX ¼ 0Þ;
0  E0j1 þ b  35;

E1j1 þ b ¼ EðY1 jX ¼ 1Þ:

Given these bounds, the equalities in the first row point-identify the date intercept, with
b ¼ EðY1 jX ¼ 0Þ  EðY0 jX ¼ 0Þ:
In our application, b = -1.1. Recall that, using only assumption (7) rather than (10a, 10b),
we could only conclude that b [ [-7.5, 17.0].
With knowledge of b and the full set of inequalities, it is straightforward to assess
identification of the four mean response values. We find that
E1j0 2 ½maxð0; bÞ; minð35; 35  bÞ;

E0j0 ¼ EðY0 jX ¼ 0Þ; E0j1 ¼ EðY0 jX ¼ 1Þ;
E1j1 ¼ EðY1 jX ¼ 1Þ  b:

Thus, the ETT is point-identified, with
ETT  E1j1  E0j1 ¼ ½E(Y1 jX ¼ 1Þ  E(Y0 jX ¼ 1Þ  ½E(Y1 jX ¼ 0Þ  E(Y0 jX ¼ 0Þ
This is the DID form obtained earlier using the stronger assumptions of the linear
homogeneous model.4
The ETU is partially identified. The data and assumptions reveal that
ETU  E1j0  E0j0 2 ½maxð0; bÞ  E(Y0 jX ¼ 0Þ; minð35; 35  bÞ  E(Y0 jX ¼ 0Þ:
Empirical Findings
Table 3 displays the empirical findings for the ETT, ETU and ATE under many of the
assumptions considered thus far. Two conclusions warrant attention.
First, while incorporating covariates clearly tightens the estimated bounds on the ATE,
there remains much ambiguity. For example, when census region is used as a covariate, the
bound on the ATE shrinks from [-9.6, 15.2] to [-9.0, 10.1]. Thus, while the ATE bound
4

Manski and Pepper (2012) show that the DID form arises under a yet weaker assumption where the dateinvariance restriction only applies to the Y(0) response function. In this case, the ETT is point-identified at
date d = 1 but not at d = 0.

shrinks by nearly six points, we still cannot determine whether the death penalty increases
or decreases the national homicide rate.
Second, when the treatment group is used as a covariate, the ETT is point-identified and
estimated to equal 0.5, but the ATE is only partially identified and estimated to lie in the
interval [-1.9, 8.3]. Researchers often loosely report the DID estimate as ‘‘the’’ effect of
deterrence, without being careful to state their maintained assumptions. The ATE equals
the DID estimate if one assumes that the ETU equals the ETT, as is the case with the linear
homogenous response model. However, without this or another assumption that makes the
ETU equal the ETT, using treatment group as a covariate does not identify the sign of the
ATE.
Bounded Instrumental Variables
The model introduced in section ‘‘Date-invariant treatment effects and covariate-invariant
date intercepts’’ assumed common time-series variation in treatment response across
groups of states, but placed no restrictions on cross-sectional variation in treatment
response. Traditional IVs assume that specified groups of treatment units have the same
mean treatment response or the same ATEs. It often is difficult to motivate such sharp
assumptions, but it may be easier to motivate weaker assumptions asserting that mean
response or ATEs do not differ too much across groups. We refer to such assumptions as
asserting the existence of bounded instrumental variables.
To demonstrate the idea, we apply it here to group-specific ATEs. Formally, we consider identification of the ATE when the researcher selects a non-negative constant D and
assumes that
jATEx  ATEx0 j  D for all x and x0

ð12Þ

This assumption bridges the gap between the linear homogenous model, which assumes
that the ATE is identical across all states j and dates d, and the model in (7) which allows
the ATE to vary across states.
When D = 0, inequality (12) gives a traditional instrumental-variable assumption
asserting that groups of states with different covariates have the same ATE. For example,
the ATE might be assumed to be the same across the two treatment groups or the four
census regions considered in section ‘‘Date-invariant treatment effects and covariateinvariant date intercepts’’. The identifying power of this assumption was first analyzed in
Manski (1990), where the bound on the overall ATE was shown to be the intersection of
the bounds on the group-specific ATEs.

123

J Quant Criminol (2013) 29:123–141

137

Letting D [ 0 weakens the traditional assumption by supposing that the ATE may differ
across groups by no more than D. The larger the selected value of D, the weaker the
assumption. To assess the sensitivity of inference to choice of D, Fig. 2 maintains the
assumptions of sections ‘‘Date-invariant treatment effects’’ and ‘‘Date-invariant treatment
effects and covariate-invariant date intercepts’’, adds assumption (12), and displays the
bound on the ATE as a function of D.
Figure 2a takes the covariate to be the treatment group, treated or untreated. The traditional IV assumption (D = 0) point identifies the ATE, revealing that the death penalty
increases the mean murder rate by 0.5. This holds because the IV assumption implies that
ETT = ETU. However, ambiguity about the ATE increases with D. Any value of D larger
than one renders it impossible to sign the ATE. For example, the bounds on the ATE when

D = 2 and D = 5 are [-0.3, 0.9] and [-1.2, 1.8] respectively. Still, these bounds are
substantially more informative than the bound of [-1.9, 8.3] reported in Table 3.
Figure 2b takes the covariate to be the census region. Setting D = 0 assumes that all
four regions have the same ATE. This implies that the overall ATE lies within the interval
[-7.6, 1.8]. Setting D = 2 implies that the ATE lies in the interval [-8.6, 3.2]. Recall that
without this restriction linking the ATE across the four regions, we earlier found that the
deterrent effect of the death penalty lies in the interval [-9.0, 10.1].
The bound on the ATE using census region as a bounded IV can be further narrowed if
one brings to bear information on the date intercept b. Figure 3 displays the bound as a
function of b in the most restrictive case where the ATE is assumed to be the same across
all four regions; that is, D = 0. This assumption implies that b [ [-2.4, 7.0]. Prior
knowledge of the value of b within this range substantially narrows the bounds on the
ATE. In fact, the ATE is nearly point identified if a person knows the exact value of b. For
example, the ATE = 0.4 if b is known to equal -1.0, the value found when treatment
group is used as the covariate. And the ATE = -1.6 if b is known to equal 1.0. Moreover,
a person who believes that b is less (greater) than -0.5 can conclude that the ATE is
positive (negative). These strong conclusions, however, require sufficiently strong prior
information on D and b. Someone who thinks that b lies in an interval that includes -0.5 or
that the ATE across regions may differ (i.e., D [ 0) cannot necessarily identify the sign of
the ATE.

Conclusion
Readers of the 1978 report of the NRC Panel on Research on Deterrent and Incapacitative
Effects (Blumstein et al. 1978) will not be surprised by the persistent problems researchers
have had in providing credible inference on the deterrent effect of the death penalty. The
NRC report warned the research community of the fundamental shortcomings of the data
and methods, and questioned whether empirical research could provide useful information
at all.

123

J Quant Criminol (2013) 29:123–141

139

Despite these warnings, various researchers have continued to examine the same or
more recent data using the same or similar methods. To yield point identification, research
continues to combine data with untenable assumptions. Yet, as in 1978, the results have
been found to be highly sensitive to these assumptions and no consensus has emerged. As
we see it, the research has failed to provide meaningful answers.
Given that deterrence remains an important and controversial question, it seems useful
to consider alternative methodological paradigms. This paper has demonstrated some of
what can be learned about the deterrent effect of the death penalty under relatively weak
assumptions. In particular, we have studied the identifying power of assumptions
restricting variation in treatment response across places and time. The results are findings
of partial identification that bound the deterrent effect of capital punishment.
By successively adding stronger identifying assumptions, the analysis makes transparent how assumptions shape inferences. If one assumes only that outcomes are bounded,
one cannot identify the sign of the ATE and one can only draw weak conclusions about its
magnitude. Those who find it credible to make further assumptions can obtain more
informative findings.
Imposing certain assumptions implies that adoption of a death penalty statute increases
homicide, but other assumptions imply that the death penalty deters it. Thus, society at
large can draw strong conclusions only if there is a consensus favoring particular
assumptions. Without such a consensus, data on sanctions and murder rates cannot settle
the debate about deterrence. However, data combined with weak assumptions can bound
and focus the debate. See Manski and Nagin (1998) for similar analysis of the effect on
recidivism of alternative sentencing of juvenile offenders.
To demonstrate partial identification analysis in a simple setting, this paper used only
2 years of data (1975 and 1977) and compared two broad treatments (the presence or
absence of a death penalty statute). Future work can exploit richer data. Whereas the
traditional DID framework uses only two periods of data, the approach developed in
Manski and Pepper (2011) can exploit multiple periods.
Future work can also use more refined definitions of treatments. One might differentiate
treatments by the specifics of the death penalty statute enacted, the way it is implemented,
and by the nature of the non-capital sanctions that a state has in place. Using more detailed
treatment measures may enable one to study how the specifics of sanctions regimes
influence homicide.
We caution that examining more refined treatments can further complicate identification. All else equal, the selection problem intensifies as one refines the definition of
treatments. This occurs because the probability that a person receives a refined treatment is necessarily no larger than and typically is smaller than the probability of
receiving an aggregated treatment. Refinement of treatment definition may also raise
measurement issues. Whereas the presence or absence of a death penalty statute is
straightforward to measure, more refined features of sanctions regimes may be less
readily observed.
Finally, future work might address the problem of measuring statistical precision. We
noted in the Introduction that measurement of statistical precision requires specification of
a sampling process that generates the data. However, we are unsure what type of sampling
process is reasonable to assume when the data are a repeated cross-section of states.
Existing methods for statistical analysis in settings of partial identification assume that the
data are a random sample drawn from an infinite population, but this sampling assumption
does not seem natural when considering states as units of observation.

Appendix: Computation of Bounds on the ATE under Middle-Ground
Assumptions
We used linear programming simplex algorithms coded in Gauss V11 to compute the
feasible values of the unknown parameters in (11a)–(11b). For this application, these
algorithms are equivalent to a straightforward two step computational method. The first
step derives the feasible values of b as the intersection of 2K bounds, each obtained by
differencing the bounds on mean response at dates 0 and 1. The second step computes the
feasible values of E1|X as the intersection of the dates 0 and 1 bounds on E1|X, where the
date 1 bounds follow directly from (11b). E0|X is point identified using data from date 0.
To illustrate, consider the basic no-covariate date-invariant treatment effect model
in section ‘‘Date-invariant treatment effects’’. The feasible values of the three unknowns
(b, E0, E1) are the triples that satisfy the four inequalities given in (9a)–(9b). Equation (9a)
provides initial (non-sharp) bounds on E0 and E1. In particular, data from date 0 point
identify E0 and provide no information about E1.
Given this initial information on (E0, E1), the first step is to derive feasible values of b.
Differencing (9a) and (9b) yields two sets of bounds on b, one for each value of t:
L1 ðtÞ  U0 ðtÞ  b  U1 ðtÞ  L0 ðtÞ;

t ¼ 0; 1:

ð13Þ

Given that b does not vary across treatments, it must lie in the intersection of the bounds
for t = 0 and t = 1. Let {bL, bU} denote the lower and upper intersection bounds on b.
Given these bounds on b, the second step is to update the bounds on E1. Equation (9a,
9b) implies two distinct bounds. From (9a), we know that L0(1) B E1 B U0(1) and, from
(9b), we have L1(1) - bU B E1 B U1(1) - bL. Given that E1 does not vary across dates, it
must lie in the intersection of these two bounds.
Further iterations provide no additional information about the feasible values of the
parameters. Consider, for example, using the updated bounds on E1 to further refine the
bounds on b. Focusing on the potentially interesting case where the intersection bounds on
E1 are {L1(1) - bU, U1(1) - bL}, we see that
L1 ð1Þ  U1 ð1Þ þ bL  b  U1 ð1Þ  L1 ð1Þ þ bU :
This lower bound is smaller than bL and the upper bound is larger than bU. Hence, iteration
yields no improvement.
We use the same two-step approach to derive bounds on the 2K ? 1 unknown
parameters in date-invariant models with covariates. When evaluating the feasible values
under the bounded IV model, values of b which are inconsistent with inequality (12) are
classified as infeasible.
