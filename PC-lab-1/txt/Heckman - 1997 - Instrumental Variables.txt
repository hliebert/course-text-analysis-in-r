Instrumental Variables
A Study of Implicit Behavioral
Assumptions Used In Making
ProgramEvaluations
James Heckman

ABSTRACT
This paper considers the use of instrumental variables to estimate the
mean effect of treatment on the treated, the mean effect of treatment on
randomly selected persons and the local average treatment effect. It examines what economic questions these parameters address. When responses to treatment vary, the standard argument justifying the use of
instrumental variables fails unless person-specific responses to treatment
do not influence decisions to participate in the program being evaluated.
This requires that individual gains from the program that cannot be predicted from variables in outcome equations do not influence the decision
of the persons being studied to participate in the program. In the likely
case in which individuals possess and act on private information about
gains from the program that cannot be fully predicted by variables in
the outcome equation, instrumental variables methods do not estimate
economically interesting evaluation parameters. Instrumental variable
methods are extremely sensitive to assumptions about how people process information. These arguments are developed for both continuous
and discrete treatment variables and several explicit economic models
are presented.

You can run from economic models but you can't hide from them.

I. Introduction
The method of instrumentalvariablesis widely used to evaluate
programs and estimate various "treatment effects" including the impact of
schooling on earnings. It is routinelyinvoked when it is suspected that persons
sort into programsor schooling levels on the basis of unobserved factors that
affect outcomes but are not due to the programor treatmentbeing evaluated.
Ability may raise earningsand more able people may go to school but schooling
may not raise the earningsof any given person. To resolve this issue, an instrument Z is often sought that determinesparticipationin schooling but that does
not directly affect earningsand does not depend on ability. It is easy to check
whetherZ determinesparticipation.The relationshipof Z with unobservedability
is determinedby assumptionand speculation.
Thispaperclarifiesthe implicitbehavioralassumptionsthatunderlieapplication
of the methodof instrumentalvariables.Conventionalapplicationsof the method
assume that the "treatment"being evaluated has the same effect for everyone
amongpersons with a given value of the regressorsX. In the simplest case, the
assumptionis that the effect is the same for all persons. In these cases, the effect
of treatmenton the treated(Heckmanand Robb 1985),the local averagetreatment
effect (Imbensand Angrist 1994)and the effect of treatmenton persons selected
at randomfromthe populationat largeare all the same for persons with the same
X characteristics.In the more general case when responses to treatmentvary
amongpersons with the same X, these three parametersare different, and the
method of instrumentalvariables breaks down unless special assumptions are
madeaboutwhat informationthe persons or institutionsthat determineparticipation act on.
This paper presents the identifyingassumptionsthatjustify applicationof the
methodof instrumentalvariablesto estimate each of the three conceptuallydistinct parametersthat are frequently confused in the empiricalliterature. The
parametersare definedfor both discrete and continuoustreatmentswhere appropriate. Simpleeconomic models illustratethe implicitassumptionsthat are made
in applicationsof the method of instrumentalvariables. A basic result in this
paperis that if responses to treatmentvary, and if we are interestedin estimating
the meaneffect of treatmenton the treated,or the effect of treatmenton randomly
selected persons, instrumentalvariables identify these parametersonly when
agentsdo not select into the programon the basis of the idiosyncraticcomponent
of their response to the program.This is a strong assumptionthat forces the
analystto assume either irrationalityor ignoranceon the part of persons whose
behavioris being studied.
I also considerwhat economic questionsthese econometricparametersanswer.
In this regardthe local average treatmenteffect is potentiallyproblematic.The
"causal effect" for this parameteris definedby the operationof an instrumental
variableexternalto the outcome equation,and not in terms of parametersof the
outcome equation. This is an unusual way to define an economic parameter.
Nonetheless, I show that for certain instrumentsand certaineconomic environments the local averagetreatmenteffect answers a well-posed economic evaluation question.

Heckman 443
I first define the three parametersin the standardmodel of the evaluation
problem,whichis just the switchingregressionframeworkof Quandt(1972, 1988).
I start with the more familiarcase when treatmentsare discrete. I consider the
case of a continuoustreatmentvariablein a later section.

II. The EvaluationProblem
A person may occupy two potential states, only one of which is
realized for any person. Let Y1be the outcome in the treated state. YOis the
outcome in the untreatedstate. At any time a person is either in the treated or
untreatedstate but cannot be in both states at the same time. Participationin a
programis synonymouswith being in the treated state. The gain from going into
the programis A = (Y1 - Y0).
We cannot form this gain for anyone because one or the other component of
the difference is missing. The statistical approachto this problem replaces the
missingdata on persons using group means or some other group statistics.
Many parametersfor evaluatingsocial programshave been proposed. Sometimes, it is of interest to explore the impacts of programson distributionsof
outcomesand to determineif it raises the welfareof participantsor that of a third
party "social planner." This is done in other papers. (See Heckman and Smith
1993;Heckmanand Smith 1995;Heckman, Smith and Clements 1997;Heckman
and Smith 1997.) Much attention is devoted to the parameter"the mean effect
of treatmenton the treated." This parameteranswers the following question.
How does the programchange the outcome of participantscompared to what
they would have experienced if they had not participated?Signify participation
by a variableD. For persons who participate,let D = 1. For those who do not,
let D = 0.
The mean change in the outcome attributableto participationin the program
for persons with characteristicsX is
(1) E(

D = 1, X) = E(Y, - YoID = 1,X).

We know or can reliably estimate E(Y1ID = 1, X). This is what participants
experience.We don't know E(YIoD = 1, X), what participantswould have experienced had they not participated.
A second counterfactualthat manyconfuse with the mean effect of "treatment
on the treated" is the effect of "randomlyassigninga person in the population
to the program."That counterfactualis
(2) E(AIX) = E(Y1 - Yo1X).
Neither componentof this mean has a sample analogueunless there is universal
participationor nonparticipationin the program, or participationis randomly
determinedand there is full compliancewith the randomizationregime.
The intuitivelyappealingcounterfactual(2) is very difficultto estimate. Picking
a millionaireat randomto participatein a trainingprogramfor low skilled workers, or makingan idiot into a PhD may be intriguingthoughtexperimentsbut are
usuallyneitherpolicy relevantnor feasible. They are not policy relevantbecause

interestcenterson the effects of programson intendedrecipients-not on persons
for whomthe programwas never intended.It is not a feasible random-assignment
strategybecause millionaireswould never agree to participatein such a training
programeven if they were offered the chance to do so, and few idiots would be
able to attainthe PhD in most fields.1
A third counterfactualis the effect of treatmenton persons at the marginof
beingtreated.This is a local version of treatmenton the treatedand requiresthat
the relevantmarginbe specified. It is formallydefinedin Section V.
Understandingthe differences among these counterfactualsis of central importancein understandingcompeting approachesused in the evaluation literature. Previous practice in the econometricevaluationcommunity(for example,
Ashenfelter1978, LaLonde 1986, Ashenfelterand Card 1985)assumes a special
model in which all three counterfactualsare the same.

III. ConstructingCounterfactuals
Whilethe linearregressionmodel is commonlyused, it is actually
simplerand at the same time more generalto take a nonparametricapproachand
conditionon regressorsX. Define
E(Y1IX) =

IM(X)

E(Yo[X) = go(X).

Thus we may write
3(a) Yo= >(X) + Uo
3(b) Yi = 1(X) + U1
where E(U0oX) = 0 and E(U IX) = 0. In the familiarregressionsetting, R0(X)
=Xp and RI1(X)= XP31,but our results apply more generally.
Observedoutcome Y can be writtenas
Y= DY1 + (1 - D)Yo
so Y is either Y1or Y0.If we insert (3a) and (3b) into this expression, we obtain
(4) Y = i0(X) + D(il1(X) - Io(X) + U, - Uo) + U0.
This is a "two regime"or "switchingregression"model(see Quandt1972, 1988).
Labor economists sometimes call it a Roy model (see, for example, Heckman
and Sedlacek 1985or Heckmanand Honore 1990).
The term multiplyingD is the gain from the program.The gain has two compois the gain for the average person with characteristicsX
nents: .IJ(X)- ox0(X)
in the population,and U1 - U0 is the idiosyncraticgain for a particularperson.
Note thatthese unobservablesmay be observedby the personor personsdeciding
1. Becauseof agentself-selection,randomassignmentof eligibilityonly identifiesthe effect of treatment
on the treatedunless furtherassumptions,beyondthe validityof randomassignment,are assumed.See
Heckman(1996).

participationin the program.They are unobservedby the social scientist trying
to estimatethe impact of the program.
In this notation, the averagegain for persons with characteristicsX is
E(AX) = ixl(X) - o(X).
Thisis the effect of placingan averagepersonwith characteristicsX in the population at large into the program.
The effect of treatmenton the treatedfor persons with characteristicsX is
E(AIX,D = 1) = i(X)

--

o(X) + E(U1 - UolX,D = 1).

This expression differs from the previous one by the additionalterm E(U1 UolX, D = 1). E(AIX) = E(A|X, D = 1) when E(U1 - UolX, D = 1) = 0.
This can happenif U1 - UO= 0 or if agents either do not know U1 - UOor do
not act on it. The term added to the difference in populationmeans (xil(X) po(X))is the gain of participantsover the averagegain that would be experienced
by the entire populationwith characteristicsX. I define the local average treatment effect in Section V.
We may rewrite Equation4 in terms of these two parameters:
(5)

Y = Ro(X) + D[E(AIX)] + {Uo + D(U1 - Uo)}

and
+ E(AIX,D = 1) + {UO+ D[U1 - Uo- E(U- UoIX,D = 1)]}.
(6) Y= 0O(X)
From Equation5, in a regressionof Y on D, the coefficienton D is
E(YIX, D = 1) - E(YIX, D = 0)
= E(AIX) + E(U, UoIX, D = 1) + [E(UoIX,D = 1) - E(UoIX,D = 0)]
= E(AIX,D = 1) + E(UoIX,D = 1) - E(UoIX,D = 0].

The coefficient differs from E(AIX) by the amount
E(U1 - UoIX,D = 1) + E(UolX,D = 1) - E(Uo\X,D

= 0).

It differsfrom E(AIX, D = 1) by
E(UolX,D = 1) - E(UoIX,D = 0).
This term is the mean selection bias. This bias tells us how the outcome in the
base state differsbetween programparticipantsand nonparticipants.Absent any
generalequilibriumeffects of the programon nonparticipants,such differences
cannotbe attributedto the program.
The parametersE(AIX, D = 1) and E(AIX) coincide when the mean change
in the unobservableconditionalon D is zero, namely, E(U1 - UoIX, D = 1) =
0. We now examinein detailthe two special cases when this conditionis satisfied
and E(AIX) = E(AIX, D = 1).
In the first case, there are no unobservable components of the gain. This
model-called the "dummy endogenous variable model" (see Heckman
1978)-is widely used in applied work (see Ashenfelter 1978; Ashenfelter and
Card1985;LaLonde 1986).It assumesthatconditionalon X, the effect of program

participationis the same for everyone. This is sometimes called the common
coefficientmodel.
The second case where U1 # U0 is more subtle. In this case U1 - U0 or
informationcorrelatedwith or dependenton it does not determinewho goes into
the program.Suppose, for example, that at the time people go into the program
they do not know Ul - U0. Their best forecast of U1 - Uo may be zero. Then
if their expectationof U1 - U0 is typical of that of the entire population,E(U1
- U IX, D = 1) = 0, and E(A|X) = E(AIX, D = 1). This case is analogousto
the "randomcoefficients" model of traditionaleconometrics.2Ex ante, persons
with the same X have identical expectations of gain. Ex post, people respond
differentlyto training.Observethat in eithercase, the problemof estimatingE(A
IX) or E(A|X, D = 1) using the difference in outcomes between participants
and nonparticipants,is the standardeconometricendogeneityproblemthat D is
stochasticallydependenton U0.
Irrespective of whether E(Ui - Uo X, D = 1) = 0 in Equation 6, the compo-

nent of the errorterm interactedwith D has mean zero. That is, E(D(U1 - Uo)
- E(U1 - Uo0X, D = 1)IX, D) = 0, because when D = 1,
X, 1)D= 1)
E(U1 - Uo - E(U1 - UolX,D
= E(U1 - UoX, D = 1)- E(U1 - UoX, D = 1) = 0.

Therefore D is uncorrelated with D(U1 - Uo - E(U1 - U0oX, D = 1)). Even

if E(AIX) # E(AIX, D = 1), for estimatingE(A|X, D = 1) the problemis the
standardone of correlationbetween D and U0. However for estimatingE(AIX),
an additionalsource of bias arises from the dependencebetween D and U1 - U0
(Heckmanand Robb 1985).

IV. The Method Of Instrumental Variables
A standardmethod for estimatingparametersin econometrics is
the method of instrumentalvariables. Instrumentalvariables must satisfy two
basic conditions.They mustbe mean-independentof the errortermsof Equations
5 and 6 that is,
(C- 1 -a) E[Uo + D(U1 - U0)IX, Z] = 0 (an identifyingconditionfor E(AIX))
or
(C-1-b)E[U0

+ D(Ul - Uo - E((Ui - Uo)ID = 1,X))IX,Z]

= 0

(an identifyingconditionfor E(A X, D = 1)).
These statisticalassumptionsare not innocuousand it will be demonstratedthat
they rest on implicitbehavioralassumptionsthat are much strongerthan what is

2. In the case consideredin this paper,however,regressorD is correlatedwith U0.A testablerestriction
of this model when U0 is mean independentof D and X, discussed in Heckmanand Robb (1985)and
Heckman,Smith, and Clements (1997) is that Var(YltD = 1, X) > Var(YolD = 0, X). Heckman,
Smith,andClements(1997)test andaccept this restrictionfor a job trainingprogram.They also discuss
modificationof this test for the case whereE(U0oD,X) 5 0.

requiredwhen the response to treatmentis homogeneous among persons with
the same value of X.
A second requiredcondition is that D depends on Z:
(C-2) E(DIX, Z) = Pr(D = IIX, Z)
where the probabilityis a nontrivialfunction of Z given X. This requires that
there be independentvariationin Z conditioningon X. In particular,it is required
that for each X, there be two values of Z, z $ z', which producedifferentvalues
for the probability.This assumptioncan be checked by estimatingthe probability
to see if it depends on Z. Assumptions(C- 1- a) and (C- - b) are not testable
when there is only one instrumentalvariable.
As a consequence of these conditions,the dependenceof Yon Z operatesonly
throughD. This excludes dependence of the parametersof interest on Z. Thus
for E(AIX), (C- - a) and (C-2) imply
E(YIX, Z) = CIo(X)+ E(AIX) Pr(D = 1 X, Z).

For E(AIX, D = 1), (C- 1- b) and (C-2) imply
E(YIX, Z) = [.o(X) + E(A^X,D = 1)Pr(D =

|X, Z).

Instrumentsare variablesthat "don't belongin the populationoutcome equation"
but that "belong" in the equationpredictingprogramparticipation.
The populationinstrumentalvariableequationfor E(AIX) is, under(C- 1-a)
and (C- 2),
E(YIX, Z = z) - E(YIX, Z = z')

(7) E(A[X)= Pr(D =
IX,Z = z) - Pr(D = lX, Z = z')
= 1|X,Z = z) - Pr(D = IIX,Z = z')]
[Pr(D = 1|X, Z = z) - Pr(D = 1IX,Z = z')]

E_(AIX)[(Pr(D

where z = z' and the denominatoris not zero. Replacingpopulationmeans with
sample means produces the instrumentalvariable estimator which, under standard conditions, converges to E(lAX). The parameterE(A X) is not a function
of Z, so the righthand side is not either.
The populationinstrumentalvariable equation for E(AIX, D = 1) is, under
(C- 1- b) and (C- 2),
(8) E(A[X,D = 1)=

E(YIX, Z = z) - E(YIX, Z = z')
Pr(D = 1IX, Z = z)- Pr(D = I X,Z = z')'

Again, the right hand side ratio does not depend on Z because of assumption
(C- 1- b).3'4

In a model where U1 - U0 is not zero and is not a determinantof D, in other
words, where (U1 - U0)is statisticallyindependentof X, Z, D, and hence
Pr(D = 1 X,Z, U1 - Uo) = Pr(D = 1 IX,Z, Y1 - YO)= Pr(D = 1IX,Z),

we can also ignore the componentD(U1 - Uo) in (4) in forminginstrumental
variableequationsbecause
E(D(Ul - Uo)IX,Z) = E((U1 - Uo) X, Z,D = 1)Pr(D = 1|X,Z) = 0

because E(U1 - UolX, Z, D = 1) = 0. All we really requireis mean independence: E(U1 - UolX, Z, D = 1) = E(U1 - Uo) = 0. Thus in the two cases
where E(AIX) = E(AIX, D = 1), where U1 - U0 - 0 or U1 - U0 cannot be

forecast by Z or D, we can use conventional textbook instrumentalvariable
methodsto identifythe parameterE(AlX) = E(AIX, D = 1).5
Whataboutmoregeneralcases? ConsiderEquation6 with associatedtreatment
parameterE(A IX, D = 1). Because the only source of dependencebetween the
error term and D is through U0 and not D(U1 - Uo - E(U1 - UoIX, D = 1)),

the instrumentalvariablemethodlooks promising.If assumptions(C- 1- b) and
(C-2) are satisfied, the IV moment conditions can be used to identify this parameter.
In generalsuch instrumentalvariablesare difficultto find. If the unobservable
Ul - Uo determines participation so Pr(D = 1 IX, Z, U1 - Uo) # Pr(D = 1 IX,

Z) then by Bayes' rule E(U1 - UoIX, Z, D = 1) $ 0, so from Equation5,
E(AX, Z, D = 1) = E(AIX) + E(Ut - UIX, Z, D = 1)

functionallydependson Z.6 If individualsselect into the programon the basis of
the unobservablesin the outcome equationor on the basis of the variablesthat
are (stochastically)dependenton the gain in unobservables,condition (C-1b) will not be satisfied. (See Heckman and Robb 1985, 1986.)Z determinesthe

5. These methodsare also justifiedin a thirdcase where U, - U, cannotbe perfectlyforecastby Z
but can be forecastby X.
6. FromBayes' rule,
Pr(D = IX, Z, U, - Uo)f(U, - UoIX,Z)f(X,Z) =f(Ul - UoIX,Z,D = 1)Pr(D = I|X,Z)f(X,Z)
wheref(Ui - UolX, Z) is the conditionaldensityof (Ul - Uo)given X, Z, f(Ul - UolX, Z, D = 1)
is the conditionaldensityof U, - Uogiven X, Z, D = 1 andf(X, Z) is thejoint densityof (X, Z). Then
for all values of (X, Z) so that Pr(D = 1IX, Z) $ 0, andf(X, Z) > 0,
Pr(D = 1 X, Z, Ut - Uo)f(U, - Uo IX, Z)

so the conditionalmeanof U1 - Uo, E(Ul - UolX, Z, D = 1) which is computedwith respectto this
density,is in generala functionof Z. Observethatthis dependenceexists even if U, - U0is independent
of X, Z sof(Ut - UoX, Z) = f(U, - Uo). If U, - Uo is independentof X, Z and U, - Uodoes not

is not satisfied, neitherwill condition (C- 1-a) be satisfied, so E(AIX) will not

Any valid applicationof the method of instrumentalvariables for estimating
these treatmenteffects in the case where the response to treatmentvaries among
personsrequiresa behavioralassumptionabouthow persons maketheirdecisions
aboutprogramparticipation.The issue cannot be settled by a statisticalanalysis.
Consideran example that is often cited as a triumphfor the applicationof the
method instrumentalvariables. Draft lottery numbersare sometimes alleged to
be ideal instrumentalvariables for identifyingthe effect of military service on
earnings(Angrist1990).The 1969U.S. lottery randomlyassigneddifferentpriority numbersto persons with differentbirth dates. The higherthe numberin the
draft,the less likely was a person to be drafted.Persons with high numberswere
virtuallycertain to be able to escape the draft. Letting 1 denote militaryservice
and 0 civilian service, if persons partly anticipate gain in U, - UO, or base
their decisions to go into the militaryon variablescorrelatedwith unobservable
components U1 - U0, persons with high Z for whom D = 1 (they serve in the
military)are likely to have high values of U, - Uo. This violates assumption

(C- 1- b) because E(U1 - UoID = 1, X, Z) will depend on Z, and makes the
birth date number an invalid instrumentfor identifyingE(A|X, D = 1). It is
plausiblethat the persons who are deciding to go into the militaryknow more
abouttheir gains from militaryservice than analysts using standarddata sets. If
this informationis at all useful in predictingtheirgainfromgoing into the military,
the draftnumberis not a valid instrument.Persons who have high Z who go into
the militaryare more likely to have high U1 - U0. That is, they at least partly
anticipate substantialgains to entering the military. Observe that if (C-l-b)
fails, (C- -a) must fail as well because then E(D(U1 - Uo)IX, Z) = E(U1 UolD = 1, X, Z) Pr(D = IX, Z) f 0 and hence the instrumentalso fails to
identifyE(A X).8'9
As a second example, it is sometimes suggested that cross-state variationin
welfarebenefitscan be used as instrumentalvariablesfor estimatingthe effect of
"treatmenton the treated" for participantsin trainingprograms.Suppose that
Y0refers to the earnings of untrainedlow-skill persons. Y1is their earningsif
trained.Parametersof welfare benefitfunctions,Z, do not plausiblyenter po0(X)
or [Li(X). But they could enter E(U1 - UoIX, Z, D = 1). If more generous
welfare schemes discourageparticipationin the trainingprogrambecause they
induce people to stay out of the market, then higher values of U1 - Uo would
tend to be found among programparticipantsin high benefit states if program
8. For anotherreason, the draftlottery numberis a poor instrumentfor identifyingE(AIX) or E(A X,
D = 1). Switchingfrom a regimeof a capriciousdraftto a lottery reducesuncertaintyand is likely to
changethe investmentbehaviorof personsat all levels of Z. In this instance,the switchfroma draftto
a lottery affects both E(AIX, D = 1) and E(AIX) because it fundamentallyalters schoolingandjob
traininginvestmentdecisions and their payoffs. Thus, knowinghow militaryservice affects earnings
duringthe period of a lottery would not be informativeabout how militaryservice affected earnings
duringthe period of an ordinarydraft. There is yet anotherreason why the draft lottery is a poor
instrument.Z is likely to be an X. Personswith highZ (a low chance of being drafted)are likely to be
moreattractiveto employersinvestingin their workers.A personunlikelyto be draftedis likely to be
a betterinvestmentbecause he is less likely to be removedfrom the firmto performmilitaryservice.
This causes (C - 1- b) to be violatedbecauseZ is reallyan X.
9. It mightbe thoughtthat because
E[U1 - Uo - E(U1 - UoIX,D = 1)IX,D = 1] = 0,

it follows that E[Ui - Uo - E(Ui - UoIX,D = 1)IX,Z, D = 1] = 0. This is not true. In general
E(UI - UoIX,Z, D = 1) E(UI - UoIX,D = 1).
Conditioningmore finely on X and Z does not producethe same result as conditioningon X. Then
even if
E(UoIX, Z) = 0,

it does not follow that (C- 1-b) is satisfied.In this case, Z is not a valid instrumentfor identifying
E(AIX, D = 1). For similarreasons, (C- 1-a) is unlikelyto be satisfiedeven if
E(Uo0X,Z) = 0

because
E[D(U1 - UoIX,Z)] = E[U, - UoIX,Z,D = l]Pr(D = I\X,Z)
does not equalzero. In this case Z is not a valid instrumentfor identifyingE(AIX) either.

A thirdexample is the problemof evaluatingthe impact of unionismon wage
rates. Robinson (1989) uses a test developed by Heckman and Robb (1985, p.
196) and determinesthat in his sample decisions to join unions are not made
on the basis of unobservablewage gains. Factors other than the unobservables
predictingwage gains determineunion membership.His evidence does not rule
out the possibilitythat unionmembershipis made on the basis of Rl(X) - oP(X).
It does ruleout the possibilitythatthe unobservablesin wage equationsdetermine
union membership.For this problemthe method of instrumentalvariables correctlyidentifiesthe effect of unionismon wages amongthose who choose to enter
unions.

V. The "Local Average Treatment Effect"
Imbens and Angrist (1994) introduce a new parameterinto the
evaluationliterature:the effect of treatmenton those who change state in response to a change in Z. More precisely, their parameteris E(YI - YoID(z)=
1, D(z') = 0) where D(z) is the conditionalrandomvariableD given Z = z, and
wherez' is distinctfromz, so z $ z'. This parameteris termedLATEfor the Local
Average TreatmentEffect. The parameterhas several nonstandardfeatures. It
is definedby variationin an instrumentalvariablethat is externalto the outcome
equation.Unlike the instrumentalvariables discussed in the preceding section,
in LATE,differentinstrumentsdefinedifferentparameters.Whenthe instruments
are indicatorvariablesthat denote differentpolicy regimes, LATEhas a natural
interpretationas the response to policy changes for those who change participation status in response to the change. When the instrumentsrefer to personalor
neighborhoodcharacteristicsused to predictan endogenousvariable,say schooling in an earningsequation, LATE often has a less clear cut interpretation.If
distance to the nearest school is the instrument,LATE estimates the effect of
variationin distance on the earningsgain of persons who are induced to change
their schooling status as a consequence of commutingcosts that vary within a
specifiedrange. If a personalcharacteristicis used as an instrument(for example,
family income), the parameterdefines the marginalchange in the outcome with
respect to the sample variationin family income among those who would have
changedtheir state in response to the sample variationin family income.
There is another nonstandardfeature of LATE. For any given instrument,
LATEis definedon an unidentifiedhypotheticalpopulation:persons who would
certainlychange from 0 to 1 if Z is changed. For different values of Z and for
differentinstruments,the LATE "parameter"changes and the populationfor
which it is definedchanges.
To define the LATE parametermore precisely, let D(z) be the conditional
randomvariableD given Z = z. (Conditioningon X is kept implicit in this section). Because D(z) is definedconditionalon a particularrealizationof Z = z, it

is independentof Z.10Imbens and Angrist(1994)assume
IA-1 (YO,Y1,D(z)) are independentof Z and Pr(D = 11Z = z) is a nontrivial
functionof Z. (These randomvariablesare understoodto be definedconditional
on X).
As a consequence of this assumption,for a given person (with fixed Yl, YO),
recalling that for Z = z, Y = Yo(l - D(z)) + Y1D(z), so
(9) E(YIZ = z) - E(YIZ = z')
= E[D(z)YI + (1 - D(z))YoIZ = z] - E[D(z')Y1 + (1 - D(z'))YoIZ = z']
= E((D(z) - D(z'))(Y1 - Yo)).

The finalstep follows from assumptionIA-1 and depends cruciallyon the conditional independenceof Y1, YOand D(z) from Z.
In the Imbens-Angristthought experiment,all of the randomvariablesin the
expressionare definedfor the same person. Thus for differentvalues of Z = z,
Y1and YOdo not change and {D(Z)}zEsupportofzis a collection of not necessarily
independentrandomvariablesproducedby changingz and not by changingany
otherrandomvariableor by changingthem in a way specifiedin assumptionIA-2,
below. In terms of the index model of discretechoice theory where index IN can
be written in terms of the index function g(Z, V), which may be a net profit or
net utility function IN = g(z, V)

(10) D= l(g(z,V) 0)
and V is a randomvariable. V stays fixed in the Imbens-Angristthoughtexperiment while z is varied.
From Equation9 it follows that
(11) E(YIZ = z) -E(YZ = z')
= E(Y1 - YoID(z) - D(z') = l)Pr(D(z) - D(z') = 1)
+ E(Y, - YoID(z) - D(z') = - 1)Pr(D(z) - D(z') = - 1).
Imbens and Angrist call E(Y1 - YoID(z) - D(z') = 1) and E(Y1 - YoID(z)
- D(z') = - 1) "causal" parameters. In general, these parameters depend on

the particularchoice of the z and z' as well as X. Factors externalto the outcome
equationdefine the LATE parameterand a differentparameteris producedfor
each choice of z and z'. If there are multiple instruments,there are multiple
parameters.Additionalinstrumentsdo not improve efficiency as they would in
the models consideredin previous sections of this paperand in standard"policy
invariant"structuralmodels. They instead define differentparameters.
Imbens and Angrist are not interested in parameter(11) althoughit answers
the question of how changes in Z change overall outcomes. To identify one of
their "causal" parameters,they invoke a second assumptionabout their hypotheticalrandomvariables:
10. For two randomvariables(J, K) let fbe the density (or frequency).Thenf(J, K) = f(JIK)f(K)
so J given K is statisticallyindependentof K althoughf(JIK) may be functionallydependenton K.

IA-2 For all z, z' in the support of z, either D(z) > D(z') for all persons or D(z)
D(z') for all persons.
The variation across z and z' is made holding the error term constant. This
condition makes either Pr(D(z) - D(z') = 1) or Pr(D(z) - D(z') = - 1) zero for
everyone. Thus, the effect of a change in Z is to shift people in one sector or the
other but not both. Suppose D(z) > D(z'), then Pr(D(z) - D(z') = -1) = 0 and
using (11) we obtain

Because this parameter is defined in terms of population moments, it can be
consistently estimated by instrumental variables methods replacing population
moments by sample moments.
Comparing (12) with (7) or (8) reveals that LATE looks like what the standard
IV converges to except for one important difference. The LATE parameter is
now z dependent. Both LATE and the parameters (7) or (8) are identified by
taking the ratio of the change in the outcome induced by Z and dividing by the
change in the probability of being in sector 1 induced by Z = z. Parameters (7)
or (8) do not depend on Z while the LATE parameter does.
and (C-2) are satisfied, LATE
Observe further that if conditions (C-1-a)
identifies E(AIX). If (C- -b) and (C-2) are satisfied the population moment
condition used to define LATE identifies E(A X, D = 1).
Condition IA-2 is satisfied if (10) characterizes choices. It is also satisfied if
IN = g(z, Vz) and D(z) = 1(IN > 01Z = z)
characterizes participation in the program being evaluated provided that g is
increasing in z, Vz is increasing in z and g is increasing in Vz. This would be
satisfied in the case of a scalar z if z > z', and o(z) is a random variable if

Vz= VZ,+ a(z)
where cr(z) > 0, for z > z'. If, however, o(z) is permitted to be both positive and
negative, condition IA-2 would not be satisfied.1'
11. The Roy model estimatedby Heckmanand Sedlacek (1985) has a decision rule of the form of
Equation10
IN = Y,- Yo+ k(z),
and if k(z) is monotonicin z producesa model consistentwith IA-2. Assume that Z is independentof
(Yi - Y0)so that the conditionsof IA-1 are satisfied. Y, - YO= V is fixed and differentrealizationsof
Z are consideredin the Imbens-Angristthoughtexperimentthat definestheir parameter.
In this set up, the event D(z) - D(z') = 1 is describedby the inequalities
Y, - Yo+ k(z)> Oand Y - Yo+ k(z')<O
(assumethat Y1- YOare continuousrandomvariables)so
-k(z') > Y - Yo> - k(z)
and the modelinducesa partitionof Y, - Y0. Now the LATE"causalparameter"is
E(Y - YoD(z) - D(z') = 1) = E(Y, - Yol-k(z)< Y, - Yo< -k(z'))

454 The Journalof HumanResources
Whenparametersare definedto be instrumentdependent,and they are defined
for unobservedsubsets of the population(those who would have changed state
if theirZ were changedwhile theirunobservableswere held fixed), it is no longer
clear what interestingpolicy question they answer. However, it is clear what
econometricproblem this redefinitionof the parameterof interest avoids. As
noted by Heckman (1990), it is necessary to have subsets of the supportof Z
where there is no selection bias to identify E(A X, D = 1). By redefiningthe
parameterof interest, Imbens and Angristavoid this problem,but at the cost of
definingan instrument-dependentparameterthat will vary across samples and
across instrumentseven within a sample. We now turn to the question of what
economic question is addressedby LATE and the other econometricevaluation
parameters.

VI. What Economic Policy Questions Do The
Parameters Answer?
If assumptionsIA-1 and IA-2 are ignored, a parametersimilarto
LATEanswers an interestingpolicy question. Considera programwith a voluntarycomponent.Choice of sector 1 is tantamountto participationin the voluntary
componentof the program.Choice of sector 0 is tantamountto nonparticipation.
These terms are used generallyand include failureto comply with a mandatory
program,that is, voluntarynonparticipation.If Z = z is the level of a policy,
and it is changed, then if Y is income, and Z affects both participationchoices
and averageincomes of participantsand nonparticipants,
E(YIZ = z) - E(YIZ = z')

is the change in per capita income resultingfrom the change in the policy from
z' to z.12 In terms of aggregateincome accounting,this parametermeasuresthe
per capita change in income from the policy. There is no reason to assume that
policies shift people unidirectionallyto participateor not to participatenor is
there any reason to expect that outcomes for participantsand nonparticipantsdo
not depend on Z. Thus neither IA-1 nor IA-2 are especially compellingassumptions in the context of evaluatingthe overall impact of a policy.
By placing some additionalstructureon the problem, we can link LATEto a
criterionthat is widely used in the literatureon microeconomicprogramevaluation and also establisha link with the discrete choice literature.Assume a binary
choice randomutility framework.Suppose that there are two choices (participaand that agentsmaketheirprogramparticipationchoices
tion or nonparticipation)
based on net utility. Assume that policies affect participantutility through an
term k(Z) that is assumed scalarand differentiable.Net weladditively-separable
fare W to the agent is
W = X + k(Z)
which clearly depends on the choice of z and z'. This example illustratesthe point that statistical
independenceof two randomvariablesdoes not implytheirfunctionalindependence.
12. The argumentin this section is developedin muchgreaterdetailin Heckmanand Smith(1997).

arisingfrom the movement of persons at the marginweighted by the proportion

from nonparticipantto participantstatus. The term in braces is a limit form of
the "local average treatmenteffect." The second set of terms is the change in
output within the two sectors resulting from the policy change. This term is
ignoredin many evaluation studies and is not incorporatedin the definitionof
the "causalparameters"definedby Imbensand Angrist.It describeshow people
who do not switch sectors are affected by the policy. The thirdterm is the direct
marginalsocial cost of the policy change, which is rarely estimated. At an optimum,A (z) = 0, providedstandardsecond orderconditionsare satisfied.Marginal
benefit should equal marginalcost.

= z)

The proof of this result is immediateonce it is recognizedthat the set X = - k(z)
is the indifferenceset. Thus, the LATEparameteris a marginalversion of the
conventional"treatmenton the treated"evaluationparameterfor gross outcomes
except now the parameterdepends on Z. This parameteris only one of the
ingredientsrequiredto producean evaluationof social welfareif per capitaGNP
(Gross National Product)is taken as the appropriatemeasureof social welfare.
Alternatively,LATE estimates only the gain from the policy to the persons induced to change participationstatus by the policy, and ignores the effect of the
variationin policy parameterz on inframarginalpersons and on social costs.
Instead of considering marginalsocial changes in a policy, it is sometimes
informativeto know the gross gain accruingto the economy from the existence
of a programat a level z comparedto the alternativeof shuttingit down. This
entails a comparisonacross programsand is what the parameter"treatmenton
the treated"is designedto estimate.The appropriatecriterionfor an all or nothing
evaluationof a policy at level Z = z is
A(z) = {Pr(D = l1Z = z)E(Y,ID = 1,Z = z)
+ Pr(D = |OZ = z)E(YoID = 0,Z = z)}
- c(z) - E(YoIZ = 0)

where Z = 0 correspondsto the case where there is no programand I assume
c(0) = 0. If A(z) > 0, total output is increased by establishingthe programat
level z. Observe that when Z = 0, no one participatesin the program,because
it is not available. A crucial simplifyingeconomic assumptionmakes it possible
to use outcomes in the no treatmentstate for a policy with Z = z to identify
outcomes in the no programstate (Z = 0). The assumptionis the absence of
generalequilibriumeffects.
Define D(z) to be the conditionalrandomvariableD given Z = z 0. In the
special case where the outcome in the benchmarkno programstate 0 is the same
whether or not the programexists, the absence of general equilibriumeffects
assumptionentails that
(13a) E(YoID(z) = 0,Z = z) = E(YolD(z) = 0,Z = 0)

and
(13b) E(YoID(z) = 1,Z = z) = E(YoID(z) = 1,Z = 0).

These expressions are defined, respectively, for persons who would not have
participated((13a) for D(z) = 0), or would have participated((13b) for D(z) =
1), in the programif it existed at level Z = z. Equation(13a) states that the mean
no treatmentoutcome for nonparticipantsin the state when there is a program

(at level Z = z) is the same as the mean no programoutcome for the same group
of persons who are nonparticipantsin the programwhen it exists. Equation(13b)
is a parallelassumptionfor participantsin treatmentwhen the programexists at
level Z = z. It asserts that their mean no treatmentoutcome underthe regimeZ
= z would have been what their mean no programoutcome would be under the
no policy regimeZ = 0 would be. D(z) identifiesparticipantsor nonparticipants
in the program(Z = z) regime. The second conditioningargumenton the right
hand side of (13a) and (13b) allows for the possibility that the level of the effect
depends on whetherZ = z or Z = 0, althoughthis dependence is ruled out by
virtueof assumptions(13a) and (13b).
Using the law of iterated expectations, and the assumptionthat participation
D(z) depends only on Z = z,
E(YIZ = 0) = E(Y0ID(z) = 1,Z = 0)Pr(D(z) = 1)
+ E(YoID(z) = 0,Z = 0)Pr(D(z) = 0).

Using the assumed absence of general equilibriumeffects as embodied in (13a)
and (13b), we obtain
(14) E(Y0oZ = 0) = E(Y0oD = 1, Z = z)Pr(D = 1 Z = z)
+ E(Yol D = 0,Z = z)Pr(D = 0IZ = z).

This decomposes E(YolZ = 0) into components attributableto persons who
wouldhave participatedin the programif it were availableand componentsattributableto those persons who would not have participatedin the programif it were
availableat level Z = z.
Using (14) to substitutefor E(Y0lZ = 0) in the definitionof A(z), we obtain
(15) A(z) = Pr(D = lZ = z)E(Y, - Yo\D = 1,Z = z) - c(z).

If redistributionis costless, the output-maximizingsolutionalso maximizessocial
welfare. For this importantcase, which is applicableto small-scale social programswith partialparticipation,the measure"treatmenton the treated"is vindicated provided that additionaldata on costs are collected. If Z only affects participationbut not outcomes, the traditionalmeasure is fully vindicatedbecause
E(yl - YojD = 1, Z = z) = E(yl - yolD = 1). For evaluating the effect of

"fine-tuning"existing programs,measure A(z) is more appropriate.All conventionalevaluationparametersabstractfromcost effects of the policies being evaluated, however, and this is a serious limitationof them.
Note that in principlenone of these policy parametersrequiremicro data for
their estimation. Knowing the impact of the programbeing evaluated on GNP
would suffice. Only the well known limitationsof using aggregatetime series data
to evaluatethe impactof a small scale programprevents one from using them to
identifythe impactof the program,and thus avoid the problemsof selection bias
in microdata.(See Heckmanand Smith 1997, for furtherdiscussion.)
The effect of randomly assigning persons in the population at large to the
programis rarelyof interest, except when coverage is universaland in that case
E(AIX) = E(AlX, D = 1). For that reason we do not discuss this parameter
furtherin this section.

VII. Extensions To The Case of Continuous
Treatment13
The previous analysis applies to the case where "treatment"is a
discretevariable.I now brieflyconsiderthe case where treatmentis a continuous
variable.For specificity,considera prototypicalmodel of the earnings-schooling
relationshippatternedalong the lines of Mincer (1974). Let y be earningsand S
be schooling, then
Iny = Ot+ ac S + V

whereE(V) = 0 and aI may vary amongpeople. As in the precedingsections, I
implicitlycondition on a set of variablesX. The cost of schooling consists of
foregone earningswhile in school plus direct costs c(S, Z, xl) where Z denotes
observed determinantsof c and -qrepresentsunobserveddeterminantsof c. To
representthe variabilityin al, write
E(e) = 0.

Assumingthat personsface discountrate r > 0 (whichmay vary amongpersons),

In this analysis p may vary amongpersons. To satisfy the second ordercondition
for an optimumthe additionalcondition, ai -r - p < 0 must be satisfied. Thus
0 < al - r < p is a restriction on al, r and 3 requiredto make the model
economicallymeaningful.
In this model, the "treatment"is S and for S = s*, the treated are implicitly
definedby (16). Thus persons who are treated at level S = s* are those persons
with characteristicsZ, rq,V, a,, r, and 3 such that (16) is satisfiedwith S = s*.
The mean effect of treatmenton the treatedfor persons at schooling level s* is

which is the same parameterif a, is a constant for everyone. In this case, the
second order condition is 0 < &l < p + r. In estimating &ain this case, least

squaresmay still be inconsistent, because of the dependencebetween V and S.
This can arise because of the dependence between V and the unobservablesin
(16) which include V. In this context, Z is a valid instrumentalvariableprovided
that E(VIZ) = 0. If a, is random and forecastable, at least in part, by Z, the
instrumentbreaks down for estimatingparameter(17) because
E(alIS* = s, 0 <a

When al is forecastable,the parametercorrespondingto the discrete outcome

dose of schooling.This parameterdoes not answer a well-posed economic question nor does it equal &aunless a, is a constant. The instrumentalvariables
estimatoris inconsistentfor the parameterin the generalcase when al is known
at the time schooling decisions are made because E(E S = s; Z = z) 5 0, and
so the instrumentalvariableconditionE(eSIZ = z) = 0 is not satisfied. If a1 is
unknownand people act on &d,then the parametercorrespondingto E(AIX) is
E(al) = &a.In this case, instrumentalvariablesis a consistent estimatorof &aif
E(VIZ) = 0. Assumptions about the informationavailable to the agent play a
crucial role in definingthe economically interpretableparametersand justifying
the applicationof instrumentalvariablesto estimate them.

VIII. Summary
Statisticalassumptionsmade in evaluationresearch are based on
behavioral
strong
assumptionseven thoughthey are often disguised. This paper
exposits how the methodof instrumentalvariablesthat is widely used to estimate
the impact of treatmenton the treated or the impact of treatmenton randomly
assignedpersons is based on the assumption(a) that persons with a given set of
observedcharacteristicsX respondidenticallyto treatmentor the assumption(b)
that if responses conditionalon X are heterogeneous,persons do not make their
decisionsto participatein the programbased on unobserved(by the analyst)components of programgains. This latter assumptionimplies a strongform of ignorance or irrationalityabout unobserved components of gain on the part of the
people being studied. It also impliesthat persons do not have privateinformation
that is useful in forecastingthe gains that they use in makingtheir decisions but
that is not availableto the analyst. If these implicationsare incorrect,the method
of instrumentalvariablesis inconsistentfor estimatingthe effect of treatmenton
the treated. We have also considered the analysis of the LATE parameterof
Imbensand Angrist.It is instrumentdependentand is definedon a hypothetical,
unobservablepopulation.For policy interventionsthat only induce some persons
to switch participationstatus and have no effects on nonswitchersand have no
direct social costs, however, a version of LATEproducesan economicallyinterpretableparameter-the effect of a marginalpolicy change on per capitaincome.
A parallelanalysisis presentedfor a modelof the effect of schoolingon earnings
in which "treatments"are continuous.The same distinctionsarise in this model,
except the effect of picking someone at randomand giving them schooling depends on whether the marginaltreatmenteffect is variable or not, and if it is
variable, whether or not it is anticipated, at least in part, when decisions to
participatein the programare made.
Manymethodsbesides instrumentalvariablemethodsare availablefor answering the evaluation questions considered in this paper. These methods do not
rely on the strongbehavioralassumptionsrequiredfor the correct applicationof
instrumentalvariablesin the case when response to treatmentis heterogeneous.
