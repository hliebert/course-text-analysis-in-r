MALE-FEMALE WAGE DIFFERENTIALS IN
URBAN LABOR MARKETS*
BY RONALD OAXACA1

CULTURE, TRADITION, AND OVERT DISCRIMINATIONtend to make restrictive the
terms by which women may participate in the labor force. These influences
combine to generate an unfavorable occupational distribution of female workers
vis-a-vis male workers and to create pay differences between males and females
within the same occupation. The result is a chronic earnings gap between male
and female full-time, year-round workers. Unfortunately, explanations at this
level of generality are mainly descriptive. It is the purpose of this paper to
estimate the average extent of discrimination against female workers in the United
States and to provide a quantitative assessment of the sources of male-female
wage differentials.

1. INTRODUCTION

In his study of sex differentials from the 1950 U. S. Census, Sanborn [13]
found the female/male annual income ratio to be .58 which implies a male-female
wage differential (as a proportion of the female wage) of .72. Sanborn's stated
objective was to consider discrimination only in the context of equal pay for
equal work and not to deal with discrimination stemming from occupational
barriers. Using both male and female adjustment weights, Sanborn adjusted the
income ratio for occupational distribution, annual hours of work, education,
urbanness, race, turnover, absenteeism, and work experience. In his attempt to
approximate equal work, Sanborn controlled for 262 detailed occupations. These
The residual difference
adjustments brought the income ratio up to .87-.88.
was therefore .13 and thus about 18%o of the original differential. As an estimate of the upper limits of the effects of discrimination it is rather low, but this
is not surprising in view of the aspect of discrimination under study.
Using data from the 1960 U. S. Census, Fuchs [6] calculated the hourly earnings of females relative to males to be .60 which implies a male-female wage
differential of .66. Fuchs does not believe that inherent differences in physical
strength account for the sizeable pay difference simply because jobs requiring
heavy labor are in a minority in the present day occupational structure. He
contended that role differentiation stemming from social attitudes and discrimination affects the determinants of earnings. The earnings ratio was raised to .66

after adjustments for color, schooling, age, city size, marital status, class of
worker, and length of trip to work. This adjusted ratio implies a residual differential of .51, which is 77%o'of the original differential. From the results of hlis
regressions of hourly earnings across occtupations,Fuchs concluded that nearly
all of the wage differential could be explained away if one chooses sufficiently
narrow occupational categories. As Fuchs observed, this merely casts the problem interms of why occupationial distributions are so differenetbetween males
and females.

In Cohen's study of sex differentials [5], an annual difference of $5,000 for
full-time employed males and females was calculated from a 1969 working conditions survey. Cohen adjusted the difference in pay by excluding those under
the age of 22 and over 64, the self-employed, persons without a steady job, and
professionals. He also adjusted for differences in annual hours worked, fringe
benefits, absenteeism, seniority, education, and unionization. The income difference was reduced to $2,550 or 51%o of the original difference. Cohen attributed this large residual to the concentration of women in lower paying jobs.
The Malkiels' study [9] of professional workers revealed male-female wage
differentials that ranged from .48 to .51 for the years 1966, 1969-1971. Adjustment for differences in schooling and experience yielded residual differentials
varying between 37%oto 49%oof the original wage differentials. For one of the
years the unexplained residual was reduced to only 3%oof the original wage
difference by adjusting for differences in schooling, experience, job level, critical
area of study, and publications. This clearly indicates that unequal pay for equal
work is not a significant source of discrimination. The problemllof discrimination centers around the assignment of job levels. The Malkiels found that 53%o
of the male-female difference in job levels couLld not be explained by differences
in personal characteristics.
2.

A MEASURE OF DISCRIMINATION

Discrimination against females can be said to exist whenever the relative wage
of males exceeds the relative wage that would have prevailed if males and females
were paid according to the same criteria. We can formalize this notion by proposing the concept of a discrimination coefficient (D) as a measure of discrimination:
( 1)

D=

Wm/Wf(WmlWf)0
(Wm/ Wf)0

where
(Wrn/Wf)

=

the observed male-female wage ratio;

and
(Wm/Wf)0

=

the male-female wage ratio in the absence of discrimination.

where MP,, and MPf are the marginal products of males and females, respectively.
In [2] Becker defined the market discrimination coefficient as the percentage
wage differential between two types of perfectly substitutable labor. For those
cases in which the two factors were not necessarily perfect substitutes, Becker
defined the discrimination coefficient as the simple difference between the observed wage ratio and the wage ratio in the absence of discrimination. The
discrimination. coefficient defined by (1) is simply Becker's generalized measure
divided by the wage ratio in the absence of discrimination. The generalized
measures admit perfect substitutes as a special case and thus afford more flexibility for empirical work.
3. ESTIMATION
PROCEDURES

Since (W,t,/Wf)0 is unknown, the estimation of D is equivalent to estimating
(W,1/ H/f)0. OJ1the basis of either of two assumptions, we can estimate the male-

female wage ratio that wotild exist in the absence of discrimination: If there
were no discrimination, 1) the wage struLcturecurrently faced by females would
also apply to males; or 2) the wage structure currently faced by males would
also apply to females. Assumption one (two) says that females (males) would
on average receive in the absenice of discrimination the same wages as they
presently receive, but that discriminationi takes the form of males (females)
receiving more (less) than a nondiscrimiinatinglabor market would award them.
Ordinary least squares estimation of a wage equation for any given group of
workers provides an estimate of the wage structure applicable to that group.

Our method of estimating the effects of discrimination involves the familiar

both the male and female regression weights establish a range of possible values.

SPECIFICATION OF THE CONTROL VARIABLES

In accordance with the post-schooling investment model of human capital
formation as developed in [8] and [10], a quadratic experience variable is included in the wage equations. The corresponding coefficients measure the
combined effects of the average rate of return to on-the-job training, the initial
proportion of time allocated to OJT, and the length of the investment horizon.
Since data on the actual number of years of work experience for a large sample of workers are generally unavailable, we define a proxy for actual work
experience:
(16)

XA,z A-

El-6

where
Xi = potential experience,
Ai = the age of the i-th individual,
Ei = the number of years of schooling completed by the i-th individual.
When work experience is acquired without interruption after the completion of
formal schooling, potential and actual experience coincide. Potential experience
is a reasonable proxy for actual experience in the case of males since males on
average exhibit a strong attachment to the labor force. However, potential
experience overstates the actual years of work experience of females to the extent
that many female workers have left the labor force for some period in the past
due to their household and childbearing activities. The difficulty this presents
for estimation is of course the errors in variables problem. It is not clear what
the net effect would be on our estimates of discrimination. It seems reasonable
to suppose that the potential experience-wage profile would be flatter than the
actual experience-wage profile. If the estimator of the coefficient on the linear
experience term were biased downward for females, then -48 would be biased
upward in this instance. Consequently, there would be a bias toward finding

discrimination.3
As a rough attempt to handle the problem of lost experieince, we have conitrolled for the ntumberof children (C) born to thle femadle. The linear childreni
variable reflects the cost of lost experience due to child care, including tlle costs
from the depreciation of skills during the periods of absenice from the labor
force. Accordingly, we expect the estimated coefficient (Pa)to lhave a negative
sign. There is some difficulty associated with the introdLuction of this variable
since it is obviously correlated with the proxy experience variable; however, in
the absence of data on actual work experience, the tuseof the children variable
seems justified.4
The remaining control variables are briefly described:
Education: years of schooling completed (linear and quadratic terms);
Class of Worker: dummy variables for union membership (privately employed
wage and salary worker), government employed, and self-employed with nonunion private wage and salary workers as the reference group;
Industry: dummy variables for U.S. Census two digit industries with retail
trade as the reference group;
Occupation: dummy variables for U.S. Census two digit occupations with
sales workers as the reference group;
Health Problems: dummy variable = 1 if the individual reports health problems that affect the kind or amount of work he or she can perform, and '0'
otherwise;
Part-Time: dummy variable = 1 if the individual works less than thirty-five
hours a week, and '0' otherwise;
I if the individual has maintained a resiMigration: a) dummy variable
dence more than fifty miles from hiis or her current address since the age of
seventeen, and '0' otherwise, b) YRSM: number of years since the individual
last migrated (linear and quadratic terms);
Marital Status: dummy variables for spouse present, spouse absent, widowed,
and divorced (or separated) with never married individuals as the reference
group;
Size of Urban Area: dummy variables for residence in Standard Metropolitan
Statistical Areas less than 250,000 (SMSA<250), greater than or equal to 250,000
but less than 500,000 (SMSA 250-500), greater than or equal to 500,000 but
less than 750,000 (SMSA 500-750), and greater than or equal to 750,000 (SMSA
750+) with urban, non-SMSA's as the reference group; and
Region: dummy variables for U.S. Census regions North East, North Central,
and West with South as the reference group.5
One difficulty with the present formulation of the wage equation is that
it controls for what niany would consider to be major sources of discrimilnation
3 These considerations also apply to wage models that specify an age variable in lieu of experience.
4 The consequences of omitting this variable are discussed in footnote 6.
5 The rationale for including most of these variables in a wage regression is fairly well known;
nevertheless a more detailed discussion is given in [11-1.

against women. By controlling for broadly defined occupation, we eliminate
some of the effects of occupational barriers as sources of discrimination. As a
result, we are likely to underestimate the effects of discrimination. Therefore,
we estimate another set of equations that do not control for occupation, industry,
and class of worker. We shall refer to this set of regressions as the personal
characteristics wage regressions, and to the original set as the full-scale wage
regressions.
It is clear that the magnitude of the estimated effects of discrimination crucially depends upon the choice of control variables for the wage regressions. A
researcher's choice of control variables implicitly reveals his or her attitude
toward what constitutes discrimination in the labor market. If it were possible
to control for virtually all sources of variation in wages, one could pretty well
eliminate labor market discrimination as a significant factor in determining wage
differentials by sex (or race). This is because SJ3,and therefore ln (D + 1), would
be very small. The result is that whatever the wage differential observed, it is
completely justified on the grounds of alleged productivity differences. The other
extreme is to control for virtually nothing and thereby minimize the role of
productivity differences, AZ. This is tantamount to declaring at the outset that
the two labor inputs are near perfect substitutes and therefore attributing virtually
all of the observed wage differential to labor market discrimination, i.e., relatively high valtuesof 48.
In reference to the type of regressioniapproaclhwe have adopted, it is impractical to control for detailed occupation. When we control for broadly defined two
digit categories, we are not assuming that the conditions of equal work are met.
Although the full-scale wage regressions eliminate male-female differences in
broad occupational attachment as possible sources of discrimination, they can
still reflect job and pay discrimination within each two digit category. The
personal characteristics wage equations were specified with the intention of examining the issue of equal pay for roughly similar personal characteristics and
not just for equal work.

EMPIRICAL RESULTS

The data for the study are from the 1967 Survey of Economic Opportunity.
The particular subsample used for this study consists of the intersection of the
following sets: those individuals who show an hourly wage for the week preceding the survey; adults sixteen years or older; those who live in urban areas; and
those who report their race as either White or Negro.
The regression coefficients corresponding to the full-scale and personal characteristics wage equations are presented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Coefficients were not estimated in the following cases: 1) the particular characteristic
served as the base group; 2) there were no observations in a particular cell: 3)
the same observations were found in another cell; or 4) the regressor was left
out on the basis of poor results from earlier regressions. The joint tests of significance for Aj9in both the full-scale and personal characteristics wage regressions

parison of our results with those of other studies, the wage differential G is also
calculated. The value of G is .54 for whites and .49 for blacks.
The effects of discrimination are approximated by the residual left after subtracting the effects of differences in individual characteristics from the overall
wage differential. The calculations based on the full-scale wage regressionsare
presented in Table 3. As a simple average of the two estimates obtained, discrimination accounts for 58.4%o of the logarithmic wage differential for whites
and 55.6%o for blacks. The average value of the discrimination coefficient is .29
for whites and .25 for blacks. Table 4 presents the effects of discrimination
calculated from the personal characteristics wage regressions. Predictably, the
estimated effects of discrimination are larger than those reported in Table 3:
Discrimination accounts for approximately 77.7%oof the wage diffferential for
whites and 93.6%o for blacks. The averaged estimates of the discrimination
coefficient are .40 and .45 for whites and blacks, respectively. Under botlh
sets of r-egressionsand for both races, sex differences in the distribution of
part-time employment and marital status significantly contributed to a narrowing of the wage differential. It is evident from Tables 1 and 2 that workers with
spouse present tend to earn more than others even after controlling for other
factors. A smaller proportion of women workers fall into the category of spouse
present, and therefore this difference reduces the wage differential due to discrimination. The difference probably reflects the competing activities of production in the home. In the case of whites, the effects of childbearing also narrow

the differential. Differences in the mean years of schooling completed widens
the differential for blacks because black females comnpleteon average almost a
fuLllyear miioreof schooliilg than black imiales. It is clear fromiiTable 3 that sex
differences in the distributions by class of worker, induistry, anid occupation
signiificanitlynarrow the wage differential even though industry and occupation
are represented by highly aggregated categories.
Slpacelimitations permiiitdiscussion of only a few selected aspects of the regression coeflicients reported in Tables I and 2. The estimated experience coefficients ulnder botlh sets of regressions imply that for the samnerate of returnito
OJT, males invest more initially and for a longer period. If both sexes invest
the same initially, then the pattern of differences in the coefficients imply that
males earn a higher rate of return and invest for a longer period than females.
The coefficients on the children variable indicate that each child lowers the white
female wage by 2 or 3%0but has a negligible effect on the black female wage.6
This may suggest tllat black females do not stay out of the labor force as long
as white females for each child born.] Our results are consistent with those
studies of labor supply, such as [3] and [4], that find that the presence of children
inhibits the labor force participation of white females significantly more than
for black females. Perhaps some form of extended family arrangement in black
communities provides a ready source of child care for working mothers. It may
also be that lost experience and acquired skills are not very important in the
kinds of jobs black females typically

hold.

For example,

52%o of the black

The personal characteristics wage equations were also estimated without the children variable.
Generally, the positive coefficients were reduced in magnitude and the negative coefficients became larger in absolute value. Consequently, -.J4 was biased upward, which implies a larger
estimated effect of discrimination.
I The cost of children in terms of their effect on the hourly wage can be translated into an
equivalent number of years of potential experience; l) Set the estimated female experience profile minus the children term equal to zero; and 2) Solve the resulting quadratic for the negative
root. Let RI be the negative root of

/2X2

+ /IXX-

,C = 0.

The absolute value ARl is an estimate of the equivalent number of years of experience. The
mean number of children per white female was 1.6. Using the coefficients from the personal
characteristics wage regressions, we evaluated RII at C= 1.6. The value of R II was approximately 2.5 years. As an estimate of the number of years of experience lost to child care, 2.5
years seems low. Yet this may be a reasonable estimate when one considers that ours is a sample
of employed females. A sample from the total population of adult females would include mothers
not in the labor force. The years of actual work experience lost would be higher for such a
sample. Since we are interested in the average years of lost experience for all employed females,
the estimate of 1.6 children per female was computed using the total number of females. However the sample includes women who have never had chidren. Thus the mean number of children per mother and the estimate of their lost experience would be higher. The average ages
of white males and females in our sample were 39.5 and 38.9 years, respectively. The average
difference in potential experience was 0.6 years. When 0.6 is added to the estimated 2.5 years.
we have a total estimated male-female experience difference of 3.1 years. In the Malkiels' study
[9, (24)] the difference in actual work experience was 2.9 years in 1971 for males and females
whose average ages were 40.8 and 38.9 years, respectively. Another independent source [14,
(94)] shows that the difference in years of employment covered by Social Security was 3.2 years
in 1960 between males and females in the 35-39 age group.

As in other studies we find the sex differential to be quite large. We are in
agreement with other researchersthat unequal pay for equal work does not account for very much of the male-female wage differential. Rather it is the concentrationi of women in lower paying jobs that produces such large differentials.
Our results suggest that a substantial proportion of the male-female wage differential is attributable to the effects of discrimination.
The effects of discrimination are estimated as the residual left after adjusting
the sex differential for differences in various characteristics. This methodological technique is found in other studies as well and may take the form of regression analysis or standardization analysis. There are some difficulties with this
general approach which should be mentioned. Could it be that the wage structures for males and females would differ even in the absence of discrimination?
For example, male-female differences in the coefficients of the experience variable
suggest that the rate of return to OJT may be higher for males, and/or females
invest less in OJT. One might argue that even in the absence of discrimination
females may plan on a shorter working life and hence invest less than men. The
result would be a difference in the parameters of the experience variables, yet
these differences contribute to the effects of discrimination under our analysis.
In defense of this approach it should be pointed out that occupational barriers
againistwomen deny them the opportunities to invest to the same extent as men.
Also, the short work life expectancy of women may represent a rational response
to anticipated discrimination in the labor market. The issue becomes onle of
how much of the male-female difference in the coefficients is due to discrimination.
Another difficulty with the residual approach is that it does not take into account the effects of the feedback from labor market discrimination on the malefemale differences in the selected individual characteristics. The differences
could reflect the adaptation of women to the biases of the labor market; yet
under the residual approach all differences in the characteristics contribute to a
reduction of the wage differential attributable to discrimination. The problem
becomes one of how much of the observed differences in individual characteristics would exist in the absence of discrimination.
These very difficult problems have not been dealt with in this study, but
they are clearly important in terms of policy prescriptions for narrowing the
male-female wage differential.
