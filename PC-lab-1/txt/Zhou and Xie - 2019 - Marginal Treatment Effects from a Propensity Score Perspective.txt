We offer a propensity score perspective to interpret and analyze the
marginal treatment effect (MTE). Specifically, we redefine MTE as the
expected treatment effect conditional on the propensity score and a latent variable representing unobserved resistance to treatment. As with
the original MTE, the redefined MTE can be used as a building block
for constructing standard causal estimands. The weights associated with
the new MTE, however, are simpler, more intuitive, and easier to compute. Moreover, the redefined MTE immediately reveals treatment effect heterogeneity among individuals at the margin of treatment, enabling us to evaluate a wide range of policy effects.

characteristics but also in how they respond to a particular treatment, intervention, or stimulation. Moreover, individuals may self-select into treatment on the basis of their anticipated treatment effects in a way that is
not captured by observed covariates. This is likely when individuals (or
their agents) possess more knowledge than the researcher about their
gains (or losses) from treatment and act on it (Roy 1951; Björklund and
Moffitt 1987; Heckman and Vytlacil 2007a). To study heterogeneous treatment effects in the presence of unobserved self-selection, Heckman and
Vytlacil (1999, 2001a, 2005, 2007b) have developed a structural approach
that builds on the marginal treatment effect (MTE). Under a latent index
model of treatment assignment, the MTE is defined as the expected treatment effect given observed covariates and a latent variable representing
unobserved, individual-specific resistance to treatment. A wide range of
causal parameters, such as the average treatment effect (ATE) and the
treatment effect of the treated (TT), can be expressed as weighted averages of MTE. Moreover, MTE can be used to evaluate ATEs for individuals
at the margin of indifference to treatment, thus allowing the researcher to
assess the efficacy of marginal policy changes (Carneiro, Heckman, and
Vytlacil 2010, 2011).
In the MTE framework, the latent index model ensures that all unobserved determinants of treatment status are summarized by a single latent
variable and that the variation of treatment effect by this latent variable
captures all of the unobserved treatment effect heterogeneity that may
cause selection bias. Our basic intuition is that, under this model, treatment effect heterogeneity that is consequential for selection bias occurs
only along two dimensions: (1) the observed probability of treatment
(i.e., the propensity score) and (2) the latent variable for unobserved resistance to treatment. In other words, after unobserved selection is factored
in through the latent variable, the propensity score is the only dimension
along which treatment effect may be correlated with treatment status.
Therefore, to identify population- and subpopulation-level causal effects,
such as ATE and TT, it would be sufficient to model treatment effect as a
bivariate function of the propensity score and the latent variable. In this
paper, we show that such a bivariate function is not only analytically sufficient but also crucial to the evaluation of policy effects.
Specifically, we redefine MTE as the expected treatment effect conditional on the propensity score (instead of the entire vector of observed covariates) and the latent variable representing unobserved resistance to
treatment. This redefinition offers a novel perspective to interpret and analyze MTE that supplements the current approach. First, although projected onto a unidimensional summary of covariates, the redefined MTE
is sufficient to capture all of the treatment effect heterogeneity that is consequential for selection bias. Thus, as with the original MTE, it can also
be used as a building block for constructing standard causal parameters,

such as ATE and TT. The weights associated with the new MTE, however,
are simpler, more intuitive, and easier to compute. Second, by discarding
treatment effect variation that is orthogonal to the two-dimensional space
spanned by the propensity score and the latent variable, the redefined
MTE is a bivariate function, easier to visualize than the original MTE. Finally, the redefined MTE immediately reveals treatment effect heterogeneity among individuals who are at the margin of treatment. As a result,
it can be used to evaluate a wide range of policy effects with little analytical twist and to design policy interventions that optimize the marginal
benefits of treatment. To facilitate practice, we also provide an R package,
localIV, for estimating the redefined MTE as well as the original MTE via
local instrumental variables (LIVs; Zhou 2019).
Of course, this paper is not the first to characterize the selection problem using the propensity score. Since the seminal work of Rosenbaum and
Rubin (1983), propensity-score-based methods, such as matching, weighting, and regression adjustment, have been a mainstay strategy for drawing
causal inferences in the social sciences. In a series of papers, Heckman and
colleagues have established the key roles of the propensity score in a variety of econometric methods, including matching, control functions, instrumental variables (IVs), and the MTE approach (Heckman and Robb
1986; Heckman and Hotz 1989; Heckman and Navarro-Lozano 2004;
Heckman 2010). In the MTE approach, for example, incremental changes
in the propensity score serve as LIVs that identify the MTE at various values
of the unobserved resistance to treatment. Moreover, the weights with
which MTE can be aggregated up to standard causal parameters depend
solely on the conditional distribution of the propensity score given covariates. In this paper, we show that the propensity score offers not only a tool
for identification but also a perspective from which we can better summarize, interpret, and analyze treatment effect heterogeneity due to both
observed and unobserved characteristics.
II. MTEs: A Review
The MTE approach builds on the generalized Roy model for discrete
choices (Roy 1951; Heckman and Vytlacil 2007a). Consider two potential
outcomes, Y1 and Y0; a binary indicator for treatment status, D; and a vector of pretreatment covariates, X. The variable Y1 denotes the potential outcome if the individual were treated (D 5 1), and Y0 denotes the
potential outcome if the individual were not treated (D 5 0). We specify
the outcome equations as
Y0 5 m0 ðX Þ 1 e,

(1)

Y1 5 m1 ðX Þ 1 e 1 h,

where m0 ðX Þ 5 E½Y0 jX , m1 ðX Þ 5 E½Y1 jX , the error term e captures all unobserved factors that affect the baseline outcome (Y0), and the error
term h captures all unobserved factors that affect the treatment effect
(Y1 2 Y0 ). Treatment assignment is represented by a latent index model.
Let ID be a latent tendency for treatment, which depends on both observed (Z ) and unobserved (V ) factors:
ID 5 mD ðZ Þ 2 V,

(3)

D 5 IðID > 0Þ,

(4)

where mD(Z ) is an unspecified function and V is a latent random variable
representing unobserved, individual-specific resistance to treatment, assumed to be continuous with a strictly increasing distribution function.
The Z vector includes all of the components of X, but it also includes IVs
that affect only the treatment status D. The key assumptions associated
with equations (1)–(4) are as follows:
Assumption 1 (Independence). ðe, h, V Þ are statistically independent of Z given X.
Assumption 2 (Rank condition). mD(Z ) is a nontrivial function of Z
given X.
The latent index model characterized by equations (3) and (4), combined with assumptions 1 and 2, is equivalent to the Imbens and Angrist
(1994) assumptions of independence and monotonicity for the interpretation of IV estimands as local ATEs (LATEs; Vytlacil 2002).
To define the MTE, it is best to rewrite the treatment assignment equations (3) and (4) as
D 5 IðFV jX ðmD ðZ ÞÞ 2 FV jX ðV Þ > 0Þ
5 IðP ðZ Þ 2 U > 0Þ,

(5)

where FV jX ðÞ is the cumulative distribution function of V given X and
P ðZ Þ 5 PrðD 5 1jZ Þ 5 FV jX ðmD ðZ ÞÞ denotes the propensity score given
Z. The expression U 5 FV jX ðV Þ is the quantile of V given X, which by definition follows a standard uniform distribution. From equation (5) we
can see that Z affects treatment status only through the propensity score
P(Z ). The MTE is defined as the expected treatment effect conditional
on pretreatment covariates X 5 x and the normalized latent variable

Since U is the quantile of V, the variation of MTEðx, uÞ over values of u
reflects how treatment effect varies with different quantiles of the unobserved resistance to treatment.
A wide range of causal parameters, such as ATE and TT, can be expressed
as weighted averages of MTEðx, uÞ. To obtain population-level causal effects, MTEðx, uÞ needs to be integrated twice, first over u given X 5 x and
then over x. The weights for integrating over u are detailed in Heckman,
Urzua, and Vytlacil (2006a). It bears noting that the estimation of weights
can be challenging in practice (except for the ATE case), as it involves estimating the conditional density of P(Z ) given X and the latter is usually a
high-dimensional vector.
Given assumptions 1 and 2, MTEðx, uÞ can be nonparametrically identified using the method of LIVs.1 Specifically, for any ðx, uÞ within the support of the joint distribution of X and P(Z ), MTEðx, uÞ can be identified
as the partial derivative of E½Y jX 5 x, P ðZ Þ 5 p with respect to p:

∂E½Y jX 5 x, P ðZ Þ 5 p  
MTEðx, u Þ 5
 :

∂p
p5u
In practice, however, it is difficult to condition on X nonparametrically,
especially when X is high-dimensional. Therefore, in most empirical
work using LIV, it is assumed that ðX , Z Þ is jointly independent of ðe, h, V Þ
(e.g., Carneiro and Lee 2009; Carneiro et al. 2011; Maestas, Mullen, and
Strand 2013). Under this assumption, the MTE is additively separable in x
and u:
MTEðx, u Þ 5 m1 ðx Þ 2 m0 ðx Þ 1 E½hjX 5 x, U 5 u 
5 m1 ðx Þ 2 m0 ðx Þ 1 E½hjU 5 u :

(6)

The additive separability not only simplifies estimation but also allows
MTEðx, uÞ to be identified over suppðX Þ  suppðP ðZ ÞÞ (instead of
suppðX , P ðZ ÞÞ). The above equation also suggests a necessary and sufficient condition for the MTE to be additively separable:
Assumption 3 (Additive separability). E½hjX 5 x, U 5 u does not depend on x.
This assumption is implied by (but does not imply) the full independence between ðX , Z Þ and ðe, h, V Þ (for a similar discussion, see Brinch
et al. [2017]).
In most applied work, the conditional means of Y0 and Y1 given X are
further specified as linear in parameters: m0 ðX Þ 5 bT0 X and m1 ðX Þ 5 bT1 X .
In this case, E½Y jX 5 x, P ðZ Þ 5 p can be written as
1
An alternative method to nonparametrically identify the MTE is based on separate
estimation of E½Y jP ðZ Þ, X , D 5 0 and E½Y jP ðZ Þ, X , D 5 1 (see Heckman and Vytlacil
2007b; Brinch, Mogstad, and Wiswall 2017).

III. A Redefinition of MTE
Under the generalized Roy model, a single latent variable U not only
summarizes all unobserved determinants of treatment status but also
captures all the treatment effect heterogeneity by unobserved characteristics that may cause selection bias. In fact, the latent index structure implies that all the treatment effect heterogeneity that is consequential for
selection bias occurs along only two dimensions: (1) the propensity score
P(Z ) and (2) the latent variable U representing unobserved resistance to
treatment. This is directly reflected in equation (5): a person is treated if
and only if her propensity score exceeds her (realized) latent resistance
u. Therefore, given both P(Z ) and U, treatment status D is fixed (either 0
or 1) and thus independent of treatment effect:
Y1 2 Y0 ╨ DjP ðZ Þ, U:
Thus, to characterize selection bias, it is sufficient to model treatment effect as a bivariate function of the propensity score and the latent variable
U. We redefine MTE as the expected treatment effect given P(Z ) and U:

MTE
g
Compared with the original MTE, MTEðp,
uÞ is a more parsimonious representation of all the treatment effect heterogeneity that is relevant for selection bias. Moreover, by discarding treatment effect variation that is org
thogonal to the two-dimensional space spanned by P(Z ) and U, MTEðp,
uÞ is a bivariate function, easier to visualize than MTEðx, uÞ.

constructing standard causal parameters, such as ATE and TT. However,

When the analysis is conditional on X and the instruments Z nX are discrete, P(Z ) can
take only a finite number of values. In this case, functional form restrictions have to be imposed on P(Z ). See Brinch et al. (2017).

To construct TT(p), we integrate MTEðp,

population-level ATE, TT, and TUT, we further integrate ATE(p), TT(p),
and TUT(p) against appropriate marginal distributions of P(Z ). For example, to construct TT, we integrate TT(p) against the marginal distribution of the propensity score among treated units.

IV. Identification and Estimation of MTEðp,
uÞ
g
As with MTEðx, uÞ, the regions over which MTEðp,
uÞ is identified depend
on whether assumption 3 (additive separability) is invoked.4 Let us first
look at the case without additive separability. From assumption 1, we know
that U ╨ P ðZ ÞjX . Since U follows a standard uniform distribution for
each X 5 x, we also have U ╨ X . By the rules of conditional independence, we have U ╨ X jP ðZ Þ. Using this fact and the law of total expectag
tion, we can write MTEðp,
uÞ as
g ðp, u Þ 5 EX jP ðZ Þ5p,U 5u E½Y1 2 Y0 jP ðZ Þ 5 p, U 5 u, X 

Thus, MTEðp,
uÞ is no more than the conditional expectation of MTEðx,
uÞ given P ðZ Þ 5 p. As discussed above, with assumptions 1 and 2, MTEðx,
uÞ is identified over the support of the joint distribution of X and P(Z ).
Thus, for a given u, MTEðx, uÞ is identified if and only if x ∈ suppðX j
g
P ðZ Þ 5 uÞ. Yet to evaluate MTEðp,
uÞ from equation (8), we need to know
MTEðx, uÞ for all x ∈ suppðX jP ðZ Þ 5 pÞ. Therefore, for a given ðp, uÞ pair,
g
uÞ if suppðX jP ðZ Þ 5 pÞ ⊆ suppðX jP ðZ Þ 5 uÞ.
we can identify MTEðp,
For general p ≠ u, this condition can be quite restrictive. However, for

When P ðZ Þ 5 p is treated as a random variable, weights of the same form as in table 1
can be used to construct population-level causal parameters directly from MTEðx, uÞ (see

As we will see, it plays a prominent role in the evaluation of policy effects.
When assumption 3 is invoked (as in most empirical work with MTE),
MTEðx, uÞ is identified for any ðx, uÞ ∈ suppðX Þ  suppðP ðZ ÞÞ. That is,
for each u ∈ suppðP ðZ ÞÞ, MTEðx, uÞ is identified over the marginal support of X. Thus, for any ðp, uÞ ∈ suppðP ðZ ÞÞ  suppðP ðZ ÞÞ, we can ideng
tify MTEðp,
uÞ through equation (8). Since MTEðx, uÞ can now be partitioned into a function of x and a function of u, evaluation of equation (8)
will be straightforward. For example, when m0 ðX Þ and m1 ðX Þ are specified
as linear in parameters, MTEðx, uÞ can be estimated as equation (7). To
g
obtain estimates of MTEðp,
uÞ, we need only one more step: fit a nonpara^0 ÞT x with respect to p^ (e.g., using a local linear re^

V. Policy-Relevant Causal Effects
The redefined MTE can be used not only to construct standard causal
parameters but also, in the context of program evaluation, to draw implications for the ways in which the program should be revised in the future.
To predict the impact of an expansion (or a contraction) in program
participation, one needs to examine treatment effects for those individuals who would be affected by such an expansion (or contraction). To formalize this idea, Heckman and Vytlacil (2001b, 2005) define the policyrelevant treatment effect (PRTE) as the mean effect of moving from a
baseline policy to an alternative policy per net person shifted into treatment; that is,

They further show that under the generalized Roy model, the PRTE depends on a policy change only through its impacts on the distribution of
the propensity score P(Z ). Specifically, conditional on X 5 x, the PRTE
can be written as a weighted average of MTEðx, uÞ, where the weights depend only on the distribution of P(Z ) before and after the policy change.
Within this framework, Carneiro et al. (2010) further define the marginal
PRTE (MPRTE) as a directional limit of the PRTE as the alternative policy
converges to the baseline policy. Denoting by F(⋅) the cumulative distribution function of P(Z ), they consider a set of alternative policies indexed by a scalar a, fFa : a ∈ Rg such that F0 corresponds to the baseline
policy. The MPRTE is defined as
MPRTE 5 lim PRTEðFa Þ:
a→0

We follow their approach to analyzing policy effects but without conditioning on X. While Carneiro et al. (2010) assume that the effects of all
policy changes are through shifts in the conditional distribution of P(Z )
given X, we focus on policy changes that shift the marginal distribution
of P(Z ) directly. In other words, we consider policy interventions that incorporateindividual-level treatment effectheterogeneity by valuesof P(Z ),
whether their differences in P(Z ) are determined by their baseline characteristics X or the IVs Z nX . In a companion paper (Zhou and Xie, forthcoming), we provide a more detailed comparison between these two
approaches.
Specifically, let us consider a class of policy changes under which the
ith individual’s propensity of treatment is boosted by l(pi) (in a way that
does not change her treatment effect), where pi denotes her propensity
score P(zi) and l(⋅) is a positive, real-valued function such that p 1 lðpÞ ≤
1 for all p ∈ ½0, 1Þ. Thus, the policy change nudges everyone in the same
direction, and two persons with the same baseline probability of treatment
share an inducement of the same size. For such a policy change, the PRTE
given P ðZ Þ 5 p < 1 and l(p) becomes

marginal treatment effects: a propensity score perspective 3079
To examine the effects of marginal policy changes, let us consider a sequence of policy changes indexed by a real-valued scalar a. Given P ðZ Þ 5
p, we define the MPRTE as the limit of PRTEðp, alðpÞÞ as a approaches
zero:

Hence, we have established a direct link between MPRTE(p) and MTEðp,
g at
uÞ: at each level of the propensity score, the MPRTE is simply the MTE
the margin where u 5 p. As shown in the last row of table 1, MPRTE(p)
g
can also be expressed as a weighted average of MTEðp,
uÞ using the Dirac
delta function. This quantity, as noted in the previous section, can be
nonparametrically identified even without the assumption of additive
separability.
The relationships between ATE, TT, TUT, and MPRTE are graphically
g
illustrated in figure 1. Figure 1A shows a shaded gray plot of MTEðp,
uÞ
for heterogeneous treatment effects in a hypothetical setup. In this plot,
both the propensity score p and the latent resistance u (both ranging from
0 to 1) are divided into 10 equally spaced strata, yielding 100 grids, and
a darker grid indicates a higher treatment effect. The advantage of such
a shaded gray plot is that we can use subsets of the 100 grids to represent
meaningful subpopulations. For example, we present the grids for treated
units in figure 1B, untreated units in figure 1C, and marginal units in figure 1D. Thus, evaluating ATE, TT, TUT, and MPRTE simply means takg
ing weighted averages of MTEðp,
uÞ over the corresponding subsets of grids.
VI.

Treatment Effect Heterogeneity
among Marginal Entrants

For policy makers, a key question of interest would be how MPRTE(p)
varies with the propensity score p. To gain some intuition, let us consider
the functional structure of MPRTE(p) under the assumption of additive
separability. Substituting equation (6) into equation (8), we can see that
MPRTE(p) consists of two components:
MPRTEðp Þ 5 E½m1 ðX Þ 2 m0 ðX ÞjP ðZ Þ 5 p  1 E½ðhjU 5 p Þ:

(9)

The first component reflects treatment effect heterogeneity by the propensity score, and the second component reflects treatment effect heterogeneity by the latent resistance U. Among marginal entrants, P(Z ) is
equal to U so that these two components fall on the same dimension.

To see how the two components combine to shape MPRTE(p), let us
revisit the classic example on the economic returns to college. In the labor economics literature, a negative association has often been found between h and U, suggesting a pattern of “positive selection”; that is, individuals who benefit more from college are more motivated than their peers
to attend college (e.g., Willis and Rosen 1979; Blundell, Dearden, and Sianesi 2005; Moffitt 2008; Carneiro et al. 2011; Heckman, Humphries, and
Veramendi 2016). In this case, the second component of equation (9)
would be a decreasing function of p. On the other hand, the literature
has not paid much attention to the first component, concerning whether
individuals who by observed characteristics are more likely to attend college also benefit more from college. A number of observational studies
have suggested that nontraditional students, such as racial and ethnic minorities or students from less educated families, experience higher returns to college than traditional students, although interpretation of such
findings remains controversial because of potential unobserved selection

biases (e.g., Bowen and Bok 1998; Attewell and Lavin 2007; Maurin and
McNally 2008; Brand and Xie 2010; Dale and Krueger 2011). However, if
the downward slope in the second component were sufficiently strong,
MPRTE(p) would also decline with p. In this case, we would paradoxically
observe a pattern of “negative selection”: among students who are at the
margin of attending college, those who by observed characteristics are less
likely to attend college would actually benefit more from college.
To better understand the paradoxical implication of self-selection, let
us revisit figure 1. From figure 1A, we can see that in the hypothetical
data, treatment effect declines with u at each level of the propensity score,
suggesting an unobserved self-selection. In other words, individuals may
have self-selected into treatment on the basis of their anticipated gains.
On the other hand, at each level of the latent variable u, treatment effect
increases with the propensity score, indicating that individuals who by observed characteristics are more likely to be treated also benefit more from
the treatment. This relationship, however, is reversed among the marginal
entrants. As shown in figure 1D, among the marginal entrants, those who
appear less likely to be treated (bottom left grids) have higher treatment
effects. This pattern of negative selection at the margin, interestingly, is
exactly due to an unobserved positive selection into treatment.
VII.

Policy as a Weighting Problem

In Section V, we used l(p) to denote the increment in treatment probability at each level of the propensity score p. Since MPRTE(p) is defined
as the pointwise limit of PRTEðp, alðpÞÞ as a approaches zero, the mathematical form of l(p) does not affect MPRTE(p). However, in deriving the
population-level (i.e., unconditional) MPRTE, we need to use l(p) as the
appropriate weight. To see this, let us consider the overall PRTE for a given
a. Since the size of inducement al(p) reflects the share of individuals
who are induced into treatment (“compliers”) given P ðZ Þ 5 p, the overall
PRTE is a weighted average of PRTEðp, alðpÞÞ with weights al(p):

alðp Þ dFP ðp Þ

lðp ÞPRTEðp, alðp ÞÞ dFP ðp Þ
,
ð1
lðp Þ dFP ðp Þ

where FP(⋅) denotes the marginal distribution function of the propensity
score. We then define the population-level MPRTE as the limit of PRTEa

as a approaches zero. Under some regularity conditions,5 we can take the
limit inside the integral:
MPRTE 5 lim PRTEa

lðp ÞMPRTEðp Þ dFP ðp Þ
:
ð1
lðp Þ dFP ðp Þ
0

Thus, given the estimates of MPRTE(p), a policy maker may apply the
above formula to design an expression for l(⋅) to boost the populationlevel MPRTE. For example, if it were found that the marginal return to college declines with the propensity score p, a college expansion targeted at
students with lower values of p (say, a means-tested financial aid program)
would be more effective overall than a uniform expansion of college attendance in the population (Zhou and Xie, forthcoming).6
In practice, for a given policy l(p), we can evaluate the above integral
directly from sample data, using
MPRTE ≈

o MPRTEðp^ Þlðp^ Þ ,
o lðp^ Þ
i

where p^i is the estimated propensity score for unit i in the sample. When
the sample is not representative of the population by itself, sampling
weights need to be incorporated in these summations.
VIII. Conclusion
Through a redefinition of MTE using the propensity score, we presented
a new perspective to interpret and analyze heterogeneous treatment effects in the presence of unobserved selection. The redefined MTE treats
observed and unobserved selection symmetrically and parsimoniously

A sufficient (but not necessary) condition is that MTEðp,
uÞ is bounded over ½0, 1

½0, 1. By the mean value theorem, PRTEðp, alðpÞÞ can be written as MTEðp,
p * Þ, where
p * ∈ ½p, p 1 alðpÞ. Thus, PRTEðp, alðpÞÞ is also bounded. By the dominated convergence
theorem, the limit can be taken inside the integral.

Admittedly, the discussion here provides no more than a theoretical guide to practice.
In the real world, designing specific policy instruments to produce a target form of l(p)
can be a challenging task.

marginal treatment effects: a propensity score perspective 3083
summarizes all of the treatment effect heterogeneity that is relevant for
selection bias. As with the original MTE, the redefined MTE can serve as
a building block for evaluating aggregate causal effects. Yet the weights
associated with the new MTE are simpler, more intuitive, and easier to
compute. Finally, the new MTE immediately reveals treatment effect heterogeneity among individuals who are at the margin of treatment, thus
enabling us to design more cost-effective policy interventions.
