Survival-related Selection Bias in Studies
of Racial Health Disparities
The Importance of the Target Population and Study Design
Chanelle J. Howe,a and Whitney R. Robinsonb,c
Abstract: The impact of survival-related selection bias has not always
been discussed in relevant studies of racial health disparities. Moreover,
the analytic approaches most frequently employed in the epidemiologic
literature to minimize selection bias are difficult to implement appropriately in racial disparities research. This difficulty stems from the
fact that frequently employed analytic techniques require that common
causes of survival and the outcome are accurately measured. Unfortunately, such common causes are often unmeasured or poorly measured
in racial health disparities studies. In the absence of accurate measures of
the aforementioned common causes, redefining the target population or
changing the study design represents a useful approach for reducing the
extent of survival-related selection bias. To help researchers recognize
and minimize survival-related selection bias in racial health disparities
studies, we illustrate the aforementioned selection bias and how redefining the target population or changing the study design can be useful.

arise under the scenario where the early-life exposure influences whether an individual lives long enough to be a study
participant and a common cause of survival and the outcome
exists. Although race (defined at conception or birth) can
be considered to be an early-life exposure,2,3 the aforementioned selection bias has not always been explicitly discussed
in relevant applied studies of racial health disparities.4–7 This
lack of discussion may in part be attributed to race being an
ill-defined exposure8 and less frequently conceived of as an
early-life exposure.
Even if this survival-related selection bias is recognized
in a study of racial health disparities, analytic approaches
most often employed in the epidemiologic literature to minimize selection bias (e.g., inverse probability weighting8–10)
require that the aforementioned common cause be accurately
measured. However, common causes that might be most relevant to studying racial health disparities later in life may be
unmeasured or poorly measured because they may also be
early-life factors or are difficult to measure (e.g., childhood
socioeconomic position).11,12 Even if such common causes are
accurately measured, the appropriateness of using techniques
such as inverse probability weighting to minimize selection
bias related to death has been debated in the literature8,10,13,14
because death can be considered to be a competing risk/event.
Given the vulnerability of analytic approaches such as inverse
probability weighting to unmeasured or poorly measured
common causes and debates surrounding their use in this setting, careful consideration of the target population and study
design emerge as useful strategies for minimizing survivalrelated selection bias. To help researchers recognize and minimize survival-related selection bias in racial health disparities
studies, we provide an example of the abovementioned selection bias and how redefining the target population or changing
the study design can help.

EXAMPLE
Let the target population be defined as the population to
whom inference is to be made. Furthermore, the study population is defined as a subset of the target population that is
obtained by sampling from the target population and used to
make inference about the target population. Now suppose that

FIGURE. Causal diagram for the target and study population
in the researcher’s original cross-sectional study that depicts
the relationship between race and Z infection, where S = 1 is
an indicator of remaining alive in the target population to be
included in the study population, U is an unmeasured factor,
and a box denotes conditioning. In the researcher’s original
cross-sectional study, the target population is Black and White
residents of City X born in 1936 and the study population is
all Black and White City X residents who were born in 1936
and were living when study enrollment occurs in 2016. If the
target population in the researcher’s study were simply redefined (i.e., changed) to be the study population (i.e., Black and
White City X residents who were born in 1936 and are living at
enrollment in 2016), then S = 1 is now an indicator of remaining alive in City X to be included in both the target population
and study population.

a researcher aims to study the effect of race (defined at birth)
on infection with virus Z in the target population: Black and
White residents of City X born in 1936. In 2016 the researcher
conducts a cross-sectional study that enrolls all living Black
and White City X residents born in 1936. The researcher
assesses the Z status of enrollees. To focus discussion, we
assume that migration and Z infections before or at birth in
City X are nonexistent/negligible.
The Figure shows a simplified causal diagram for the
target and study population depicting the relationships among
race, Z infection, and selection into the researcher’s study. Specifically, the variable S denotes whether an individual is alive
to be included in the researcher’s study and is influenced by race
given documented racial/ethnic differences in mortality.15,16
Furthermore, the variable U represents a common cause of S
and Z infection that was unmeasured in the study (e.g., neighborhood characteristics in childhood and adulthood17–19).
The investigator compares Z infection by racial group
(i.e., Black vs. White). Because the study population is a
selected sample of the target population comprised persons
who are alive to enroll, a box around S denoting conditioning
on the selected sample appears in the Figure. This conditioning means that the researcher’s racial comparison will yield
an estimate that may be subject to selection bias because S
is a collider.8,20 Thus, a racial difference in Z infection may
be observed in the study although race does not influence
Z infection in the target population. The potential for selection
bias for the effect of race on Z infection was confirmed via
simulations that are included in the Table.
Two approaches could be used to minimize the survival-related selection bias: (1) change the target population
or (2) change the study design. Regarding the first approach,
522 | www.epidem.com

to choose a target population that successfully minimizes
survival-related selection bias, the researcher should redefine the target population in ways that minimizes (1) the
possibility of exclusions because of death or (2) the extent
to which race or unmeasured determinants of the outcome
influence whether someone is a member of the study or target population.2 For example, the researcher could redefine
the target population to be Black and White City X residents
born in 1976. As confirmed by the simulations in the Table,
using a younger target population lowers the likelihood that
an eligible resident is excluded from the cross-sectional
study population because of dying before enrollment and
minimizes potential selection bias.
In contrast, if the target population were simply redefined to be the study population (i.e., Black and White City X
residents who were born in 1936 and are living at enrollment in
2016), being a member of the study and target population now
both require being alive when study enrollment occurs and
inclusion in the study and target population will be influenced
by race and U . Thus, an association between race and Z infection in the target and study population may occur even though
race does not influence Z infection. Therefore, selection bias
will not be minimized. If the researcher were to redefine the target population to be Black and White City X residents born in
1936 who would be alive at enrollment regardless of their race,
then in this target population race would not influence survival
to enrollment. An estimate obtained for this target population
would be equivalent to the survivor average causal effect21 and
not be subject to selection bias. However, even when the target
population is appropriately redefined, inferences based on this
first approach may pertain to fewer people.
A second approach to minimize selection bias would
be to change the study design so that the study population
includes a more representative and in turn less selected sample of the target population. For example, the researcher could
change the study design to a cohort study. Specifically, the
researcher could use (1) birth registry data to include all Black
and White City X residents born in 1936 in a cohort study population regardless of vital status in 2016 and (2) surveillance
data on Z infections to capture diagnoses of Z infection that
occur subsequent to birth by 2016 among cohort members.
However, changing the design may have limitations. For
instance, the use of surveillance data would miss infections
that occur among individuals who were never tested for the
Z virus. Missed infections would potentially result in measurement bias. Furthermore, a cohort design would likely require
analyzing the resulting data using a time-to-event framework
so that deaths that occur by 2016 and before Z infection are
appropriately handled.14 A time-to-event analysis would in
turn require estimating the time at which Z infection occurred,
which may be difficult using surveillance data, as well as
ascertaining death dates. However, as shown via simulations
in the Table, if the researcher accurately estimated times to
Z infection and death and applied a time-to-event framework

that included simply censoring follow-up at death and fitting

occurred before death were no longer excluded from the study.

DISCUSSION
Studies of racial health disparities may be subject to
selection bias because of the exclusion of persons who die
subsequent to conception or birth before the outcome of interest occurs or can be assessed in the study. Gauging the potential for this survival-related selection bias requires careful
consideration of the target population and study design. Like
in the Z infection example, careful consideration can include
using a causal diagram to reflect the target population and
study design and in turn identify potential sources of selection
bias. Such consideration can be implemented in the setting
of many commonly employed epidemiologic study designs
(e.g., cross-sectional, cohort, case–control) informed by prior
work.8,9,20,22 If the potential for selection bias exists, changing
the target population or study design may lessen the possibility of such selection bias. However, findings from the new
target population or study design may apply to fewer people
or may be more subject to other biases (e.g., measurement).
Therefore, the advantages of altering the target population
or study design should be weighed against the disadvantages.

If researchers deem that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages (e.g., selection bias expected to be less impactful than
measurement bias), they should at least explicitly acknowledge
the potential for survival-related selection bias when studying
racial health disparities. Part of this acknowledgment includes
articulating the expected magnitude and direction of such
selection bias when reporting results, if possible.2,23 Performing simulations as done here (see eAppendix; http://links.lww.
com/EDE/B351 for code) and previously23 can help predict the
magnitude and direction of bias and inform whether to change
the target population or study design.
