Durably reducing transphobia:
A field experiment on
door-to-door canvassing
David Broockman1* and Joshua Kalla2
Existing research depicts intergroup prejudices as deeply ingrained, requiring intense
intervention to lastingly reduce. Here, we show that a single approximately 10-minute
conversation encouraging actively taking the perspective of others can markedly
reduce prejudice for at least 3 months. We illustrate this potential with a door-to-door
canvassing intervention in South Florida targeting antitransgender prejudice. Despite
declines in homophobia, transphobia remains pervasive. For the intervention, 56
canvassers went door to door encouraging active perspective-taking with 501 voters
at voters’ doorsteps. A randomized trial found that these conversations substantially
reduced transphobia, with decreases greater than Americans’ average decrease
in homophobia from 1998 to 2012. These effects persisted for 3 months, and
both transgender and nontransgender canvassers were effective. The intervention
also increased support for a nondiscrimination law, even after exposing
voters to counterarguments.

ntergroup prejudice, defined broadly as negative attitudes about an outgroup, is a root
cause of numerous adverse social, political,
and health outcomes (1–3). Influential theories depict intergroup prejudices as deeply
ingrained during childhood and highly resistant
to change thereafter (4–6). Consistent with these
theories, empirical research has found that durably reducing prejudice is challenging. Mass
media interventions and other brief stimuli usually fail to reduce prejudiced attitudes (7) or have
only temporary effects (8); lasting change ap1

pears to require intense intervention over months
(9, 10). Rare are studies demonstrating prejudicereduction interventions relatively brief in duration yet proven to have lasting effects (4).
Theories of active processing, however, suggest
a method for even brief interventions to durably
change attitudes. A recurring finding of laboratory studies is that brief messages can durably
change individuals’ attitudes when individuals
engage in active, effortful, processing (known as
“System 2” processing) of those messages (11).
These studies, conducted on other topics, raise
the possibility that brief interventions encouraging active consideration of counter-prejudicial
thoughts could produce lasting changes in attitudes
toward an outgroup. Perspective-taking, “imagining
the world from another’s vantage point,” is one

based on scans acquired at rest, our model is
blind to different strategies that are chosen by the
participants in performing a given task. We refer
to these features as “inherent,” but we acknowledge
that these can be “structurally inherent” (related
to brain organization and connectivity) or “functionally inherent” (related to the cognitive state of
subjects during the resting-state scan).
The idea that brain connectivity can predict
activation has previously been reported for different modalities (22), where diffusion MRI tractography was used (23) to measure connectivity.
This study was limited to a specific cognitive task
and a predefined anatomical region. More recently, resting-state connectivity has been shown to be
predictive of subjects’ identity, in a way similar to
a fingerprint (24). Rather than simply identifying
subjects, our goal was to predict the entire layout
of brain activity for each subject. Moreover, we
also aim to predict such layout of activity in a
number of different cognitive domains, from a
single task-free scan, including in subjects that
show patterns of activation that are different
from the group average (perhaps most strikingly
in right-lateralized subjects when the majority of
training subjects are left-lateralized).
There are important practical implications of
the proposed framework in basic research and
translational neuroscience. It provides a method
for inferring multiple individualized functional
localizers based on a single resting-state scan.
Such a tool could be used to investigate in detail
the response profiles of localized brain regions
without the need to acquire often time-consuming
task localizers. Such a tool, if generalizable beyond the young, healthy population that makes
up the HCP database, could be used to investigate functional regions in subjects who cannot perform tasks, such as infants or paralyzed
patients.

assault young girls in women’s restrooms, a
strategy that observers believe contributed to
voters’ rejection of the city’s nondiscrimination
law (15).
Concerns that opponents of nondiscrimination laws would seek to exacerbate antitransgender prejudice in this manner motivated the
intervention we report, door-to-door canvassing
conversations in Miami, Florida. In December
2014, the Miami-Dade County Commission passed
an ordinance protecting transgender people from
discrimination in housing, employment, and public accommodations. Fearing a backlash that might
increase transphobia, volunteers and staff from
the Los Angeles LGBT Center (www.leadership-lab.
org) and SAVE (a South Florida LGBT organization; www.save.lgbt) went door to door to have
conversations with Miami-Dade voters.
For the intervention, canvassers first knocked
on voters’ doors unannounced. The one-time and
uninvited nature of this contact method represents a substantial departure from most prejudicereduction efforts previously studied, in which
students or employees volunteer to repeatedly interact with teachers or supervisors (4). Canvassers
asked to speak with the subject on their list and,
once this person’s identity was confirmed, identified themselves as volunteers from SAVE. The

canvassers then engaged in a series of strategies
previously shown to facilitate active processing
(11): Canvassers informed voters that they might
face a decision about the issue (whether to vote to
repeal the law protecting transgender people); canvassers asked voters to explain their views; and
canvassers showed a video that presented arguments
on both sides. Canvassers also defined the term
“transgender” at this point and, if they were transgender themselves, noted this. The canvassers next
attempted to encourage “analogic perspectivetaking” (16). Canvassers first asked each voter to
talk about a time when they themselves were
judged negatively for being different. The canvassers then encouraged voters to see how their
own experience offered a window into transgender people’s experiences, hoping to facilitate voters’
ability to take transgender people’s perspectives.
The intervention ended with another attempt to
encourage active processing by asking voters to
describe if and how the exercise changed their
mind. The conversations lasted around 10 min on
average. The supplementary materials provide
further details.
Like other field studies investigating the effects
of brief, psychologically informed interventions
(17, 18), studying the effects of this intervention
sheds light on the efficacy of theories of active

thought process theorized to be especially cognitively active that has been shown to reduce
prejudice in laboratory settings (12, 13). Together,
these theories suggest that an intervention imploring individuals to actively take an outgroup’s
perspective could durably reduce prejudice. Such
an intervention is reported here.
The intervention we report attempted to reduce prejudice toward transgender people, those
whose gender identity differs from the sex they
were assigned at birth. Prejudice against transgender people (transphobia) is extremely pervasive in the United States, but research on the
topic is limited and field studies are scarce (14).
However, transphobia is important for at least
two reasons. First, reducing transphobia is a recognized public health priority because it puts
transgender people at up to 25 times greater
risk of abuse, assault, and suicide (14). Attitudes
toward transgender people are also of growing
political importance. With tolerance toward lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people increasing,
opponents of laws protecting LGB and transgender
(LGBT) people from discrimination increasingly
promulgate antitransgender stereotypes to build
opposition to these laws. For example, a campaign
in Houston, Texas, in November 2015 portrayed
transgender women as “perverts” who sexually

processing and perspective-taking in a field setting.
However, this focus on external validity means
we cannot be certain that perspective-taking is
responsible for any effects or that active processing is responsible for their duration; being primarily concerned with external validity and seeking
to limit suspicion, we did not probe intervening
processes or restrict the scope of the conversations as a laboratory study would. Nevertheless,
as the supplementary materials describe, a majority of the training and conversations focused on

encouraging subjects to actively take transgender
people’s perspectives.
To measure the effects of these conversations,
we conducted a randomized placebo-controlled
experiment and parallel survey measurement.
First, we recruited registered voters (n = 68,378)
via mail for an ostensibly unrelated online baseline
survey, presented as the first in a series of surveys.
We next randomly assigned respondents to this
baseline survey (n = 1825) to either a treatment
group targeted with the intervention (n = 913) or

a placebo group targeted with a conversation
about recycling (n = 912) (19). Random assignment to treatment or placebo was conducted at
the household (n = 1295) level, such that subjects
within the same household always had the same
treatment assignment. Geographic clusters of respondents were also randomly assigned to have
these conversations with canvassers who identified themselves to canvass leaders as transgender
(n = 15) or as nontransgender (n = 41). The intervention then took place as described above;

“transgender” in the item wording revealed that placebo subjects were less supportive of protecting this group (P < 0.05, one-tailed). Next, all subjects were

the conversations’ effect endured (P < 0.05, one-tailed).

Figure 2A shows average support for the law,
which was measured on –3 to +3 Likert scales, by
condition and survey wave. Figure 2B shows the
estimated treatment effect by survey wave. As
Fig. 2 shows, there was no difference between
the treatment and placebo groups’ support for a
law protecting transgender people from discrimination in the 3-day and 3-week follow-up surveys.
As we registered in a preanalysis plan before
conducting the 6-week survey, we suspected that
many placebo group subjects did not know what
the term “transgender” meant (potentially being
more familiar with other, derogatory terms for
this group), making them unable to connect any
antitransgender attitudes with this question about
the law. However, the intervention informed treatment group subjects of the term’s definition, just as
all subjects might learn the term’s definition were a
political campaign ongoing. Likewise, views about
transgender people might not have been focal for
subjects when answering the question, whereas,
during recent political campaigns, the inclusion
of transgender people in nondiscrimination laws
has been strongly emphasized (15). We therefore
included a definition of the term “transgender”
in the survey questions about the law, starting
with the 6-week survey, clearly defining the term
and highlighting transgender people’s inclusion
in the law. As Fig. 2 shows, treatment subjects
were 0.36 scale points more supportive of the law
protecting this group than placebo subjects once
the survey question defined the term “transgender”
(t = 2.20; P < 0.05). This result is among the first
experimental demonstrations of political attitudes
exhibiting a long-lasting shift in response to persuasive communication (22).
One sign that attitude change is strong is that
it persists longitudinally, which we have shown;
another is that it withstands attack (11). Attack
ads featuring antitransgender stereotypes are
another common feature of political campaigns
waged in advance of public votes on nondiscrimination laws (15). To examine whether support
for the law would withstand such attacks, we
showed subjects one of three such ads from recent
political campaigns elsewhere, then immediately
asked about the law again. Unsurprisingly, both
groups were less supportive of the law immediately after viewing an attack ad. However, two
patterns qualify the ads’ effect. First, the intervention’s effect withstood this attack: The canvassing intervention treatment group remained
0.40 scale points more supportive of the law than
the placebo group (t = 1.77; P < 0.05, one-tailed).
This result stands in contrast to the general pattern that competing messages mute the effect
of political communication (23, 24) and suggests
that the intervention would remain effective in a
competitive political environment. Second, the
ad’s effect faded, whereas the canvassing intervention’s effect persisted. When we asked the same
question in the 3-month survey, both treatment
and placebo subjects returned to their pre-ad attitudes. That the effect of the attack ads appeared to
decay rapidly mirrors other research on political
television advertising (22, 25). However, by contrast, the treatment effect of the canvassing con-

versations appeared to persist, because subjects in
the canvassing treatment group remained 0.30
scale points more supportive than placebo subjects in the 3-month survey (t = 1.94; P < 0.05, onetailed). These results suggest that the canvassing
intervention’s effects were both lasting and politically relevant.
These findings have importance for a number
of theoretical and applied questions. First, in
light of influential theories that depict prejudiced attitudes as highly durable and resistant to
change (4–7), it is surprising that brief personal
interactions with strangers could markedly and
enduringly reduce prejudice in a field setting.
Rigorous field research has seldom documented
brief interventions capable of producing large
and lasting reductions in prejudice, leading the
present results to represent a rare challenge to
these theories.
The success of this approach was not obvious
beforehand. Field settings present many barriers
to perspective-taking, creating uncertainty about
perspective-taking’s potential outside the laboratory and making field tests a research priority
(12, 26). This setting presented further barriers
still. Transgender people are extremely stigmatized (14), which could have led individuals to
resist imagining transgender people’s perspective, especially when a transgender person was
present (13, 26). That uninvited strangers could
durably reduce prejudice when asking individuals to take transgender people’s perspective regardless of their own identity is thus particularly
auspicious for these theories. However, whether
active processing indeed moderates the persistence of perspective-taking’s effects is an open
question better suited to laboratory research, as
is whether “analogic” reflection on one’s own
personal experiences of stigma facilitates taking
the perspective of stigmatized groups.
On an applied level, the findings fill a void by
providing prejudice-reduction advocates a feasible and proven strategy. A now-retracted article
by LaCour and Green studying canvassing on
marriage equality by the same organization, the
Los Angeles LGBT Center, appeared in Science
last year (27, 28). This article “provided a template” for gay rights advocates worldwide before
its retraction (29). Several patterns in the present
study’s data renew confidence that advocates
could productively deploy the intervention strategy that we report. The intervention was effective among all prespecified subgroups, including
political parties. Canvassers did not require extensive experience. Both first-time and experienced
canvassers were effective, and most canvassers
continued volunteering after the study concluded,
indicating that organizations can develop activists
who will work to widely deploy the strategy (30).
With this said, whether these theoretical and
applied findings are limited in scope to negative
attitudes toward transgender people is an open
question that these findings cannot address;
even though transgender people are widely stigmatized (14), attitudes toward them may be less
entrenched than attitudes toward racial minorities, gays and lesbians, or other outgroups. The

self-identified transgender canvassers revealed
their identity to voters during these interactions.
Finally, we recruited individuals who came to their
doors in either condition (n = 501) to complete
follow-up online surveys via email presented as a
continuation of the baseline survey. These followup surveys began 3 days (n = 429), 3 weeks (n =
399), 6 weeks (n = 401), and 3 months (n = 385)
after the intervention. See fig. S1 for an overview.
Two survey design features warrant note. First,
although transgender rights have gained considerable media attention recently, many other derogatory terms are widely used to refer to this
group, and we feared that many subjects would
be unfamiliar with the term “transgender.” Therefore, survey item wordings generally eschewed
the term “transgender.” One exception is an item
about the law, presenting an issue that we will
return to later. Second, in order to conceal its
connection with the intervention, the survey was
presented as a broad university-sponsored public
opinion survey, and each wave included dozens
of unrelated items, with only a few concerning
transgender people. We carefully monitored responses for suspicion and found none.
The supplementary materials supply further
recruitment, design, and estimation details, tests
of design assumptions (tables S12 to S19), and
representativeness assessments (table S20).
First, results indicate that the intervention was
broadly successful at increasing acceptance of
transgender people, as measured by an index of
relevant items. Before the intervention, the treatment and placebo groups scored similarly on this
index (see tables S13 to S17). After the intervention, the treatment group was considerably more
accepting of transgender people than the placebo
group (t = 4.03; P < 0.001). These effects are
substantively large: These brief conversations
increased positivity toward transgender people,
as measured with a survey tool called a “feeling
thermometer” (20, 21), by ~10 points, an amount
larger than the average increase in positive affect
toward gay men and lesbians among Americans
between 1998 and 2012 (8.5 points) (see table
S22). Figure 1 shows the point estimates at each
wave and reveals that these effects persisted
longitudinally: The treatment group remained
more accepting in every follow-up survey (t tests;
all Ps < 0.01). (The point estimates are not strictly
comparable over time because respondents and
factor loadings change slightly; tables S1 to S4
show estimates for each item at each wave.) The
intervention was also broadly effective: The effects are significant at the P < 0.01 level for both
registered Democrats and registered Republicans
(see table S6) and for those who began more and
less supportive than average (t tests) (see table S8).
Finally, conversations with transgender and
nontransgender canvassers were both effective
(t tests) (see table S5).
Second, these increases in acceptance of transgender people had ramifications for political attitudes: Treatment subjects were more supportive
of the law protecting transgender people from
discrimination than placebo subjects once the
term “transgender” was defined for all subjects.

R ES E A RC H | R E PO R TS

experiment thus invites replication with other
outgroups.
The intervention’s durable effect on support
for a nondiscrimination law also suggests optimism for the public sphere. Over the past century, political campaigns have increasingly relied
on mass communication to reach voters (31). However, facing difficulty persuading a polarizing
public with these strategies (22), campaigns increasingly eschew making the case for their positions and instead focus on rousing enthusiasm of
voters who already agree with them (32). These
shifts undermine basic aspirations for democratic
discourse. However, these findings suggest that it
may be in campaigns’ own best interest to place
renewed emphasis on a personal exchange of initially opposing views, even regarding controversial issues and across partisan lines.

Observational constraints on
mixed-phase clouds imply higher
climate sensitivity
Ivy Tan,1* Trude Storelvmo,1 Mark D. Zelinka2
Global climate model (GCM) estimates of the equilibrium global mean surface temperature
response to a doubling of atmospheric CO2, measured by the equilibrium climate sensitivity
(ECS), range from 2.0° to 4.6°C. Clouds are among the leading causes of this uncertainty.
Here we show that the ECS can be up to 1.3°C higher in simulations where mixed-phase clouds
consisting of ice crystals and supercooled liquid droplets are constrained by global satellite
observations.The higher ECS estimates are directly linked to a weakened cloud-phase feedback
arising from a decreased cloud glaciation rate in a warmer climate. We point out the need for
realistic representations of the supercooled liquid fraction in mixed-phase clouds in GCMs,
given the sensitivity of the ECS to the cloud-phase feedback.

M

ixed-phase clouds, ubiquitous in Earth’s
atmosphere (1) at temperatures between
0° and –40°C, strongly influence Earth’s
radiation budget (2–4). For a fixed amount
of cloud water, spherical liquid droplets
tend to be smaller in size (5) and also to outnumber ice crystals, because ice nuclei (IN) are
relatively scarce in Earth’s atmosphere in comparison to cloud condensation nuclei (6). As a
consequence, clouds that consist of a higher fraction of liquid are optically thicker and hence
more reflective of sunlight. Here we refer to the
fraction of supercooled liquid within a mixedphase cloud at a particular isotherm as the supercooled liquid fraction (SLF).
It has recently been shown that SLFs are severely underestimated on a global scale in a multitude of global climate models (GCMs) (7, 8).
This arises from two main causes. The first cause
concerns the challenge of representing the microscopic nature of the various mixed-phase cloud

processes (9) that cannot be resolved at the typical
spatial scales of GCMs. The Wegener-BergeronFindeisen (WBF) process for ice crystal growth is
one such process that critically affects SLFs
(8, 10–12). This process refers to the growth of ice
crystals at the expense of surrounding supercooled liquid droplets in a mixed-phase cloud as
a consequence of the lower saturation vapor
pressure over ice relative to liquid. An ambient
vapor pressure in between the saturation vapor
pressures over liquid and ice is both a necessary
and sufficient condition for the WBF process to
occur in mixed-phase clouds (5). GCMs typically
parameterize the WBF process by assuming
homogeneous mixtures of supercooled liquid
droplets and ice crystals within a model gridbox
(10, 11). However, in situ observations suggest
that such mixtures rarely exist in nature. Instead,
pockets composed purely of either supercooled
liquid droplets or ice crystals that are orders of
magnitude smaller than the volume of a typical
GCM gridbox are suggested to be the norm (13, 14).
This implies that the WBF process may be too
efficient in GCMs and is thus potentially a culprit
for the underestimation of SLFs in GCMs. The multiple modes of ice nucleation (5), further complicated
by the uncertainty associated with the efficiency

Not just turnout, but turnaround matters
In the last several U.S. presidential elections, the campaign mantra has focused on making sure that voters
already aligned with one's candidate do get out to vote. There is a long history of unsuccessful efforts to change people's
attitudes. Nevertheless, Broockman and Kalla conducted a field experiment showing that Miami voters shifted their
attitudes toward transgender individuals and maintained those changed positions for 3 months (see the Perspective by
Paluck).
