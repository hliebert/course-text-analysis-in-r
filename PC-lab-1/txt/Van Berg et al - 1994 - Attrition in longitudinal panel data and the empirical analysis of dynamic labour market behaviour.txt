SUMMARY
In the empirical analysis of unemployment durations and job durations, it is generally assumed that the

stochasticprocessesunderlyinglabourmarketbehaviourand the behaviourconcerningparticipationin
a panel surveyare independent.However,thereare reasonsto believethat the probabilityof dropping
out of the panel is relatedto the rate at whicha (different)job is found. If thereis such a relation,and
if it is ignored, then the estimator of the rate at which individuals become employed or change jobs will

generallybe inconsistent.In this paperwe analysethe relationbetweenthe durationspent in a particular
labourmarketstateand the durationof panelsurveyparticipation,by explicitlymodellingand estimating
the joint distribution of both durations. The emphasis will be on models allowing for stochastically
related unobserved determinants of both types of duration. We estimate models both for unemployment

durationsand for job durations.

1. INTRODUCTION
In the empirical analysis of individual unemployment durations and job durations, it is
generally assumed that the stochastic processes underlying labour market behaviour and the
behaviour concerning participation in a panel survey are independent. If this assumption is
correct, then attrition from the panel before the duration is completed can be considered as
independent right-censoring of the duration variable. Nevertheless, it seems plausible that
panel survey participants who have a relatively high probability of finding a (different) job also
have a higher probability of dropping out of the panel (e.g. individuals may move to another
town to work in a new job, and the agency running the survey may have trouble following
them). If that is true then the commonly used procedure to estimate models for the duration
spent in a particular state of the labour market (say, unemployment) underestimates the rate
at which individuals become employed or change jobs.
In Lillard (1989), a Weibull proportional hazard model for the duration of participation in
the PSID panel survey is estimated. It appears that the exit rate out of the panel is significantly
larger for individuals who expect to move in the near future. Although the model in Lillard

(1989) is simple and not comparable to the models proposed in the present paper, this result
supports the suspicion that the commonly used procedure to estimate duration models may
produce biased results.
In this paper we will examine whether there is a relation between the duration spent in a
labour market state and the duration of panel survey participation. In particular, we will
estimate models for the joint distribution of these two duration variables. This means that we
have to explicitly model the distribution of survey participation duration and its relation to the
distribution of the duration spent in a particular state of the labour market. In accordance to
the literature on duration analysis, we take a hazard rate approach when specifying the model.
The hazard rate of the distribution of survey participation duration (or, equivalently, the exit
rate out of the panel) can be interpreted as the rate at which contact between participating
individuals and interviewers is lost. The duration of survey participation is treated as an
absolutely continuous random variable. Of course, its realizations can only be observed to lie
between two consecutive waves of the panel.
There are several ways to model dependence of the duration spent in a particular labour
market state and the duration of survey participation. Here, the emphasis will be on models
allowing for such dependence by way of stochastically related unobserved determinants of
both types of duration. An advantage of such models is that they do not a priori restrict the
sign of the dependence if a sufficiently flexible class of distributions is chosen for the
unobserved determinants. Thus, such models can mimic other types of dependence between
both durations.
The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we present the model. We derive the
likelihood function taking into account that we have samples from the stocks of individuals
in the labour market states of interest. We also examine in some detail the parameterization
of the distribution of the unobserved heterogeneity terms. In Section 3 the results are
presented. We check in a number of ways whether the results are sensitive with respect to the
model specification.
Modelling the relationship between labour market duration variables and attrition by way
of their unobserved determinants is in line with the popular modelling set-up for sample
selection introduced by Heckman (1979). In our application there could be a more direct
relationship. It is conceivable that a positive fraction of the individuals who decide to start
working in a new job immediately leave the panel. In Section 4 we investigate this by
constructing and estimating an alternative model. We find the phenomenon to be empirically
unimportant. Section 5 concludes.
2. THE JOINT DISTRIBUTION OF SPELL LENGTH AND OBSERVATION PERIOD
The Model
We are interested in estimating the distribution of the sojourn time t in a particular labour
market state. If we follow a cohort of heterogeneous individuals, we can estimate the hazard
rate of leaving the state, and relate this rate to observed and unobserved characteristics of the
individuals. The observed characteristics are given by a vector of regressors x, and the
unobserved characteristics are summarized by a scalar random variable v, with x and v
independent. We assume that the hazard rate is of the Mixed Proportional Hazard (MPH)
type,
O(t I v,x) = at"-.v.exp(xfl31)

Note that in equation (1) all explanatory variables are time-invariant and that the baseline
hazard has a Weibull specification. The latter assumptions, which are adopted in the empirical
analysis below as well as all other main assumptions, will be listed together at the end of this
subsection.
Because v is unobserved, empirical inference is based on the distribution with c.d.f. G(t Ix).
The hazard rate associated with G(t Ix) is
E v
6(t x)= atat-l.E(v

t,x).exp(x{l1)

(2)

with E(v\ I>t,x) denoting the mean of v among the survivors at t, i.e. conditional on the
sojourn time exceeding t.
In practice we do not follow all individuals until after they have left the state of interest.
As a consequence, some durations are censored. The length of the observation period may be
determined in advance, even before the observation starts (Type I censoring), or it may be due
to panel attrition. In any case, in most empirical applications it is assumed that this censoring
can be treated as independent right-censoring. For this assumption to be valid, the observation
process should not be selective, i.e. the observed hazard rate at t should not differ from the
hazard rate specified in equation (2). In other words, the information that an individual is
under observation just before t should not change our prediction of him leaving the state at
t. Type I censoring satisfies this requirement. (See Aalen, 1978, Williams and Lagakos, 1977,
and Lagakos, 1979, for some general theory.)
Let a be the length of the period that a randomly chosen individual participates in the panel.
This length is itself a duration. We can model it in the same way as t. The random variable
u summarizes the unobserved heterogeneity in the distribution of a. The hazard of a
conditional on x and u is denoted by (a Iu, x) and is assumed to be of the MPH type,

I(aI u,x) = a6-l.u.exp(xi2)

(3)

Problems arise if a is related to the unobserved v. In that case, knowledge that a > t is
informative on v. Hence, it will alter E(v I > t, x), and thus the hazard rate of t given x. For
example, if the distribution of v given a > t stochastically dominates the population
distribution of v, and if this is ignored, then we obtain an overestimate of the conditional
hazard 0(tI v,x).
We assume that t Ix and a Ix are related by way of their unobserved determinants being
related. In other words, t Ix and a Ix are independent if and only if u and v are independent.
If u and v are independent then we have an ordinary single-spell duration model for t in which
a is the (independent right) censoring point. However, if u and v are dependent, then a is
related to v, and inference on the distribution of t has to be based on the joint distribution
of t, a x.
Basically, we observe t iff t < a, and a iff a < t. Consequently, our model is a competing
risks model in which we observe min(t, a), I(t < a), and x, where I(E) is the indicator
function of the event E. Recall that we have adopted MPH specifications for the hazards of

t v,x and a u,x. In such models, the joint distributionof u,v can be identified from

observations on min(t, a), I(t < a) and x, under general conditions (see Heckman and
Honore, 1989). The nonparametric identifiability of the joint distribution of u, v (and the
baseline hazards) implies that we need not rely on arbitrary parametric or distributional
assumptions. However, since the data sets we use are quite small, and since the nonparametric
estimation theory of such models has not yet been well established, the application will be
parametric.The parametersare et, f3\, 2, 6 (see equations(1) and (3)) as well as the parameters
of the joint distribution of u, v.

Below we summarize the assumptions we make. The last two assumptions will be discussed
in the next subsections. Those two assumptions, as well as the assumption that we have
Weibull baseline hazards, are not necessary for the type of empirical analysis carried out below
(see Van den Berg et al., 1991, for a more general set-up). Rather, they are adopted because
of computational and data limitations in our particular application, as will become clear in the
sequel.
Assumption 1. The hazards 0(t Iv,x) and (a u,x) are of the MPH type. The baseline
hazards have Weibull specifications. There are no time-varying explanatory variables. (See
equations (1) and (3).)
Assumption 2. t x and a x are dependent iff u and v are dependent.
Assumption 3. The inflow rate into the labour market state of interest is constant before the
first interview and factorizes in v and x.
Assumption 4. The distribution of u, v is bivariate discrete with fixed numbers of points of
support which have unknown locations and probability masses.
Distribution of the Endogenous Variables in a Stock Sample
In this subsection, the actual likelihood function is derived for the model, given the particular
observation scheme (or sample set-up) we use in the empirical analysis. To be able to do so,

we first have to considerthe joint distributionof the endogenousvariablesin such samples.
Our data on the duration spent in a particular state S of the labour market are based on
a sample from the stock of individuals in that state, namely those who are participating in the
first wave of the panel. As is well known, such samples are selective samples from the relevant
population (see e.g. Ridder, 1984). There are two reasons for this. First, the probability that
a particular spell is included is proportional to its length (length-biased sampling). Second, this
probability depends on the rate at which spells start during the period preceding the sampling
date (infow rate dependence). We assume that the inflow rate at a given date, given v and x,
does not depend on a or u. This makes sense since the inflow rate is a result of labour market
behaviour. As may be clear intuitively, the selectivity induced by drawing from the stock does
not affect the distributions of a I u, x and u in the sample. Because of this, the standard results
on stock samples in Ridder (1984) and Chesher and Lancaster (1983) can be straightforwardly
extended to deal with the selectivity in the present context.
Let the duration variable r denote the time spent in state S between the moment at which
the stock sample is drawn (which is the moment of the first interview) and the moment at which
exit out of state S occurs. Subsequent waves (interviews) of the panel survey provide
information on r. The first wave also gives information on the elapsed duration p in state S
at the moment at which the stock sample is drawn. Let a subscript s of a density or probability
denote the conditioning on presence in the stock of individuals in S. Let h be a generic symbol
for a density. The argument of the density will make clear which variable is considered.
However, we denote the density defined by the hazard 0(t Iv,x) by f(t Iv,x) and the
corresponding c.d.f. by F(t I v, x). The likelihood function is based on the density hs(p, r, a Ix)
of the endogenous variables conditional on x and presence in the stock.
Using the literature mentioned above, it can be shown that hs(p, r, a x) can be expressed
as follows,
hs(p, r, a Ix)=

f(p + r vj, x)

.hs(a I ui, x) .Prs(u = ui, v = vj)

F(p vj,x) dp

in which (1) hs(a Iu, x) is the density defined by the hazard (a Iu, x), (2) the distribution of
u, v in the stock is such that u and v in the stock are independent if and only if they are
independent in the population, and (3) u, v in the stock are independent of x (see Van den Berg
et al., 1991, for details and proofs). Note that the inflow rate does not enter the expression
above. In equation (4), hs(p, r, a x) follows from integrating hs(p, r v, x).hs(a Iu, x) w.r.t.
the distribution of u, v in the stock. Therefore in practice one can choose a parameterization
for the distribution of u and v in the stock, and estimate the parameters of this distribution
along with the parameters of 0(t I v, x) and (a I u, x). In fact, this is the standard procedure
for estimating reduced-form duration models using stock samples in the presence of
unobserved heterogeneity.
It should be noted that if the model is parameterized in a different way, or if we condition
the likelihood on the realizations of p, then we do not need Assumptions 3 and 4 to get an
estimable model (details are in Van den Berg et al., 1991). This implies that by estimating the
model in a number of different ways, it may be checked whether these conditions are satisfied.

Note, however, that even with a Weibull baseline hazard in 0(t v,x) the estimation is
computationally demanding, since then the likelihood contribution contains a nonanalytical
integral if both p and r are censored from above. Also note that the data on p provide
information that is additional to the minimum amount of information needed for
identification.
Construction of the likelihood function
Let the panel survey consist of j waves. Individuals who participate in the first wave are
invited to participate in all subsequent waves. However, there is no return to the panel. The
variable r may be censored either because the individual is still in state S at the date of the jth
interview or because the individual drops out of the panel before that date.
Consequently, we can distinguish between three different cases. Let ri (i = 1, ..., j) denote
the length of the time period between the ith and the first interview (so T1 = 0). Case I is defined
as the case in which r is observed exactly. Suppose ri c r < ri + (i E 1, ...,j - 1). Then, if p
is uncensored, the likelihood contribution ? of the individual equals
=

If p is censored (i.e. if it is only known that p exceeds a certain value) then the r.h.s. of
equation (5) has to be integrated over p accordingly.
Case II is the case in which we observe that the individual drops out of the panel before the
date of the jth interview and the individual was still in state S at the last wave at which he
or she participated. Suppose the individual drops out of the panel between the ith and the

The Parameterization of the Distribution of Unobserved Heterogeneity
In this subsection we discuss the parameterization of the joint distribution of u, v (see
Assumption 4).
In the literature on unemployment durations, unobserved heterogeneity is often modelled by
way of a discrete random variable (see e.g. Nickell, 1979; Ham and Rea, 1987). Usually, if
more than two or three points of support are taken then the estimates of some of them
coincide. Heckman and Singer (1984) show that in a class of mixed proportional hazard
duration models the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator of the heterogeneity
distribution is a discrete distribution. However, the estimation procedure requires the number
of points of support not to be fixed in advance, and estimation of standard errors is not
straightforward. Moreover, the procedure is developed for situations in which censoring is
independent. Nevertheless, this result illustrates the flexibility of discrete distributions in terms
of the range of observed mixture duration distributions they can generate.
There is a large applied literature in which two duration variables are allowed to depend on
each other by way of their unobserved explanatory variables u and v (see e.g. Devine and
Kiefer, 1990, for examples in which the duration variables denote durations spent in different
labour market states). In most papers u and v are specified as u = exp(co.w) and v =
exp(cl.=),
in which w is a univariate random variable and co and ci are parameters to be estimated. This
restricts the way u and v are related. Lindeboom and Van den Berg (1994) show that in such
models there may be insufficient flexibility to correctly estimate the dispersion as well as the
relation of the duration variables. A genuine bivariate specification of the distribution of u, v
seems preferable.
Butler et al. (1989) estimate a model for retired individuals in which unobserved explanatory
variables for the duration until return to work and the duration of life are allowed to be
correlated. They assume that the heterogeneity terms follow a discrete bivariate distribution,
as in the present paper. However, in the estimation procedure, the points of support for u and
v are fixed in advance, whereas we will estimate these points along with the other parameters.
Van den Berg (1995) examines the range of values that the correlation of the duration
variables can attain in bivariate MPH models, in general as well as for particular parametric
families of the distribution of u, v. It turns out that when u and v have a bivariate discrete
distribution with two or more points of support for each, and the locations of these points are
not fixed in advance, then all possible values can be attained. On the other hand, when log
u and log v have a bivariate normal distribution, or when they have a bivariate discrete
distribution in which the locations of the points of support are fixed in advance, then the range
of values that can be attained is smaller.
These results are taken to justify Assumption 4. In most of the empirical analysis below, we
assume that u and v both have two points of support (ul, u2, Vi andv2). We will show that

in that case it is relativelyeasy to interpretthe estimationresultsand to test for independence.
We take ul > U2 > 0 and vl> V2> 0. The probabilitiesPrs(u = ui, v =Vj) are denoted as
follows:
pi = Pr(u = ui, v = vl)

p3 = Prs(u = ul, v = V2)

P2 = Prs(u = U2, V = Vi)

p4= Pr(u = U2, V = V2)= 1 - -p2

The covariance of u and v in the stock can be written as
cov(u,

v) = (P1P4 - P2P3)

(8)

The support of the distribution of u, v in the stock equals the support in the population, but

427

the probabilities associated with the points of support in the stock do not equal those in the
population. However, it can be shown that the sign of the covariance of u and v in the stock
equals the sign of it in the population. Further, u and v are independent if and only if
cov(u, v) = 0 (for details, see Van den Berg et al., 1991).
Since r Ix and a Ix are independent if and only if u and v are independent, it follows that
r | x and a Ix are independent if and only if P1P4 = P2P3 (conditional on ul uz and v\i v2).
This makes it easy to test for independence between the duration in state S and the duration
of participation in the panel survey. Moreover, there holds that cov(r, a i x), cov(u, v), and the
covariance cov(t, a jx) of t Ix and a jx in the population, always have the same sign (which,
if u\l U2 and Vi V2, is the sign of P1P4 - P2P3)
In Section 3 we report estimates for three different model specifications. Model 3 is the
general model. Model 1 is the model without unobserved heterogeneity, i.e. the model in which
it is imposed that ui = u2 and vi = v2. In Model 2 we allow for unobserved heterogeneity in
0 and Â¢, but we impose that u and v are independent, i.e. we impose that P1P4 - P2P3 = 0 if
ui
u2 and vl v2. By comparing the results for Models 1 and 2 it can be tested whether there
is unobserved heterogeneity in the exit rates 0 and P. Note, however, that such a comparison

is conditionalon independenceof u and v. By comparingthe resultsfor Models2 and 3 it can
be tested whether the unobserved heterogeneity terms u and v are dependent.
Because in Models 1 and 2 the likelihood factorizes in a part associated with unemployment
durations and a part associated with the durations of survey participation, the test statistics
for unobserved heterogeneity in 0 and r are independent. The LR tests for Ho: v, = V2and for
Ho: ul = U2are nonstandard, because under the null hypothesis fewer parameters are identified
than under the alternative. n the literature it is usually assumed that a test in which critical
values of the X2 distribution are used is on the safe side.
Conditional on ui
u2 and vI
V2,testing for independence of u and v (or, equivalently,
for cov(u, v) = 0) in Model 3 means testing for P1P4 - P2P3 = 0. Consequently, conditional on
ui
U2 and v, v2 and on 0 < pi < 1 for all i, the LR test for independence asymptotically
has a x2 distribution under the null hypothesis.
We do not include constant terms in xi and x2 (see equations (1) and (3)), since these would
be undistinguishable from multiplicative constants in v and u, respectively. However, in Model
1 every individual has the same realization of v and u, and these will be represented by constant
terms in xi and x2, respectively (though they could as well be represented by v, and ul in a
model in which it is imposed that P1 = 1).
3. THE DATA AND THE RESULTS
Unemployment Duration and Attrition
For the empirical analysis of the relation between the duration of unemployment or a job and
the duration of survey participation, we use two data sets. In the present subsection we use
data on unemployment durations from a panel survey conducted by the Netherlands Central
Bureau of Statistics (CBS). In the next subsection we use data on job durations from a panel
survey held by the Organization of Strategic Labour Market Research (OSA).
The data
As of April 1984, the Netherlands Central Bureau of Statistics conducts the Netherlands
Social-Economic Panel survey. Interviews are held twice a year. At every interview,
respondents were asked to recall their labour market history for the past 6 months. At the first

interview the observation period is extended to 12 months. We use the first four waves of the
panel.
For our purposes we selected 223 men aged between 17 and 65, who reported that at the
moment of the first interview (April 1984) their main activity was being unemployed and
searching for work. Of the data on p, 64% is censored in the sense that it is only known that
p exceeds a year. Further, Case I (see above for the definition) holds for 50% of the
individuals, while Cases II and III hold for 28% and 22% of the individuals, respectively.
Between the first and the second wave, 40 of the 223 individuals (18qo) drop out of the panel.
From the individuals in our sample who are unemployed at the date of the second (third)
interview and who participate in that interview, 11% (14%) drop out of the panel before the
third (fourth) interview.
In the present context, Assumption 3 in Section 2 states that the inflow rate into
unemployment is constant before April 1984. One may question whether this assumption holds
true. In the UK the inflow rate was fairly constant between 1967 and 1983 apart from an
increase in 1979-81 (see Pissarides, 1986). Reliable Dutch data are absent. However, in Van
den Berg (1990) the sensitivity of unemployment duration models to changes in the time path
of the inflow rate is checked using the same data set as in the present paper. It appears that
the main results are insensitive to a priori reasonable changes. Finally, recall from the above
that we can test for the inflow rate assumption.
Concerning the parameterization of the model, we take 6 = 1 in equation (3). Clearly, this
is restrictive. The reason for assuming a constant exit rate here is that we do not have much
information on the distribution of a Iu,x: the sample is quite small and the data on a are
grouped (we, at most, observe that a lies between two interviews).
Because we are dealing with a relatively small sample, we restrict ourselves to a small number
of explanatory variables. It should be noted that the inclusion of additional variables in xl or
X2

(see equations (1) and (3)) did not alter the conclusions with respect to the sign and

magnitude of the relationship between unemployment duration and the duration of panel
survey participation.
The estimation method we have employed was ML using the BHHH algorithm. If an
individual in the sample is in Case II or Case III and if p is censored for that individual, then
the likelihood contribution contains an incomplete Gamma function. This function is
calculated numerically using Gauss-Laguerre quadrature.
Results
Table I contains the parameter estimates. The unit time period is one week. For all three
models, the estimates of f1 and f2 seem to be in accordance with intuition. Since here our
primary interest is in the estimates of hs(u, v), we will not give a lengthy account of the results
in parts (1) and (2) of Table I. Note that the magnitude of the parameter in f2 associated with
the constant term in x2 (or, in Models 2 and 3, the mean of u), among other things reflects
the efforts by the agency running the Survey to follow respondents. Thus, this value probably
depends very much on the survey set-up.
Clearly, the negative duration dependence of 0 in Model 1 has its counterpart in the
unobserved heterogeneity in 0 in Model 2. Note that in Model 2, the pi are just the products
of the probabilities of the associated realizations of u and v (e.g. pi = Ps(u = ul) Ps(v = Vi)).
There are two cross-parameterrestrictionson pi, P2,p3, and p4 in Model 2, a linear one
(Pi + P2 + P3 +p4 = 1), and a nonlinear one (P1P4 - P2P3 = 0). By using the likelihood values
reported in part (5) of Table I we can test whether Model 2 is a significant improvement over
Model 1. It follows that vl = V2 is strongly rejected and that ul = U2 is weakly rejected.

Now let us compare the results for Model 2 with those for Model 3. The estimates of what
normally are the parameters of interest (01 and oe) are virtually identical in both models.
Moreover,this also holds for the estimatesof 02, U1, U2, v1, and v2. The estimatesof pi, P2,
p3, and p4 in Model 3 differ only slightly from those in Model 2. As a result, there is a small
negative correlation between u and v. From Table I, corr(u, v) = 0 cannot be rejected. It
follows that it cannot be rejected that r and a are independent (conditional on x).
If we integrate p out of the likelihood, or use the likelihood conditional on p to estimate
the model, then this does not affect the results in any substantial way. This may be regarded

as evidencethat the constantinflow rate assumptionis not violated, or, at least, that it is not
a strong assumption.
When data on p and xl are available, then, in principle, these are sufficient to consistently
estimate the parameters of the unemployment duration distribution. It might therefore be
interesting to proceed along this way and compare the results to those in parts (1), (3) and (4)

of Table I. Unfortunately,it appearedthat the informationin the data on p is insufficientto
disentangle the estimate of ac from the estimates of vl and

in 0i (when vI =

A striking feature of the estimated hs(u, v) is that individuals who have ul as a realization
of u (7 601oof the stock of unemployed at the moment of the first interview) have a very high
estimated exit rate out of the panel. For example, if such an individual has lower secondary
education (education = 2) and the Dutch nationality, then the estimated exit rate out of the
panel uo (x) equals 0 37, which implies that the expected duration of survey participation is
as small as 2 weeks and 5 days. Moreover, the probability of exit out of the panel before the
second interview (that is, before about 26 weeks) is as high as 0-9999. As a result, the model
predicts that at the date of the second interview the remaining participants are virtually
homogeneous with respect to u. If in reality the latter does not hold then our conclusions may
be invalid. To investigate this, we estimated an extended model. In particular, we allowed u, v
to have six points of support based on three possible realizations of u and two of v. It turned
out that the results confirm the conclusions above (see Van den Berg et al., 1991 for details).
Job Duration and Attrition
In this subsection we briefly report the results of applying the methods of this paper to panel
survey data on job durations. Because these data have been discussed and analysed extensively
in Lindeboom and Theeuwes (1991) and Van den Berg (1992), the present exposition can be
very brief. (Lindeboom and Theeuwes, 1991, assume independent right-censoring; Van den
Berg, 1992, uses only the first spell of the survey.)
The data
The data are from three waves of a Dutch panel survey of individuals, conducted in April
1985, October 1986, and October 1988. From the first wave we selected 1726 respondents who
were working in full-time jobs at the date of interview. From these respondents, 1210
participated in the second wave and only 835 participated in the third wave. Case I (see above
for the definition) holds for 24% of the individuals, Case II for 50%o,and Case III for 26%.
We assume absence of duration dependence in the job-duration hazard O(t I v, x) (so a = 1

in equation (1)). As noted in Section 2, this assumptionis convenientbecause it precludes
numerical integration in the likelihood. Previous studies such as Van den Berg (1992) and
Lindeboom and Theeuwes (1991) found that this is a valid assumption for the Netherlands.
There is no prior information on duration dependence of the exit rate out of the panel. Since
the sample size is rather large, we try to allow for duration dependence of the exit rate out
of the panel (see equation (3)).
Results
The results for the three estimated model versions are in Table II by comparing Models 1
and 2 we see that allowing for unobserved heterogeneity does not have large or significant
effects. The estimates of vl and v2 converged to the same value and hence the associated
probabilities are not identified. As a result, the estimates for the parameters in 0 in Model 2
are equal to those in Model 1. For the survey participation duration slight changes in the
estimates are found in comparison to those for Model 1.
Now let us compare the results of Models 2 and 3. Model 3 shows large changes in
comparison to the results of Model 2. The likelihood value changes considerable, and there
are major shifts in the parameter estimates for t. The variables on age, gender, education, and
other characteristics (breadwinner, nationality, and region) have more pronounced effects. The
estimate of the duration dependence parameter 6 rises to 1 04, and is insignificantly different
from one. There are also some large changes in the parameter estimates for hs(u, v).

The parameter estimates for the exit rate out of a job 0 hardly change (although the precision
improves). This may be due to the fact that the data contain, on average, many uncensored
and relatively long-elapsed durations p. It may be that the information on 0 that is contained
in the data on p dominates other sources of information on 0.
The estimates on the heterogeneity distribution hs(u, v) suggest that for 10% of the sample
relatively long job durations are combined with relatively short survey participation durations,
whereas the reverse holds for the other 90% of the sample. Indeed, the estimates of corr(u, v)
and corr(r, a x) are negative, although insignificantly different from zero according to the
Wald test. The LR test, on the other hand, rejects the hypothesis that corr(u, v) = 0, so there
is some ambiguity. However, since the estimates of what normally are the parameters of
interest (13i) are virtually identical in Models 1 and 3, it does not matter in practice whether
account is taken of the dependence of r Ix and a Ix or not.
Another test confirms our findings. We estimated i1 using only data on p, in a model
without unobserved heterogeneity but with a dummy in xi for respondents who leave the
survey before the second wave. The results of this simple test again indicate a negative
association (a significant coefficient was found). Leaving out the dummy variable, however,
hardly changes the estimates of the remaining parameters in 31.

4. AN ALTERNATIVE MODEL
As noted in the Introduction, one possible reason for a relation between the duration t spent
in a state S (unemployment or being in a job) and the duration of panel survey participation
a is that individuals may drop out of the panel because they found a (different) job. If
individuals move to other addresses because of new jobs it may be hard for the agency
conducting the survey to follow them. The kind of relation between t and a in such cases is
different from that modelled in Section 2. For example, there is a positive probability that t
and a are virtually equal, and there is a relation between t Ix and a Ix even if there are no
unobserved explanatory variables. In this section we construct and estimate a model in line
with the above argument.
For reasons of simplicity, we will for the moment abstract from unobserved explanatory
variables v, and assume that equation (1) holds with a= 1. As a result, p x and r x are
independent, and both have an exponential density with hazard exp(xlftf). We now define the
stochastic process characterizing attrition conditional on the stochastic process characterizing
the labour market behaviour. To be particular, we assume that exit out of the panel occurs
at the rate exp(x2,B2) from the first interview onward. However, if, at the moment that the
individual leaves state S the individual still participates in the survey, then there is a probability
r E [0, 1] that exit from the panel occurs at that very moment. Therefore, if it is only known
that a > r, then, for given r, the probability that a = r equals ir. The variables r and a are
independent if and only if vr= 0. It is clear that if, in this context, we would treat attrition as
independent right-censoring of r, then the mean estimate of o(x) would be underestimated if
ir > 0. Note that we may allow for ir to depend on x. (It may be interesting to note that for
r = 0 we get a model that is observationally equivalent to a so-called constant-product model
proposed by Lagakos and Williams, 1978.)
The conditional density hs(a \ r, x) can be written as
hs(a Ir,x) = Do(x).e -o(X) a.I[o,r>(a) + (1 - 7).ro(x).e'
eo(x).r
Ps(a = r r, x) = r.e

Io(x) a.I<r,oo>(a)

Clearly, it is not absolutely continuous. The density hs(r, a | x) follows from multiplication of
equation (9) by the exponential density hs(r x). From this it can be inferred that
Ps(r = a | x) = (o80(x)/(Oo(x)+ Â¢o(x))).1r, so the probability that r and a occur simultaneously
equals the probability that a does not occur before r times the probability that a occurs when
r occurs. From hs(r, a | x) it also follows that
hs(a Ix) = (1 - ir). ro(x).e - o(x).a+ 7r.(Oo(x)+ ro(x)).e - (^(x)+ro(x)).a

(10)

which is a discrete mixture of two exponential densities. This implies that hs(a Ix) displays
negative duration dependence.
There holds that
cov(r, a lx) =

(Oo(X) + 3'o(x))2

(11)

so a negative relation between r and a is ruled out. Clearly, this means that the model is quite
restrictive.
By multiplying hs(r, a jx) with the exponential density hs(p Ix) we obtain hs(p, r, a jx). The
likelihood can be constructed from hs(p, r, a x) along the lines described above. The
parameters to be estimated are 7r, 13, and 32. Estimation of the model on the unemployment
duration data from Section 3 resulted in an estimate of ir of 0-012 with standard error 0*14,
so 7ris insignificantly different from zero. Estimation of the model on the job duration data
from Section 3 forced the parameter Xrto the boundary (7r= 0) of the parameter space. This
reconfirms the conclusions stated in Section 3. In the light of these results, and in the light of
the restrictiveness of the model used here, we did not pursue more extensive analyses with this
model.
5. CONCLUSION
In this paper we have analysed the relation between individual labour market behaviour over
time and the duration of participation in panel surveys. We used models which allow for
dependence by way of stochastically related unobserved determinants of the duration of survey
participation and the duration of being unemployed or the duration of being in a job.
We paid attention to the complications arising when the sample is from the stock of
individuals in the labour market state of interest. We also showed that the family of bivariate
discrete distributions with two points of support for both variables has some desirable
properties as a model for the distribution of the unobserved components. These properties
refer to flexibility as well as to the ease of interpretation of estimation results in terms of
underlying population characteristics.
The empirical analysis suggests that unobserved explanatory variables for the duration of
panel survey participation of an individual are not related to unobserved explanatory variables
for the duration of unemployment of that individual. It seems, therefore, that survey
participation duration is independent of unemployment duration. Consequently, in the
empirical analysis of unemployment durations using panel data, spells that are incomplete due
to attrition may be treated as spells that are subject to independent right-censoring. The results
are confirmed by a number of sensitivity checks.
The empirical analysis using job spells shows a negative relation between job duration and
the duration of survey participation. However, for the estimates of the exit rate out of a job

it does not matterwhetherwe take accountof this or not, so, for simplicity,we might as well

ignore it. It should be noted, however, that this result may be due to the abundant retrospective
information on elapsed job durations that is present in the data set used.
Since there could be a more direct relationship between the two types of duration (survey
participation and labour market spell) than the relation by way of unobserved determinants,
we also estimate an alternative model. In this model a fraction of the individuals who start
working in a new job leave the panel at the moment they start working in that job. However,
we find this phenomenon to be empirically unimportant.
The models that are estimated are restrictive in the sense that they are heavily parameterized.
A topic for further research would be to replicate the empirical analysis using more flexible
specifications. In that case larger samples would be necessary, both in terms of numbers of
respondents per wave and in terms of numbers of waves. Models allowing for nonmonotonic
duration dependence may be used to detect wave-specific effects in the exit out of the panel.
Another topic for further research would be to estimate a model that simultaneously describes
the durations of unemployment and employment, and the duration of panel survey
participation. Such an analysis would integrate the two empirical analyses in this paper. Note
that in that case we would have a three-dimensional distribution of unobserved heterogeneity.
By using multi-state multi-spell data, the results may be less sensitive to the Mixed
Proportional Hazard assumption.
