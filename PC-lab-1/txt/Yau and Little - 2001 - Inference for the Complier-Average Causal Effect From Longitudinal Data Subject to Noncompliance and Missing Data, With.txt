Inference for the Complier-Average Causal Effect
From Longitudinal Data Subject to Noncompliance
and Missing Data, With Application to a Job
Training Assessment for the Unemployed
Linda H.Y. Yau and Roderick J. Little
Longitudinal studies involving human participants are often complicated by subjects who do not comply with their treatment assignment
or do not provide complete data. A treatment effect of interest in the presence of noncompliance is the complier-average causal
effect (CACE; Imbens and Rubin 1997a), which is the treatment effect for subjects who would comply regardless of the assigned
treatment. Imbens and Rubin (1997a,b) proposed maximum likelihood and Bayesian inferential methods for CACE, which make explicit
assumptions for causal inference in the presence of noncompliance and are more ef cient than standard instrumental variable methods.
A model for inference about the CACE based on this approach is developed which allows for the inclusion of baseline covariates and
handles missing data in the repeated outcome measures. Our methods are applied to a randomized trial of a job training intervention for
unemployed workers. Results suggest that the intervention trial signi cantly reduced depression for high-risk compliers up to six months
postintervention but not for low-risk compliers.

INTRODUCTION

Noncompliance and attrition often complicate the statistical
analysis of longitudinal studies. Noncompliance arises when
subjects fail to comply with their assigned treatment. Attrition
arises when subjects prematurely drop out from the study due
to side effects, loss to follow-up, or subject withdrawal. We
address these issues in the context of the JOBS II intervention trial (Vinokur, Price, and Schul 1995), a study that tested
the effectiveness of a job training intervention for preventing deterioration in mental health as a result of job loss, and
facilitating high quality reemployment. After administration
of a questionnaire to collect baseline information and determine their eligibility, 1801 subjects were randomly assigned to
either an experimental treatment group or to a control group.
The experimental treatment consisted of a  ve half-day jobsearch seminar designed to help the participants enhance their
job search strategies. The control treatment was an instruction
booklet on job search. This booklet was mailed to respondents
not invited to the seminar and was also mailed to respondents invited to the seminar. Follow-up questionnaires were
mailed to these respondents two months (T2), six months
(T3), and two years (T4) after the week of the intervention seminar. Demographic variables and measures of depression,  nancial strain, assertiveness, risk, distress, role and
emotional functioning, job-search ef cacy, self-esteem, mastery, and reemployment were obtained or constructed from the
questionnaires. Noncompliance arises in that 46% of subjects
who were randomized to the seminar did not show up, and
in effect received the control treatment. Subjects in this group
continued to be followed and have outcome data collected.

Attrition refers to losses to follow-up from T2 to T4 among
subjects in both the experimental and the control groups. Nonmonotone patterns of missing data where subjects were missing at some follow-up times and reentered the study are also
handled by our methods.
Two kinds of analyses can be distinguished in randomized
studies such as JOBS II. An intent-to-treat ( IT) analysis compares the outcome of subjects by randomization groups (an
“as-randomized” analysis), ignoring compliance information.
The IT-effect measures the effect of treatment randomization
rather than the effect of treatment for those who actually
received it. The IT estimator is protected from the selection
bias by randomized treatment allocation, but is distorted as a
measure of the effect of treatment by noncompliance. Alternatively, subjects can be classi ed according to the treatments
actually received (an “as-treated” analysis). Then the problem
is that randomization is violated and confounding factors associated with switching potentially corrupt the causal interpretation of treatment effects. Because both of these approaches to
analysis have problems, in practice both “as-randomized” and
“as-treated” analyses are often carried out when assessing the
effects of treatments. Attempts have also been made to provide
adjustments or bounds to the treatment effect in the presence
of noncompliance (Balke and Pearl 1997; Baker 1998; Robins
and Finkelstein 2000). Recently, Rotnitzky, Scharfstein, Su,
and Robins (2001) proposed a semiparametric cause-speci c
selection model that can be used to assess sensitivity of the
treatment effect in the presence of attrition.
1.1

The CACE

Our focus here is on a particular form of ”as-treated” analysis where inference concerns the complier-average causal
effect (CACE) ( Imbens and Rubin 1997a), the average effect
of treatment in the subpopulation of compliant subjects. The

Yau and Little: Inference for the Complier-Average Causal Effect

1233

CACE is commonly known as the local average treatment
effect (LATE) in Economics literature (e.g., Imbens and
Angrist 1994; Imbens and Rubin 1997b). In a previous article (Little and Yau 1998), we applied maximum-likelihood
(ML)-based methods of inference for the CACE proposed
by Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin (1996, henceforth A IR) and
Imbens and Rubin (1997a,b) to a scalar depression outcome
from the JOBS II study, ignoring issues of attrition. This article generalizes that work by formulating and  tting a model
for longitudinal JOBS II data subject to attrition and noncompliance, using ML and Bayesian inferential methods.
To de ne the CACE more precisely in our setting, consider
a longitudinal study involving initial allocation to an active
or an experimental treatment (R D 1) and a control treatment
(R D 0). Let Y be a ’  1 vector of repeated measures on
the outcome of interest, and initially assume that this vector
is fully recorded for all subjects. Let Ti 4Ri 5 be the treatment
received for respondent i randomized to treatment Ri . Let Œ1
and Œ0 be the ’  1 population mean potential outcomes of
respondents assigned to experimental and control treatments,
respectively, perhaps in subpopulations de ned by the values of between-subject covariates. Then the average IT effect
of treatment, which A IR call the population average causal
effect of treatment assignment R on outcome Y , is de ned as
„ D Œ1 ƒ Œ0 . If yN1 and yN0 are the sample mean vectors of outcomes for subjects randomized to the experimental and control
groups respectively, then yN1 ƒ yN0 is an unbiased estimate of „.
The average treatment effect for compliers, or the CACE, is
de ned as:
„c D Œc1 ƒ Œc0 1

(1)

where Œc1 and Œc0 are the mean outcomes of the population
of compliers when assigned to experimental and control treatments, respectively. The CACE is the average causal effect
of treatment received T on outcome Y restricted to compliers. It is arguably a more relevant effect of interest than the
IT effect, because only those who took the treatment would
be able to bene t from the treatment if there was in fact a
treatment effect. If there is a perfect compliance in all the randomized groups, that is, Ri D Ti 4R i 5 for all participants, then
the CACE is the same as the average IT effect of R on Y .
If the compliance status of all the respondents in the study
is known, then „c can be estimated simply by the difference
between the treatment and the control means in the subsample
of compliers. However, in the JOBS II study, the compliance
status of subjects in the control group is unknown because we
do not know if they would have complied with the experimental treatment if they had been assigned to it. This complicates
the estimation of the CACE.
1.2

Estimation of the CACE

An instrumental variable ( IV) estimator of the CACE in the
presence of noncompliance is given by:
dc D 4yN1 ƒ yN0 5=pc 1

(2)

(e.g., Bloom 1984) where yN1 and yN0 are de ned above and pc is
the sample proportion of compliers in the experimental group,
and estimates the population proportion of compliers  c .

Imbens and Rubin (1997a, b) proposed a causal framework
for inference about the CACE that yields an alternative to
(2). The extension of their framework to a vector outcome,
ignoring attrition, is immediate. Imbens and Rubin (1997a, b)
classify participants into four types: compliers, de ers, nevertakers, and always-takers. Compliers are people who would
adopt the treatment assigned, de ers are those who would
adopt the opposite treatment to their assignment, never-takers
are people who always take the control treatment regardless
of what they are assigned, and always-takers are people who
always take the active treatment regardless of what they are
assigned. So, for compliers, Ti 415 D 1 and Ti 405 D 0; for
de ers, Ti 415 D 0 and Ti 405 D 1; for never-takers, Ti 415 D
Ti 405 D 0; and for always-takers, Ti 415 D Ti 405 D 1. Let Ci
denote the compliance status of the participant, where Ci D 1
for compliers and Ci D 0 for noncompliers, that is, de ers,
never-takers, and always-takers. In practice, knowledge of the
compliance status Ci of subjects is very often incomplete.
Imbens and Rubin (1997a) treat compliance as a missing-data
problem. Speci cally, if a subject is assigned to the new treatment and complies, then Ti 415 D 1, and that subject may be
a complier (if Ti 405 D 0) or an always-taker (if Ti 405 D 1). If
a subject is assigned to the new treatment and fails to comply, then Ti 415 D 0 and that subject may be a never-taker (if
Ti 405 D 0) or a de er (if Ti 405 D 1). If a subject is assigned to
the control treatment and complies, then Ti 405 D 0, and that
subject may be a complier (if Ti 415 D 1) or an never-taker (if
Ti 415 D 0). If a subject is assigned to the control treatment
and obtains the new treatment, then Ti 405 D 1, and that subject
may be an always-taker (if Ti 415 D 1) or a de er (if Ti 415 D 0).
Let yi 4Ri 1 Ti 5 be the potential ’  1 vector of outcomes for
respondent i, who was randomized to group Ri and received
treatment Ti . Implicit in this notation is the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) (Lewis 1963; Rubin 1978;
Imbens and Rubin 1997a, b), de ned as:
Assumption (1) (SUTVA). The potential outcome for each
individual i does depend on the treatment status of other individuals in the sample.
With Assumption (1), the individual level causal effect can
be de ned. The unit level causal effect of R on T for respondent i is de ned by Ti 415 ƒ Ti 405, and the unit level causal
effect of R on Y is de ned by yi 411 Ti 4155 ƒ yi 401 Ti 4055. Note
that the causal effect of R on Y is generally not observable,
because respondents are assigned to either the experimental
or the control treatment but not to both. However, the average
causal effects can be estimated by the average causal effects
over groups of respondents in a randomized trial. In addition,
the following assumption allows us to identify the causal effect
of T on Y meaningfully:
Assumption (2) (Exclusion Restriction). The treatment
assignment R is unrelated to the potential outcomes given
the treatment received T —Exclusion Restriction of Treatment
Assignment given Treatment Received.
The Exclusion Restriction implies that yi 411 Ti 5 D yi 401 Ti 5
for Ti D 01 1, so that the potential outcomes can now be de ned
as a function of T alone, namely, yi 4Ti 5. Also, the unit level
causal effect of T on Y for respondent i is then de ned by

yi 415 ƒ yi 405. Under Assumptions (1), (2), and the following additional assumptions, the CACE, „c , given by (1) (or
referred to as the LATE in A IR) can be estimated from the
data ( Imbens and Rubin 1997a, b):
Assumption (3) (Monotonicity). There are no de ers—
Monotonicity of Treatment Assignment and Treatment
Received;
Assumption (4) (Nonzero Denominator). For the population of compliers, the proportion of compliers taking the active
treatment is nonzero; and
Assumption (5) (Randomization). Treatment assignment is
random.
Under these assumptions, the CACE („c ) is the same as
the instrumental variable estimand ( IVE) („üc D „= c ), that is,
„c D „üc , hence the CACE or the average of the unit level
causal effects yi 415 ƒ yi 405 for the subpopulation of compliers characterized by Ti 415 D 1 and Ti 405 D 0 can be estimated by taking the ratio of the average of the unit level
causal effect of R on Y and the average of the unit level
causal effect of R on T . This formulation makes explicit
assumptions that were hidden in previous derivations. Bloom
(1984) argued that the IV estimator (2) is valid if (a) there
are no missing data and (b) the randomization assumption
(5) holds. Under these assumptions, dc is an unbiased estimator of the IVE „üc , but this does not imply that „c D „üc ,
which is required for Bloom’s estimator to be a valid estimator of the CACE. The additional assumptions (1)–(4) are
needed to assure that „c D „üc . Given assumptions (1), (3)–(5)
(5), the population mean potential outcomes for respondents
randomized to the experimental and control groups, namely,
Œ1 and Œ0 , can be expressed as the weighted proportions of
the mean potential outcomes of the population of compliers
and noncompliers. Speci cally, Œ1 D  c Œc1 C 41 ƒ  c 5Œnc1 and
Œ0 D  c Œc0 C 41 ƒ  c 5Œnc0 , where Œnc1 and Œnc0 are the mean
outcomes of the population of noncompliers when assigned to
the experimental and control treatments, respectively. In particular, Assumption (2), the exclusion restriction, plays a key
role, because by virtue of the assumption, Œnc1 D Œnc0 , which
implies that Œ1 ƒ Œ0 D  c 4Œc1 ƒ Œc0 5, or equivalently, „üc D „c .
Another advantage of the Imbens and Rubin (1997a) formulation is that it suggests more ef cient estimators of the CACE
than the IV estimator (2).
In this article, we extend Imbens and Rubin’s methods to the
estimation of CACE for longitudinal data subject to noncompliance and attrition, and apply the methodology to the JOBS
II trial. Section 2 provides more information on the design
of JOBS II and the problems of noncompliance and attrition
in that study. Section 3 presents the longitudinal model used
for the JOBS II trial, and discusses ML and Bayesian inference. Results of the JOBS II analysis appear in Section 4, and
Section 5 presents conclusions and further discussion.

2.1

JOBS II INTERVENTION PROJECT

Design of JOBS II

Past research has shown that job loss has adverse effects
on workers’ social and psychological functioning, physical

health, and on the family (Catalano and Dooley 1977; Cobb
and Kasl 1977; Justice and Duncan 1977; Dew, Bromet, and
Schulberg 1987; Vinokur, Caplan, and Williams 1987; Kessler,
Turner, and House 1988, 1989; Catalano 1991). Although it
is perceived that the problems that result from unemployment have to be addressed by national and state social and
economic policies (Blinder 1987), efforts can be undertaken
to reduce the social and psychological impact of unemployment at the local level. The JOBS Intervention Project developed at the University of Michigan was designed to test a
preventive intervention for unemployed workers. The goals
of the intervention were to prevent deterioration in mental
health of unemployed workers as a result of job loss and
to promote high quality reemployment. Analyses of the data
provided evidence that the intervention had accomplished its
goals (Caplan, Vinokur, Price, and van Ryn 1989). In addition,
it was demonstrated that the intervention provided bene cial
mental health effects primarily to a subset of respondents who
were identi ed at a high risk of experiencing clinical signi cant setback in mental health such as experiencing a depression episode (Price, van Ryn, and Vinokur 1992). High-risk
respondents were those identi ed with higher combined scores
on depressive symptoms,  nancial strain, and low assertiveness at pretest. These variables are prominent risk factors for
poor mental health and continued unemployment of persons
who lose their job (Kessler, Turner, and House 1988). In this
article, we focus on the analysis of the JOBS II study, which
was an extension of the original JOBS project that included
advance screening and oversampling of high-risk job losers
who might bene t most from the intervention. Our primary
variable of interest is depression, because depression symptoms have been shown to reduce the chances of employment
due to their effects on the motivation for, and effectiveness of,
job-search behavior (Hamilton, Hoffman, Broman, and Rauma
1993). It is anticipated that if the JOBS intervention is more
effective in reducing the depression symptomatology among
high-risk than low-risk respondents, it would also be more
effective in improving reemployment of the high-risk than
low-risk respondents.
JOBS II compared an experimental treatment consisting of
a  ve half-day job-search seminar, which helped the unemployed to enhance their job-search strategies, with a control
treatment consisting of an instruction booklet on job search.
Respondents were recruited at the four of ces of the Michigan
Employment Security Commission in southeastern Michigan.
Among the 31,560 people contacted, over 23,000 were ineligible for participation because they were new entrants to the
labor market, already employed, or were just accompanying
others in line. Only 3402 respondents who  lled out a screening questionnaire (T0), met all the screening criteria (reporting
to be looking for a job, not being on strike or expecting to be
recalled, or planning to retire in the next 2 years, within 13
weeks of losing job, no preference between control and experimental programs, absence of very high depression score).
To prevent selection and attrition bias due to a strong preference for the experimental or the control treatment, respondents who indicated a preference for one of the treatments
or who refused both treatments were excluded from the sample. There were 2,445 low-risk and 957 high-risk respon-

Yau and Little: Inference for the Complier-Average Causal Effect

dents among the 3,402 who met the criteria. The oversampling of the high-risk respondents in the sample was achieved
by randomly selecting 1,507 low-risk respondents from the
2,445 respondents, so that the proportion of high-risk respondents in the sample was increased from 28% to 39%. As a
result, a total of 2,464 respondents were invited and randomized to the  eld study. All respondents subject to randomization were mailed a pretest (T1) questionnaire. A total of
1,801 respondents who returned their T1 questionnaire were
enrolled to the study, with 552 and 1,249 respondents in the
control and experimental groups, respectively. After the intervention seminar, respondents randomized to the experimental
group were also mailed the same instructional booklet sent to
the control group. Follow-up questionnaires were mailed to all
respondents two months (T2), six months (T3), and two years
(T4) after the week of the intervention seminar. Demographic
variables such as age, sex, education, marital status, occupation, family income, and race were collected from the survey
questionnaires. In addition, measures for depression,  nancial
strain, assertiveness, risk, distress, role and emotional functioning, job-search ef cacy, self-esteem, internal control orientation, and mastery were constructed from the questionnaires,
based on responses from a 5-point rating scale. Speci cally,
depression was measured from the responses to a 11-item list
based on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (Derogatis, Lipman,
Rickles, Uhlenuth, and Covi 1974);  nancial strain was measured from responses to a 3-item index; assertiveness was
based on responses from a 4-item index; risk score was computed by a formula developed by Price et al. (1992) using
the depression,  nancial strain, and assertiveness scores; distress was measured from an 18-item index; role and emotional functioning from a 15-item index (Caplan et al. 1984);
job-search ef cacy from a 6-item list; self-esteem from an 8item list from Rosenberg’s (1965) self-esteem scale; internal
control orientation from an 10-item list based on the original
Rotter I–E scale (Gurin, Gurin, and Morrison 1978); and mastery was computed by the mean scores of job-search ef cacy,
self-esteem, and internal control orientation.
2.2

Noncompliance and Attrition in JOBS II

About 46% of the subjects who were randomized to the
seminar did not show up, and are treated as noncompliers.
Subjects in this group continued to be followed and have outcome data collected. Missing values in the longitudinal data
at times T2–T4 occur when follow-up questionnaires are not
returned from respondents who were randomized to the experimental and the control groups. Response rates at T2, T3,
and T4 were 80%, 87%, and 79%, respectively. We assume
that if compliance status was known, the missing-data mechanism would be ignorable for likelihood inferences (Rubin
1976; Little and Rubin 1987; Little 1995), so that a model is
not needed for the attrition mechanism. This is the “ignorability” assumption for the missing-data mechanism. It implies,
in particular, that the missing data are missing at random conditional on compliance status, in that missingness does not
depend on the values of missing outcomes, after conditioning on treatment group, compliance status, baseline covariates,
and the values of observed outcomes. Information to assess

1235

this assumption is not available, but it is rendered more plausible by the considerable amount of information available to
characterize incomplete cases.
In the JOBS II setting, the intervention seminar was only
offered to those randomized to the experimental group. Those
randomized to the control group had no way of receiving the
intervention, so in terms of the A IR terminology, there are no
de ers or always-takers in the study, only compliers and nevertakers. Let Ri be the randomization indicator, taking the value
1 if the ith respondent was randomized to the experimental
group, and otherwise 0; let Ti be the indicator for the treatment actually received by the ith respondent, taking the value
1 if the ith respondent received the experimental treatment and
otherwise 0; and let Ci D 1 if the ith respondent is a complier
and Ci D 0 if the ith respondent is a never-taker. For compliers, Ti 4Ri 5 D Ri for Ri D 01 1; for never-takers, Ti 4Ri 5 D 0 for
R i D 01 1. Table 1 summarizes the missing data pattern of Ci in
JOBS II. There are no missing data for Ci in the experimental
group, the shows (N11 ) in the intervention would solely be compliers, whereas the no-shows (N10 ) would all be never-takers.
There are both compliers and never-takers in the control group
(N00 ), and the compliance status of respondents in that group
is unknown, because we do not know if they would comply
if assigned to the treatment. The estimation of the CACE, „c ,
in this application is complicated by the fact that compliance
status is unknown for respondents in the control group.
We now assess the assumptions concerning noncompliance
underlying the estimation of CACE in the JOBS II setting.
Assumptions (3) and (4) are clearly satis ed in JOBS II. The
combination of these two assumptions gives the strict monotonicity of treatment assignment on treatment received, which
implies the absence of de ers and the presence of at least one
complier. This condition is satis ed because participants randomized to the control group had no way of attending the
intervention, so the presence of de ers is impossible in the
JOBS II design. Also, there is more than one complier because
more than one subject participated in the intervention.
Assumptions (1) and (2) are more questionable in this application. The SUTVA (1) implies that the potential outcome
of a participant does not depend on the treatment status of
other participants. This assumption might not hold if a participant actively contributes to the discussions in the seminar and
hence affects the outcomes of other participants in the seminar. The potential outcome of participants in the treated group
then would be dependent on whether or not this in uential participant is selected to be in the experimental group. Although
the SUTVA is a nontrivial assumption for interventions like
JOBS II that involve group interactions, it appears dif cult
to correct for violations of this assumption, at least without

further information on how the participants interacted during the seminar. Assumption (2), the Exclusion Restriction of
Treatment Assignment given Treatment Received, states that
the outcome is independent of the treatment assignment given
the actual treatment received. This assumption together with
SUTVA and treatment randomization are the key assumptions
for the treatment assignment indicator R to be an instrumental
variable. It would be violated if the effect of no treatment for
those randomized to the experimental group is not the same as
the effect of no treatment for those in the control group; this
might happen if a subject was randomized to the experimental
group and did not comply, was demoralized by the inability
to take advantage of the opportunity, whereas the same person
randomized to control treatment would be less demoralized
because the intervention was never offered.
The missing-data patterns of the change in depression scores
from baseline T0 for the high- and low-risk groups from T2
to T4 are shown in Table 2. The 3-digit indicator in the tables
represents the missing-data pattern for times T2, T3, and T4,
with a one indicating missing outcome at that time, and a zero
indicating observed outcome at that time. For example, a 010
pattern, represents observed outcomes at T2, T4, and a missing outcome at T3. About 64% of the high-risk group and 67%
of the low-risk group had observed outcomes at all the time
points, while others have one or more missing outcomes from
T2 to T4. The attrition pattern for the same participant type
are similar among the high-risk and low-risk groups. The proportion of experimental compliers who had complete data at

all the follow-up times is greater than that of the control group
or the experimental noncompliers, which is re ective of the
complying behavior and also suggestive of possible positive
effects of the experimental treatment. Moreover, the proportion
of experimental noncompliers who did not have any followup data is about twice of that in the control group (8.7% in
experimental noncompliers versus 4.7% in control for high-risk
respondents; 9.7% in experimental noncompliers versus 4.7%
in control for low-risk respondents). This  nding might be seen
as indirect evidence against the exclusion restriction, because
subjects demoralized by failure to take advantage of the intervention might be expected to drop out of the study to a greater
extent than the controls. However, the experimental noncompliers are a self-selected subgroup whereas the controls are not,
and differences in attrition between these groups could re ect
their lack of comparability rather than evidence that the exclusion restriction is violated.
3. MODEL
Our proposed model is an extension of the general location
model (Olkin and Tate 1961) for mixed continuous and categorical data with missing data (Little and Schluchter 1985)
to include  xed covariates. For subject i (i D 11 : : : 1 N ), let
yi denote the ’  1 vector of outcomes, XYi be a set of  xed
covariates predictive of yi , Ri be the randomization group indicator (1 for treatment, 0 for control), and Ci the compliance
indicator (1 for complier, 0 for never-taker). In our full model,

estimates of ˆ can be computed by the EM algorithm (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977), treating the compliance indicators for subjects in the control group and the unobserved components of yi as missing data. Likelihood ratio tests can be
carried out to test the null hypotheses that particular components of ˆ are zero, and standard errors of the ML estimates
can be computed using the SEM algorithm (Meng and Rubin
1991) or by numerical methods such as the bootstrap. Inference about the CACE and other regression parameters can then
be based on the standard large-sample normal approximation.
An alternative approach to inference for the CACE is to
assume a prior distribution for the parameters and simulate
the posterior distribution using the Gibbs’ sampler ( Imbens
and Rubin 1997a; Tanner 1996), again treating the unobserved
compliance indicators and missing outcomes as missing data.
This Bayesian approach draws ˆ from their complete-data posterior distribution and draws the missing outcomes ymiss1 i from
their predictive distribution conditional on yobs1 i and ˆ. Computational details for both of these approaches are provided in
Appendixes A and B.

APPLICATION TO JOBS II

The model described in the previous section was  tted to
the JOBS II data. For the purpose of comparison, an IT analysis, as well as an IV estimation were also performed. Due
to the oversampling of the high-risk respondents and the prior
study showing bene cial effects for the high-risk group but
not for the low-risk group, analyses were performed separately for the low-risk and high-risk groups. The groups were
de ned by value of a risk score computed from  nancial strain
score, assertiveness score, and depression score at screening
(T0); subjects with a risk score greater or equal to 1.38 were
assigned to the high-risk group, and were assigned to the lowrisk group if it was otherwise. The outcome of interest is the
difference in depression scores between Tt and baseline T0,
for t D 21 31 4. A lower depression score indicates improvement, so a negative difference between depression scores at
Tt and T0 is a positive outcome. Subjects with missing outcomes at all time points are not included in the analyses; this
excludes about 5% and 6% of the high- and low-risk respondents, respectively from the analyses.
The model of (3) and (4) were  tted separately to highrisk and low-risk data sets, with yi D 4yi2 1 yi3 1 yi4 5T , where yit
is the difference in depression between Tt and baseline T0,
for t D 21 31 4. Covariates were chosen into model (3) if they
were signi cant predictors for the IT model at the .05 signi cance level. Covariates measured at baseline that signi cantly predict compliance were selected based on a logistic
regression model on the compliance information available for
the experimental group. Age, education (highest school grade
completed), motivation to attend, assertiveness at baseline,
marital status (unmarried or married), economic hardship at
baseline, and race (nonwhite or white) are signi cant in predicting compliance for the high-risk respondents. For low-risk
respondents, age, education, motivation to attend, and income
level are signi cant predictors of compliance. Reduced models with ‚CX1t D ‚CRX1t D 0 in (3) were also  tted to the data.
The ML estimates and Bayesian posterior distribution with
uniform priors on all the parameters were computed, using the

procedures detailed in the appendices. Standard errors of the
ML estimates were computed based on 100 bootstrap samples
drawn from the observed sample with replacement.
The likelihood ratio test indicates that there is no signi cant
lack of  t of the reduced model (p-value of .99 for high-risk
group, p-value of .95 for low-risk group); hence, only estimates from the reduced model (‚CX1 t D ‚CRX 1 t D 0 in (3)) are
presented. Tables 3 and 4 give the EM and Gibbs parameter estimates from model (3) for the high-risk and low-risk
groups, respectively; standard errors of the parameter estimates are shown in parenthesis. The estimates from EM and
Gibbs are, in general, similar for both of the risk groups; however, estimates for ‚C and ‚CR from the two methods differ considerably. There are signi cant time effects (‚01t ) on
the change in depression scores in both of the risk groups,
with greatest magnitude of effect at T3, six months after intervention, a change of about 1.71 for the high-risk group and
about .95 for the low-risk group, respectively. The effect of
compliance (‚C1 t ) for controls, is not signi cant for both the
risk groups, but the CACE (‚CR1 t ) is signi cant for the highrisk group at T2 (two months post-intervention) and T3 (six
months post-intervention). CACE is greatest at T3 and smallest at T4 (two years after intervention) for both risk groups.
Estimates of the correlations of the change in outcomes at the
three time points, ij , are also given in Tables 3 and 4. For
both of the risk groups, the correlation between T2 and T3 is
greatest, whereas the correlation between T2 and T4 is smallest. It is to be expected that outcomes closer to each other
in time would be more correlated than outcomes further apart
in time. The results imply signi cant intervention effects for
high-risk compliers at two months and six months after the
intervention, with greater effects at T3; suggesting that there

is intervention effect for high-risk compliers up to six months
but negligible effects at two years after the intervention.
The EM and Gibbs parameter estimates for the logistic
regression model (4) for compliance are given in Table 5.
The model for the high-risk group predicts better compliance
for respondents who are white, unmarried, older, more educated, less assertive, have less economic hardship, and more
motivation to attend. For low-risk respondents, compliance is
predicted to be higher for respondents who are older, more
educated, at a higher income level, and have greater motivation to attend. These effects are generally in the expected
directions.
These estimates can also be compared with those from
IV estimation. An IV estimator in the longitudinal case is
obtained by  tting a multivariate version of Bloom’s model
(1984) using SAS Proc Mixed (SAS 1992), with outcomes yi
and regression parameters now as vectors with three entries.
Subjects with missing outcomes at two or less time points
were included in the analysis by using the SAS Proc Mixed
procedure. The model assumes that the outcomes follow a
multivariate normal distribution with means

for t D 21 31 4, and an unstructured covariance matrix, where
‚0 is the effect for controls, ‚CR is the effect for experimental shows, ‚N S is the effect for experimental no-shows,
and ‚X is the effect of covariates, i D 11 : : : 1 N . Covariates included in this model are the same as those in the IT
model as well as those in model (3). Likelihood ratio tests

computed in terms of the model parameter estimates of (5) is

of the average compliance rate of subjects over all the covariates XYi . The estimated average compliance rate (pOc ) based on
the observed sample is .55 for the high-risk group and .56 for
the low-risk group. Standard errors for the IV estimates are
again obtained by bootstrap. The parameters estimates of this
model as well as the IVE are also shown in Tables 3 and 4.
Finally, a longitudinal IT model was  tted to the outcomes
of interest yi D 4yi2 1 yi3 1 yi4 5, where yit is the difference in

The outcomes yi are assumed to follow a multivariate nor-

mal model with means E4yit 5 D ‚01 t C ‚R1 t Ri C ‚TX1t XYi C
‚TRX 1 t Ri XYi , t D 21 31 4 and an unstructured covariance matrix.
This model was  tted using SAS Proc Mixed (SAS 1992),
where subjects with missing outcomes at two or less time
points were included in the estimation. Covariates measured
at baseline that signi cantly predict change in depression are
included in the model. For the high-risk respondents, depression at baseline and the risk score signi cantly predict the
change in depression, whereas depression at baseline and marital status (unmarried or married) signi cantly predict change
in depression for the low-risk respondents. Note that in contrast to model (3), there are no effects of C and CR in the
IT model, but instead the main effect of R is present. There
is no signi cant lack of  t of the main effects model with
‚TRX 1t D 0 (the likelihood ratio test has a p-value of .98 for the
high-risk model and .49 for the low-risk model), hence, only

eter estimates and the corresponding standard errors from the
IT main effects models for the high- and low-risk groups
are shown in Tables 3 and 4. The IT effects are given by
‚R1 t , they are not signi cant at all the time points for both
the high-risk and low-risk groups. This result is quite unexpected, because signi cant intervention effects were expected
for high-risk respondents. However, for the high-risk group,
there are incremental IT effects at T3 (six months postintervention) when compared to the other time points.
The estimates for the low-risk group are, in general, similar for all the methods, because the estimated effects are small
and highly insigni cant. For the high-risk group, the CACE
estimates (‚CR ) are signi cant at T2 and T3, with an increased
intervention effect from T2 to T3 and a decrease in the effect
at T4 are indicated. Similarly, both the IV estimator and the
IT effect estimated an increase in effect from T2 to T3 and
a reduction in effect at T4 for the high-risk group; but both
the IV estimators and the IT effects are not signi cant at all
the time points. Although there were bene cial effects of the
intervention in reducing depression symptomatology for those
who complied in the high-risk group, due to the considerable
amount of high risk experimental noncompliers who were lost
to follow-up at one or more time points (>40%, see Table 2),
the magnitude of the estimated IT effect at each time point is
generally less than the corresponding IV estimates. Moreover,
the CACE estimates indicate greater compliance effects than
the corresponding IV estimates for the high-risk group at T2
and T3. Also note that the CACE estimates based on the longitudinal model generally have smaller standard errors than the
IV estimators, which is consistent with the theory suggesting
that the CACE is more ef cient than the IV estimator.
The CACE estimates from the three approaches look quite
different for this application. The difference in the estimates
of the CACE and IV estimand might be due to bias of the
IV estimator caused by missing data due to attrition. Table 6
shows the CACE and IV estimates when univariate analyses
on the difference in depression were performed at each of the
time points separately. In accordance with the  ndings in Yau
(1997) and Little and Yau (1998), the CACE estimates and the
corresponding standard errors for the univarate analyses are,
in general, similar between the two approaches. (The IV standard errors seem a bit smaller, but they are asymptotic and do
not take into account estimation of the compliance rate). The
gain in ef ciency in the CACE estimated by EM is not evident in the univariate analysis (see Table 6). This is in agreement with the simulation study results in Yau (1997), which
showed that for the univariate case, the CACE estimates and
standard errors from EM and Gibbs, and the IV estimate from
Bloom are in general quite similar. The univariate analyses
were restricted to cases where that outcome was observed, and
the difference in the cross-sectional and longitudinal CACE
estimates might be in part due to the handling of attrition in
the longitudinal case.

CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

The methods of Imbens and Rubin (1997a, b) for inference about CACE are extended to handle longitudinal data
with noncompliance. When extended to the longitudinal case,
in addition to incorporating the noncompliance of subjects in

the experimental treatment, subjects with incomplete observations over time can also be included in the analysis, and the
covariance structure of the outcomes can be modeled. The longitudinal model is applied to the JOBS II intervention project
for unemployed workers, to assess the effect of intervention
effect on change in depression scores between the follow-up
times Tt and baseline T0, where t D 21 31 4. The CACE estimated from the model suggests signi cant intervention effects
for the high-risk group at T2 and T3 but not at T4 or for
the low-risk group. This result is consistent with the previous
 nding (Vinokur et al. 1995) that the intervention is bene cial to high-risk respondents but not to low-risk respondents.
Our ML and Bayesian estimates are asymptotically optimal
under the assumed model, and should yield similar results
given large samples. In small or moderate samples, we believe
that the Bayesian approach may provide better inferences than
ML combined with the bootstrap, particularly when identi cation problems arise in  tting the model to bootstrapped
samples; simulations to assess this issue would be useful. We
have also not addressed the important question of robustness
to model misspeci cation. Simulation studies that compared
our proposed approach with the IV method on normal and nonnormal populations would be of interest. Our likelihood-based
approach could be readily extended to handle nonnormal distributions, such as the multivariate t (Lange, Little, and Taylor
1989).
An attractive feature of the Imbens and Rubin’s framework
is the increase in ef ciency of estimation over the instrumental variable approach. The gain arises from the fact that the
ML method exploits the fact that the density functions of the
distributions of compliers and noncompliers under the control
treatment are positive. This gain is consistent with the  nding in the JOBS II application that the standard errors of the
EM and Gibbs estimates are generally lower than those of the
IV estimators. Imbens and Rubin (1997b) presented a simulation study with low rates of compliance where gains from ML
approach are important, using a nonparametric version of the
model for scalar outcomes.
Another feature of the Imbens and Rubin approach is that
it makes explicit the assumptions necessary for valid estimates of the CACE in the presence of noncompliance. These
assumptions tend to be hidden in earlier formulations for
causal inference. In particular, the assumptions of SUTVA and
the exclusion restriction of treatment assigned given treatment
received are usually not obviously satis ed in preventive trials
like JOBS II. Methods for addressing and correcting violations
of these assumptions are not well developed and provide a
promising area for future research. Along these lines, Imbens
and Rubin (1997a) proposed a Bayesian sensitivity analysis

Yau and Little: Inference for the Complier-Average Causal Effect

to assess the impact of violations of the exclusion restriction.
It is also possible to extend the current model to handle different levels of treatment, by assuming at the unit level that
given the level of treatment received, the outcome of interest
is unrelated to the treatment assignment.
Here, we assumed that the missing-data mechanism is
ignorable, but it would be useful to determine sensitivity
of results to alternative assumptions about the missing-data
mechanism. In particular, Frangakis and Rubin (1999) consider an alternative assumption, called “latent ignorability,”
which assumes ignorability conditional on compliance status,
but allows missingness to depend on the compliance status,
which is missing in the control group. This assumption is
weaker than ignorability condition, and the model is identi ed
by strengthening the compound exclusion restriction to apply
to both outcomes and drop-outs. Modi cations of our methods to  t latent ignorable versions of our model are discussed
in Peng (2001).

This complete-data log-likelihood belongs to the exponential family, with complete-data suf cient statistics yi yiT , Ci yiT , and Ci , for
i D 11 : : : 1 N . Hence, ML estimates for ˆ D 41 ‚1 è5 can then be
obtained via the EM algorithm for exponential families (Sundberg
1974; Little and Rubin 1987). The E-step computes expected values
of the complete-data suf cient statistics given the current parameter
estimates and the observed data. The M-step computes new parameter
estimates by the complete-data ML estimates, replacing the completedata suf cient statistics with estimates from the E-step. The E- and
M-steps are then repeated until convergence. For this application,
there are two levels of E and M steps embedded within each other:
the E1 and M1 steps for the logistic regression model (4); and the
E2 and M2 steps for the repeated measures model (3). The algorithm
starts with the E1-step, iterates between the E2 and M2-steps, then
followed by the M1-step. These steps are repeated until convergence.
We now describe these steps in more detail.

model are obtained by weighted logistic regression, with subjects in

the control group being assigned weights equal to —xi for being a
complier (Ci D 1) and weights equal to 1 ƒ —xi for being a nevertaker (Ci D 0), where values of —xi are given by (A.1).
Once converged estimates of , ‚, and è are obtained, the ML
parameter estimates of ˆ are updated by ˆ 4hC15 = ( 4hC15 , ‚4hC15 ,
è4hC15 ), where  4hC15 is from the M1-step, ‚4hC15 and è4hC15 are from

Step 2
The second step draws the unknown values of Ci from its conditional distribution given observed values and current drawn values of

is given by (A.1) evaluated at the current parameter values ˆ 4hC15 .
Flat priors are used for all the parameters. In particular, uniform
distributions from ƒ 200 to 200 are used for the logistic regression
parameters and the longitudinal regression parameters. This range
essentially covers all plausible values of the model parameters. For
è, the prior distribution used is proportional to —è—4’ C15=2 , where ’ is
the length of the outcome vector of interest (’ D 3 for the JOBS II
application).
Two independent sequences of 2n sets of draws were generated for
each model, with the  rst n iterations of each sequence discarded to
eliminate the effect of starting values, and model inference was based
on the remaining 2n iterations from the two sequences. Standard
errors of parameter estimates are given by the standard deviations of
the parameters in the combined sequence. The method of Gelman
and Rubin (1992) was used to monitor convergence of the sequence.
