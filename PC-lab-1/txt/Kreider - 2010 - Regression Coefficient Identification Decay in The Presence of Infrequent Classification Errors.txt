9 As a technical note, the curves depicted in the figures exclude values
of px that are logically incompatible with the selected values of /?0, Pi,
and c12. For a distribution of three dichotomous variables, not all correlation matrices are possible. Incompatible combinations of p0, pu p2, and
C'2 are identified using a simple algorithm provided in Chaganty and Joe
(2006).
10 Intuitively, if the variance of Xx is small, then there are few observations involving either Xx = 1 or Xx = 0. Since misreporting might be concentrated within these few observations, the potential impact of errors on
coefficients is large. Since errors in X2 may systematically occur for a particular value of X2, larger lc12l results in greater uncertainty about the true

values of Ã or 8. Details are available on request.
