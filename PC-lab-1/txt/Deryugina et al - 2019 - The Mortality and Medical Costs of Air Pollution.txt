A. Source of identifying variation

We estimate the effect of pollution on mortality and health utilization over a broad geographic area

without requiring a detailed “case study” of each individual location. In this section, we illustrate the
variation in pollution that drives our results and explicitly test for concerns that may arise when using
variation in pollution from an unspecified source.
To illustrate the relationship between wind and pollution for each of our monitor groups, we first
estimate the following regression separately for each of the 100 monitor groups described in the main text:

The variables 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑝𝑝𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 correspond to temperature bins, while 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑝𝑝𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 and 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 correspond to
precipitation and wind speed deciles, respectively, following the definitions in equations (1) and (2) of the

main text. The function 𝑓𝑓(⋅) represents all their possible interactions. Likewise, the fixed effects follow

equations (1) and (2). Equation (A1) differs from the first stage of the instrumental variable regressions
estimated in the main text in three minor ways: (1) to demonstrate the source of our variation in more detail,
it employs 10-degree bins for 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 instead of 90-degree bins; (2) because we are interested in the

relationship between daily wind direction and daily fine particulate matter, this specification excludes leads
and lags 1; and (3) it does not employ county-population weights. Including more wind direction bins in our

main analysis is computationally burdensome due to the large number of additional regressors it generates,
though we do perform a robustness check to demonstrate the invariance of our results to more wind
direction bins in Table 9.
Online Appendix Figure A1 plots estimates of 𝛽𝛽̂𝑏𝑏 (solid black lines), along with their corresponding

95 percent confidence intervals (shaded grey area), for each of the monitor groups in our main sample. 2

The San Francisco Bay Area in California (“Santa Clara, CA”) and the Boston, MA area (“Middlesex,
MA”) are reproduced in Figures 2 and 3 in the main text. For most monitor groups, there is a strong and
clear relationship between local wind direction and changes in PM 2.5.
Our empirical approach raises the concern that a small number of monitors located close to local
pollution sources may drive our first-stage results, while monitors located far from those sources may

Leads were included in our main specification because our outcome variable there was three-day mortality and lags
were included to minimize concerns about autocorrelation.

exhibit no significant relationship between wind direction and pollution. If this is the case, then our
estimates of the effect of pollution will be driven by local sources near pollution monitors, resulting in
potentially significant measurement error. Because we do not observe pollution sources, we cannot test for
this directly. However, we can provide indirect evidence by testing for the presence of outliers and by
investigating whether the patterns from our first stage are similar for monitor groups located close together.
To that end, we conduct two tests.
In the first test, we split each of our monitor groups into two random subgroups. We then estimate
equation (A1) separately for each subgroup and compare the subgroup estimates to each other and to the
group average. Intuitively, if a handful of monitors located near local sources drive our first stage, then the
two subgroups should generate different results. By contrast, if the estimated patterns are driven by nonlocal transport, then the coefficients should be similar. As Figure A1 shows, for the vast majority of monitor
groups, the coefficients for each of the two subgroups (dashed red lines) are qualitatively and quantitatively
similar to each other and to the overall group average (solid black line), suggesting that our first stage is
not driven by locally-produced pollution measured by a handful of nearby monitors.
In the second test, we first classify monitors into 50 groups instead of 100, using the same
classification algorithm (kmeans). 3 We then match each monitor group from the 50-group classification to
all overlapping groups from the 100-group classification. That is, for each of the 50 groups, we find all
monitor groups in the 100-group set that have at least one monitor in common. Each of the 50 groups
overlaps with 3 to 7 groups from the 100-group classification. We expect to see similar patterns in the firststage estimates because these overlapping groups are located close to each other geographically, and air
pollution can be carried by the wind for hundreds of miles.
Online Appendix Figure A2 shows the estimated wind angle-pollution relationship in each of the
50 groups (solid black line) and the corresponding relationships in the overlapping groups from the 100group classification (dashed red lines). Intuitively, if the estimated patterns are driven by non-local
transport, then the estimated coefficients should be qualitatively and quantitatively similar. Indeed, this is
what we see in the vast majority of cases.

B. Medicare sample and mortality data

The baseline sample used in our analysis includes all Medicare beneficiaries ages 65–100 and is

derived from 100 percent Medicare enrollment information files for years 1999–2013. These annual files
include an observation for each beneficiary enrolled in Medicare for at least one day in that calendar year,

We have also replicated our main results with 50 monitor groups (see column (2) of Table 9 in the main text), and
they are very similar.

whether enrolled in Traditional Medicare (fee-for-service) or Medicare Advantage. The enrollment files
report a variety of demographic and enrollment variables, including unique beneficiary identifiers that can
be used to link individuals over time; monthly indicators for Medicare eligibility; state, county, and ZIP
code of residence based on the mailing address for official correspondence; and exact dates of birth and
death.
The vast majority of elderly living in the United States are enrolled in Medicare. The left panel of
Online Appendix Figure A3 compares the size of our baseline Medicare sample to Census estimates of the
US population ages 65 and over. To aid comparison, we use Census estimates of the resident population on
July 1 each year and limit the Medicare sample to beneficiaries who reside in the 50 states and the District
of Columbia and who turned 65 before July 1. Over the period 1999–2013, the Census estimates an average
of 38.1 million elderly individuals each year, compared to 37.7 million elderly in Medicare. Thus, the
Medicare sample covers over 98 percent of elderly living in the US, a share which remains roughly constant
over the sample period.
The mortality variables used in our analysis are based on dates of death recorded in the Medicare
enrollment files. Medicare's death data come primarily from the Social Security Administration but are
augmented based on reviews triggered by hospitalization claims indicating patient death. The annual
mortality rates in the Medicare data align closely with mortality rates based on National Vital Statistics
death records and Census population estimates, as shown in the right panel of Online Appendix Figure A3.
While all recorded deaths in the Medicare data are validated, some death dates in the data are not validated,
in which case they are assigned the last date in the month of death. Because our analysis is performed at
the daily level, we drop individuals who die at any point in the year and who do not have a validated death
date flag. This restriction affects less than 2 percent of the deaths in our sample, and the share of deaths
with unvalidated dates diminishes over time (see Online Appendix Figure A3).
To estimate PM 2.5 effects by cause of death, we use data from the National Death Index (NDI)
created by the Center for Disease Control and matched to Medicare beneficiaries who died in 1999–2008.
The NDI is a centralized database of death record information compiled from state vital statistics offices
and maintained by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). 4
We first categorize ICD-10 cause of death codes into 39 groups based on the NCHS's list of 39
selected causes of death. 5 We then group these 39 causes of death into four categories as follows:

external causes

C. Predicting life expectancy

We predict life expectancy using two different survival models: Cox proportional hazards, and

Survival Random Forest. 6 We estimate these models using individuals from our baseline sample who were
alive and eligible for Medicare in 2002 and then use the estimates from these models to predict life
expectancy for the other beneficiaries in our sample. To ensure that we have accurate measures of
beneficiaries’ baseline chronic conditions prior to 2002, we further limit the sample to Medicare
beneficiaries who, as of January 1, 2002, had been continuously enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare for at
least two years (and are thus at least 67 years old in 2002). We observe all deaths that occur among this
cohort on or before December 31, 2013. During this 12-year time period (2002–2013), over 50 percent of
our sample dies; the remaining deaths are censored. 7 For computational ease, we further limit the analysis
to a random 5 percent sample of these beneficiaries. The final estimation sample used in our survival
analysis includes 1,210,659 individuals.

C.1 Cox proportional hazards

The semi-parametric Cox proportional hazards model assumes that the hazard rate of death for

individual 𝑖𝑖 can be factored into two separate functions:

ℎ(𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 |𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 , 𝛽𝛽) = ℎ0 (𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 )exp[𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖′ 𝛽𝛽]

We also estimated fully parametric models that assume survival rates are governed by either the Gompertz or Weibull
distributions. Those yielded results similar to those from our preferred, less parametric, specifications.
7
Although earlier cohorts are observable for a longer period of time, we do not use them because the Medicare
variables denoting the presence of pre-existing chronic conditions, which are strong predictors of survival, are
nonexistent or unreliable in earlier years.
6

5

The hazard rate at time 𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 , ℎ(𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 |𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 , 𝛽𝛽), depends on the baseline hazard rate, ℎ0 (𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 ), and on a vector of

individual characteristics, 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 . The parameter vector 𝛽𝛽 is estimated by maximizing the log partial likelihood

function:

𝑁𝑁

ln 𝐿𝐿(𝛽𝛽) = � 𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖 �𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖′ 𝛽𝛽 − ln � exp[𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗′ 𝛽𝛽]� ,
𝑖𝑖=1

𝑗𝑗∈𝑅𝑅(𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 )

(A2)

where the indicator variable 𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖 is equal to one for individuals whose deaths we observe (uncensored

observations) and equal to zero otherwise. The risk set 𝑅𝑅(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘 ) = {𝑙𝑙: 𝑡𝑡𝑙𝑙 ≥ 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘 } is the set of observations at risk

of death at time 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘 and consists of all individuals who are alive at that time. Thus, individuals whose deaths

we do not observe (censored observations) affect the partial likelihood function only through the terms
indexed by 𝑗𝑗 in equation (A2).

Once 𝛽𝛽̂ has been obtained by maximizing the log partial likelihood, we nonparametrically estimate

the baseline hazard function following Breslow (1972):
ℎ�0 (𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 ) =

𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖

∑𝑗𝑗∈𝑅𝑅(𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖) exp[𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗′ 𝛽𝛽̂ ]

(A3)

The numerator, 𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 , is the number of deaths that occur at 𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 . The corresponding baseline survival function
is calculated as

�0 (𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 )]
𝑆𝑆̂0 (𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 ) = exp[−𝐻𝐻

𝑖𝑖
�0 (𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 ) is the cumulative hazard function, calculated as 𝐻𝐻
�0 (𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 ) = ∑𝑡𝑡𝜏𝜏=1
where 𝐻𝐻
ℎ�0 (𝜏𝜏). The individual-specific

survival function, which allows us to calculate life expectancy, can then be estimated as:
′�
𝑆𝑆̂�𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 �𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 , 𝛽𝛽̂ � = 𝑆𝑆̂0 (𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 )exp[𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽]

In practice, the nonparametric estimate of the baseline hazard function is limited to the 12 years of Medicare
data we have available for this survival analysis. We extrapolate the baseline hazard function to future years
by assuming it follows a log-linear form. As shown in Online Appendix Figure A4, this appears to be a
reasonable assumption.
The life-years lost analysis presented in the main text varies the set of individual characteristics
included in the vector 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 in order to understand how they affect the results (see Table 4). As described in

the text, we first estimate a standard Cox proportional hazards model using increasingly large sets of
characteristics. The most detailed model that does not use machine learning includes age, sex, and indicators
for 27 chronic conditions. We then turn to a specification that incorporates information from 1,062
variables. Including so many control variables creates two challenges. First, some variables may be
significant predictors of survival for the 2002 cohort just by chance, even if they are not good predictors of
survival in general. This may cause bias due to overfitting (Harrell, Lee, and Mark 1996). Second,

6

computational limitations prevent us from including a large set of regressors when performing conventional
maximum likelihood estimation on a large sample using standard numerical procedures.
We overcome these challenges by estimating a Cox-Lasso model (Tibshirani 1997). Cox-Lasso can
be implemented by maximizing a penalized version of objective function (A2):
ln 𝐿𝐿(𝛽𝛽) =

𝑁𝑁

where |𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 | is the absolute value of 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 , the 𝑖𝑖th element of the vector 𝛽𝛽, and 𝑘𝑘 is the number of included

regressors. We select the optimal penalty parameter λ using five-fold cross validation. 8 We include the
following 1,062 regressors (not including omitted categories) when estimating this survival model 9:
1. Age in days as of January 1, 2002
2. Indicator variables for sex and for seven different races
3. Indicator variables for the presence of the following 27 different chronic conditions as of December
31, 2001: acute myocardial infarction, Alzheimer’s disease, senile dementia, atrial fibrillation,
cataracts, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure,
diabetes, glaucoma, hip/pelvic fracture, ischemic heart disease, depression, osteoporosis,
rheumatoid arthritis, stroke, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer,
endometrial cancer, anemia, asthma, hyperlipidemia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, hypertension,
and hypothyroidism
a. Indicator variables for all pairwise interactions of these 27 chronic conditions
4. Indicator variables for the interaction of 27 chronic conditions with seven race indicators
5. Indicator variables for the interaction of 27 chronic conditions with sex
6. Indicator variables for 12 percentiles (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 99, 99.9) of the
beneficiary’s prior year spending (i.e., spending that excludes payments made by Medicare)
a. Indicator variables for the same 12 quantiles for each of the following 17 different
categories of total (beneficiary plus Medicare) prior year medical spending: hospice, home

other procedures, imaging, tests, durable medical equipment, other Part B carrier, and Part
B physician

outpatient emergency room visits, tests events, Part B physician events (10, 30, 50, 70, 90,
99, 99.5)
8. Fourth-order polynomials in each of 37 different variables that have been merged to the
respondent’s five-digit ZIP code of residence. All variables are standardized so that they follow a
normal distribution with mean zero and variance one. These ZIP code-level data are obtained from
the 2007–2011 and 2008–2012 American Community Surveys. The variables include data on the
following categories (number of variables in parentheses if more than one): travel time to work (2),
fraction below the poverty line (3), median household income, aggregate household income,
aggregate household social security income, aggregate household retirement income, fraction in
labor force, heating fuel sources (3), aggregate number of vehicles, median home value, fraction
immigrant, Gini index of household income, fraction with less than high school education, median
year housing built, fraction on disability (2), fraction with hearing difficulties (2), fractions with
vision difficulty (2), fraction with cognitive difficulty (2), fraction with ambulatory difficulty (2),
fraction with self-care difficulty (2), fraction with independent-living difficulty (2), fraction with
any health coverage (2), and fraction with private health coverage (2).
The estimated life expectancy that forms the basis of the estimate in Column (6) of Table 4 is based on
estimating equation (A4) when including the 1,062 regressors listed above.
The dashed lines in Online Appendix Figure A5 show the distribution of estimated life expectancies
for the subsample of Medicare beneficiaries used to estimate our survival model. The range of the
distribution is wider when the model includes all 1,062 predictors (the dashed black line) than when it
includes only age and sex as predictors (the dashed red line). The model based on age and sex corresponds
to a typical life table that includes only 68 (= (100 − 67 + 1) × 2) values. (The maximum and minimum

values in this life table correspond to life expectancies for a 67-year-old female and a 100-year-old male,

respectively.) By contrast, the Cox-Lasso model generates a much larger set of predictions, some of which
lie outside the range of a basic age-sex life table.

8

The solid lines in Online Appendix Figure A5 show how the distribution of predicted values
changes when it is limited to the subset of beneficiaries who died during the 2002 calendar year. The
distribution produced by the model that includes only age and sex—given by the solid red line—shifts to
the left because these decedents are older than the average Medicare beneficiary and thus have belowaverage life expectancies. The distribution for the Cox-Lasso model—given by the solid black line—shifts
to the left even more. This indicates that beneficiaries who died within one year of January 1, 2002 were
not only older than the average beneficiary in that year, but also they were less healthy than average, as
captured by variables like prior medical spending and prior chronic conditions. Accounting for these
additional variables reduces (on average) the predicted life expectancies for these Medicare beneficiaries.
This demonstrates that the Cox-Lasso model that incorporates data from many variables generates
predictions that are more accurate than a simple Cox model that accounts only for age and sex.
To further validate these estimates, we perform a similar exercise that incorporates Medicare data
from individuals not included in our estimation sample. We first use the estimates from our model to predict
life expectancy for Medicare beneficiaries as of January 1 of each calendar year. For each of these years,
we then calculate the average life expectancy for all fee-for-service beneficiaries who die during that year
(“decedents”). We focus on this group because these decedents form the basis of the life-years lost estimates
reported in Table 4.
Online Appendix Figure A6 displays the results of this exercise. The solid orange line, which serves
as a baseline, displays our estimate of the unconditional life expectancy (11.4 years) for all Medicare
beneficiaries. The solid green line displays life expectancy among “decedents,” as predicted by a Cox
proportional hazards model that conditions on age and sex. Because the typical decedent is older than the
average beneficiary, the predictions from this model are about 3.5 years lower than the baseline. This is
clearly a more accurate prediction, since these decedents by definition died within one year of when their
life expectancy was estimated. For the sake of comparison, we also include predictions based on a period
life table published by the Social Security Administration (SSA). The SSA life table conditions on age and
sex, and its predictions are nearly identical to those of our Cox model estimated using age and sex. The
solid black line displays estimates based on the Cox-Lasso estimation of the Cox proportional hazards
model with 1,062 regressors. This reduces the prediction by yet another three years. The estimates decline
slightly over time, which likely reflects the improvement in the recording of chronic conditions in later
years. 10

Overall rates of chronic conditions captured in the Medicare data increase systematically each year from 1999 (the
first year Medicare measured these conditions) to 2006. Because some chronic conditions are not treated regularly
(and thus not diagnosed), these trends likely reflect incomplete measurement. Because beneficiaries in these earlier

C.2 Survival random forest

Random forest is a non-parametric, nonlinear method that predicts an outcome based on a set of

inputs (Breiman 2001). The basic unit of a random forest is a decision tree. Decision trees sequentially split
the predictor space into a number of simple regions. The predicted outcome for a given observation is
typically the mean outcome among training observations that lie in the same predictor region.
A decision tree is grown using recursive binary splitting of the prediction space using a set of
training observations. To begin, all training observations are contained in a single node. At each step of the
recursive process, terminal nodes from the prior step are split by selecting the predictor and cut point that
minimizes in-sample prediction error (e.g., residual sum of squares) of the resulting tree. Recursive binary
splitting continues until a stopping rule is reached, resulting in a set of terminal nodes that each contain at
least one observation. When there are a large number of variables, each with a large number of possible
values, the decision tree can become very large.
While decision trees are simple and easy to interpret, they often have poor prediction accuracy.
Random forest employs bootstrapping to generate many decision trees. The random forest prediction for an
observation is calculated as the average prediction across all trees in the forest. The consensus prediction
of a random forest can be much more accurate than the prediction from a single decision tree.
Ishwaran et al. (2008) extend random forest to cover right-censored survival data. We estimate a
survival random forest model using the following algorithm (Ishwaran and Kogalur 2007):
1. For 𝑏𝑏 = 1 to B trees:

A. Draw a bootstrap sample of size 𝑁𝑁, where 𝑁𝑁 is the number of observations in the
dataset.

B. Grow a decision tree until a minimum node size of 𝑠𝑠 is reached, where minimum node
size is defined as the number of deaths in that node.

i. Select 𝑚𝑚 = √𝑘𝑘 variables at random, where 𝑘𝑘 is the number of variables in the
dataset.

ii. Find the best split point among those 𝑚𝑚 variables.

a. The number of potential split points depends on the number of unique
values realized by these 𝑚𝑚 variables. For example, a binary variable
like sex has one potential split point.

years are less likely to have their chronic conditions recorded in the data, their estimated life expectancy is higher than
beneficiaries in later years, who are more likely to have recorded chronic conditions.

10

1) For each variable, limit the set of unique values to a random
sample of 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 values. For example, if total spending has

1,000 different possible values and 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 = 10, then a
random sample of 10 spending values will be considered as
potential split points.

b. The best split point is defined as the one that maximizes the value of
the log-rank test statistic.
iii. Split the node into two daughter nodes, and then continue splitting subject to
the constraint that a terminal node should not have less than 𝑠𝑠 deaths.

2. Calculate the cumulative hazard function for each terminal node of each tree. Then, generate
the prediction by averaging over all 𝐵𝐵 trees.

�𝑏𝑏 (𝑡𝑡) is equal to the number of deaths in node 𝑖𝑖 of
A. The cumulative hazard function, 𝐻𝐻
𝑖𝑖
tree 𝑏𝑏 at time 𝑡𝑡 divided by the number of people at risk in that node at time 𝑡𝑡.

B. Let 𝑰𝑰[𝑗𝑗 ∈ node 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖 ] be an indicator function equal to 1 if individual 𝑖𝑖 is a member of
terminal node 𝑗𝑗 in decision tree 𝑏𝑏 and 0 otherwise. The predicted cumulative hazard

for individual 𝑖𝑖 is then obtained by averaging over all the terminal nodes in which she
resides:

𝐵𝐵

�𝑏𝑏 (𝑡𝑡)
� (𝑡𝑡|𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 ) = � � 𝑰𝑰�𝑖𝑖 ∈ node 𝑏𝑏𝑗𝑗 �𝐻𝐻
𝐻𝐻
𝑗𝑗
𝐵𝐵
𝑏𝑏=1 𝑗𝑗

� (𝑡𝑡|𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 ), as
The survival function, 𝑆𝑆̂(𝑡𝑡|𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 ), can then be derived from the cumulative hazard function, 𝐻𝐻

described above. In our analysis, we set the number of trees 𝐵𝐵 equal to 250, the minimum node size 𝑠𝑠 equal

to 3, and 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 equal to 10. As with the Cox proportional hazards model, the survival predictions are
limited to the 12 years (2002–2013) for which we observe the 2002 Medicare cohort, so we again

extrapolate the survival function to future years by assuming it follows a log-linear form.

We estimate our Survival Random Forest model at the monthly level using the same predictors as
the Cox-Lasso model described above (age, sex, race, chronic conditions, medical spending, and ZIP-codelevel demographics). Because Survival Random Forest inherently accounts for interactions and nonlinear
effects, it requires fewer input variables (124) than Cox-Lasso (1,062). For example, we do not need to
create indicator variables for different quantiles of spending, nor do we need to create pairwise interactions.
The dotted blue line in Online Appendix Figure A6 compares life expectancy estimates from
Survival Random Forest to estimates from different Cox proportional hazards models. Unsurprisingly,
Survival Random Forest using all available data performs significantly better than a Cox model that

11

includes only age and sex as predictors. However, it performs slightly worse than the Cox-Lasso model that
also employs all available data.

D. Using machine learning to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects
Online Appendix Section D.1 describes the method developed by Chernozhukov, Demirer, Duflo, and
Fernandez-Val (2018) (hereafter CDDF), as outlined in their paper. Online Appendix Section D.2 describes
challenges in applying this method to our setting, and explains how we address these challenges.

D.1 Chernozhukov, Demirer, Duflo, and Fernandez-Val (2018)
CDDF develop a method for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in randomized experiments that is
valid even in high-dimensional settings. The setting outlined in their paper is as follows. Let 𝑌𝑌 be the

outcome of interest and 𝑍𝑍 be a vector of covariates. Units are randomly assigned to either a treatment group

(𝑇𝑇 = 1) or a control group (𝑇𝑇 = 0). The probability of assignment to treatment is given by the propensity
score, 𝑝𝑝(𝑍𝑍). Treatment effect heterogeneity is measured using the conditional average treatment effect
function:

𝑠𝑠0 (𝑍𝑍) = 𝐸𝐸[𝑌𝑌|𝑇𝑇 = 1, 𝑍𝑍] − 𝐸𝐸[𝑌𝑌|𝑇𝑇 = 0, 𝑍𝑍]

CDDF propose the following steps to study properties of 𝑠𝑠0 (𝑍𝑍):

1. Split the sample into two approximately equal parts: a “main” and an “auxiliary” sample.
2. Use the auxiliary sample to train a machine learning (ML) algorithm (e.g., Lasso, Random Forest)
to predict 𝑌𝑌 using 𝑍𝑍. This prediction exercise is performed twice: once using only control group
observations, and once using only treatment group observations.

3. Predict 𝑌𝑌 for observations in the main sample using both prediction models from step 2. That is,

for each observation in the main sample, predict 𝑌𝑌 using estimates obtained from training the ML

𝑇𝑇=1 ), and predict outcomes using estimates obtained from
algorithm on the treated observations (𝑌𝑌�

The proxy predictor 𝑆𝑆̂(𝑍𝑍) is a possibly biased and inconsistent estimate of the conditional average treatment

effect function, 𝑠𝑠0 (𝑍𝑍). Nevertheless, CDDF show that the researcher can still use 𝑆𝑆̂(𝑍𝑍) to extract important

properties of 𝑠𝑠0 (𝑍𝑍). First, the researcher can identify 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑃𝑃�𝑠𝑠0 (𝑍𝑍)|𝑆𝑆̂(𝑍𝑍)�, the best linear predictor of 𝑠𝑠0 (𝑍𝑍)
using 𝑆𝑆(𝑍𝑍), by estimating the following weighted regression:

12

𝑌𝑌 = 𝛽𝛽1 �𝑇𝑇 − 𝑝𝑝(𝑍𝑍)� + 𝛽𝛽2 �𝑇𝑇 − 𝑝𝑝(𝑍𝑍)� �𝑆𝑆̂(𝑍𝑍) − 𝑆𝑆̂� + 𝜃𝜃′𝑋𝑋1 + 𝜀𝜀,

(A5)

where the weights are equal to

𝑤𝑤(𝑍𝑍) =

1

.
𝑝𝑝(𝑍𝑍)�1 − 𝑝𝑝(𝑍𝑍)�

𝑇𝑇=0
The control variables 𝑋𝑋1 can include the baseline outcome prediction, 𝑌𝑌�
, as well as a constant term. 11
𝚤𝚤

The variable 𝑝𝑝(𝑍𝑍) is the probability of treatment as a function of 𝑍𝑍, i.e., the propensity score, which CDDF

assume is known. Equation (A5) identifies the best linear predictor in the sense that 𝛽𝛽1 = 𝐸𝐸(𝑠𝑠0 (𝑍𝑍)) and

𝛽𝛽2 = 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑠𝑠0 (𝑍𝑍), 𝑆𝑆̂(𝑍𝑍))/𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉(𝑆𝑆̂(𝑍𝑍)). Testing whether 𝛽𝛽2 = 0 corresponds to testing the joint null
hypothesis of no heterogeneous treatment effects and irrelevance of the proxy predictor. In addition, CDDF

suggest an alternative specification that employs the Horvitz-Thompson transformation:
𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌 = 𝛽𝛽1 + 𝛽𝛽2 �𝑆𝑆̂(𝑍𝑍) − 𝑆𝑆̂� + 𝜃𝜃𝐻𝐻 ′𝑋𝑋1 𝐻𝐻 + 𝜖𝜖

where

𝐻𝐻 =

(A6)

𝑇𝑇 − 𝑝𝑝(𝑍𝑍)

.
𝑝𝑝(𝑍𝑍)�1 − 𝑝𝑝(𝑍𝑍)�

Next, CDDF show how to obtain “sorted group average treatment effects.” First, the researcher
partitions the sample into 𝐾𝐾 groups, 𝐺𝐺1 , 𝐺𝐺2 , … , 𝐺𝐺𝐾𝐾 , according to non-overlapping intervals of the proxy
predictor, 𝑆𝑆̂(𝑍𝑍). To obtain the sorted effects, the researcher estimates the following weighted regression:
𝐾𝐾

𝑌𝑌 = 𝛼𝛼 ′ 𝑋𝑋1 + � 𝛾𝛾𝑘𝑘 �𝑇𝑇 − 𝑝𝑝(𝑍𝑍)� ∙ 1(𝐺𝐺𝑘𝑘 ) + 𝜖𝜖,

(A7)

𝑘𝑘=1

where 1(𝐺𝐺𝑘𝑘 ) is an indicator for belonging to group 𝑘𝑘 and the weights, 𝑤𝑤(𝑍𝑍), are the same ones used to

estimate the best linear predictor of 𝑠𝑠0 (𝑍𝑍). CDDF show that the estimated coefficient 𝛾𝛾�𝑘𝑘 captures the

average treatment effect in group 𝑘𝑘, 𝐸𝐸(𝑠𝑠0 (𝑍𝑍)|𝐺𝐺𝑘𝑘 ) ∀𝑘𝑘. These coefficients can therefore be used to measure

the distribution of treatment effects across these 𝐾𝐾 groups.

Finally, CDDF also show that the average characteristics of units assigned to one of the 𝐾𝐾 groups

described above can be obtained by simply computing the mean. The researcher can then estimate
differences in characteristics across these groups by comparing their means.

regressions.

13

The estimated parameters above, such as 𝛾𝛾�𝑘𝑘 , are subject to two forms of uncertainty: sample

splitting uncertainty from step 1 and standard estimation uncertainty. CDDF show that under sufficient
regularity conditions the estimated parameters are normally distributed, conditional on the sample split in
step 1. They therefore propose that the researcher repeat steps 1–4 and re-estimate equations (A5)–(A7)
100 times and then report the median of those 100 estimates, along with the medians of the 100 lower and
upper bounds of the corresponding confidence intervals.
An appealing feature of CDDF is that the researcher can employ any ML algorithm when
performing predictions. We use gradient boosted decision trees, as implemented by Chen and Guestrin
(2016). Prior work has shown this algorithm to be a good predictor of mortality in the Medicare population
(Einav et al. 2018). Our implementation allows for 500 boosting iterations and a maximum tree depth of
10.

D.2 Using CDDF to estimate mortality heterogeneity in a large-sample, non-RCT
setting
We conduct our heterogeneity analysis using a person-day sample of beneficiaries who have been
continuously enrolled in FFS for at least two years. Employing a disaggregated version of our county-day
sample maximizes the amount of heterogeneity available for our analysis, but also introduces computational
challenges because the disaggregation increases our sample size by a factor of 26,000. To minimize the
computational load, our heterogeneity analysis employs a one-day window for the outcome instead of a
three-day.
The CDDF method was designed for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and thus requires clearly
identified treatment and control groups. By contrast, our quasi-experimental setting has a continuous-valued
endogenous regressor (pollution) and many binary instruments (wind direction bin indicators interacted
with monitor group indicators). In order to apply CDDF to our setting, we assign each county-day
observation in our sample to either a high pollution wind direction (“treatment”) group or low pollution
wind direction (“control”) group as follows. We first estimate equation (A1) separately for each monitor
group, as discussed in Section A of this Online Appendix. We then categorize wind direction bins with
above-median estimated coefficients as “high pollution” directions, and those with below-median
coefficients as “low pollution” directions. This allows us to define a new county-day indicator that is equal
to one if the observed wind direction is associated with high pollution and zero otherwise. Online Appendix
Table A12 reports estimates of the effect of PM 2.5 on one-day mortality using this just-identified IV
specification. The specification presented in column (1), which includes the controls and fixed effects from
our main empirical specification, estimates that a one-unit increase in PM 2.5 increases one-day mortality
by 0.356 per million beneficiaries. For comparison, the corresponding over-identified IV specification

14

estimates a one-day mortality increase of 0.40 (not reported).12 Columns (2)-(5) show how the justidentified estimate varies across different fixed-effect specifications.
Interpreting these estimates requires understanding how PM 2.5 levels differ across observations
assigned to the treatment and control groups. Online Appendix Table A13 reports estimates of the first
stage and the reduced form for a county-day specification estimated using the binary instrument described
above. On average, PM 2.5 levels are 2.4 𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇/𝑚𝑚3 higher for treated county-days than for control county-

days (Panel A, columns (2)-(4)).

Another consequence of our non-RCT setting is that the propensity score is unknown. We therefore

perform step 2 of the CDDF procedure twice: first to estimate mortality, 𝑌𝑌, and second to estimate the

propensity score, 𝑝𝑝(𝑍𝑍). 13 Our analysis ignores the estimation error in the propensity score. This is

reasonable because our sample size is enormous. To avoid overfitting, we do not allow the same people to
appear in the main and auxiliary dataset when performing these two prediction exercises. In other words,
the random assignment of observations to the main and auxiliary files is done at the person level, rather
than the person-day level.
A second challenge we face in our setting is that the probability of an individual dying on any given

day is very small. It is well-known that standard machine learning algorithms perform poorly in such cases
because the algorithm will generally never predict death for anybody, which causes problems during step
2 of the CDDF procedure. We therefore follow Einav et al. (2018) and employ “downsampling” when we
train our machine learning algorithm to predict mortality. Specifically, we sample every person-day in the
auxiliary sample with a death outcome with probability one, and then randomly select the same number of
auxiliary sample person-days with no death outcome, resulting in a perfectly balanced sample. We set aside
10 percent of this sample for calibrating the predicted death probability, as described next, and train the
machine learning models on the remaining 90 percent. 14
Because the death rate in this subsample is exactly 50 percent, the resulting predictions are biased
upward and need to be adjusted. We correct for this bias in the same manner as Einav et al. (2018), using
our calibration dataset and a Bayesian correction formula. First, we use the downsampled model to predict

12
The corresponding over-identified IV estimate using three-day mortality is equal to 0.685 (see column (1) of Table
2 in the main text).

The mortality estimation is performed using downsampled data, as described below. The propensity score estimation
is performed using a random subsample of 24.5 million observations (0.1 percent of the auxiliary sample).

13

There are 1.84 million person-days with a death outcome in the auxiliary control sample, including the 10 percent
used for calibration. There are 2.07 million such person-days in the auxiliary treated sample.
14

15

mortality in the calibration dataset. We then regress the realized mortality rates in this 10 percent balanced
sample on a cubic polynomial of the predicted mortality rates. This regression model is then used to adjust
the mortality predictions for the observations in the main sample. We further adjust those predictions, 𝑌𝑌� ∗ ,
using the following Bayesian correction formula:
𝑌𝑌� =

𝑌𝑌� ∗
𝑅𝑅 − (𝑅𝑅 − 1)𝑌𝑌� ∗

The value 𝑅𝑅 is the ratio of survivors to decedents in the auxiliary sample. Incorporating this adjustment
helps ensure that the final mortality predictions, 𝑌𝑌�, match the mean death rate in the full sample.

A third challenge is that implementing the CDDF methodology is computationally taxing: our

person-day sample reflects over 40 billion person-day observations. 15 We address this challenge as follows.

First, we replace county, state-by-month, and month-by-year fixed effects with month, year, and division
fixed effects. 16 While this requires imposing a stronger identifying assumption, we have verified that sameday mortality estimates with division fixed effects are similar to those with county fixed effects (see Online
Appendix Table A12). Second, we implement the method in parallel on a dedicated server with 1 TB of
memory and 32 processors. Under these conditions, the heterogeneity analysis requires four weeks to run
for a single “split” of the data. Third, we do not repeat the entire analysis 100 times to account for splitting
uncertainty. Instead, we estimate a single regression. This is reasonable because our sample is enormous
(orders of magnitude larger than the sample sizes of the applications in CDDF) and thus is unlikely to
exhibit much splitting uncertainty.
The sample used to estimate the results reported in Table 6 includes over 20 billion observations.
We compute the regressions by partitioning the sample into 250 equally sized pieces and estimating 250
separate regressions. Table 6 reports the average of the 250 point estimates from those regressions. We
calculate standard errors by taking the average of the 250 corresponding standard errors and then dividing
by the square-root of 250. We use the same methodology to estimate equation (6). (The estimates of
equation (6) are reported in Figure 5 and Online Appendix Table A14.)

15
While it is possible to apply the CDDF methodology to county-level rather than person-level data, a county-level
heterogeneity exercise is much less interesting because it necessitates averaging characteristics across all the
beneficiaries in a county, thereby eliminating a lot of relevant variation.

By design, the machine learning algorithm we employ accounts for interactions between fixed effects, so this
alteration is less restrictive than it would be in a regression setting. The nontrivial change is the removal of state and
county fixed effects. However, even in a regression setting this removal does not appear to matter much (see Online
Appendix Table A12).

16

16

We perform the following permutation test to confirm that we are not understating the magnitude
of our standard errors. For each of our 250 partitions, we randomly permute the outcome variable 100 times
and estimate 100 new regressions. We then calculate an average point estimate for each permutation. This
generates placebo distributions for 𝛽𝛽1 and 𝛽𝛽2 that are centered around zero. The estimates of 𝛽𝛽1 and 𝛽𝛽2

reported in column (1) of Table 6 are larger than all 100 of these placebo estimates, providing further

evidence that our estimates are statistically significant.

E. Potential for bias in estimating life-years lost
We propose a new methodology that applies machine learning to estimate life-years lost and is less prone
to bias than previous methods. In this Appendix, we present a framework illustrating why the traditional
method of estimating life-years lost is likely to produce upwardly biased estimates. We highlight an
additional assumption required to eliminate this bias and explain how our approach is more likely to meet
this assumption than prior approaches. This conceptual framework motivates the data and methods we use
in the main text to estimate life-years lost to fine particulate matter.
Our empirical model includes observations for individual i for all periods t up to and including the
period of the individual’s death. Let 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 > 0 be the expected number of remaining life-years for individual

𝑖𝑖 in period 𝑡𝑡 if she does not die at time t. For simplicity, we assume that 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is unaffected by pollution. 17 Let
𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 be an indicator equal to one if individual i dies in period 𝑡𝑡 and equal to zero otherwise. Then 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

is the number of life-years lost due to the death of this individual in period 𝑡𝑡 so that 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 if the individual
dies in period 𝑡𝑡, and 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 0 if the individual survives past period 𝑡𝑡.

We assume that exposure to PM 2.5 is assigned randomly, which effectively is the case under our

instrumental variables approach. Suppose the relationship between PM 2.5 and life-years lost is governed
by the following model:
𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 PM2.5𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

(A8)

This model recognizes that the effect of PM 2.5 exposure on life-years lost, 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 , can vary across individuals.

The error term 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 represents factors other than pollution that affect mortality. By assumption of random

assignment, these factors are uncorrelated with PM2.5𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

Letting 𝛾𝛾 = 𝐸𝐸(𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 ), we can rewrite equation (A8) as

𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛾𝛾PM2.5𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + (𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 − 𝛾𝛾)PM2.5𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(A9)

17
As in other studies, we focus on estimating the immediate effects of pollution exposure on life-years lost. It is also
possible that exposure reduces an individual’s remaining life expectancy, 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , without killing her during the time
window we focus on. In that case, our life-years lost estimates can be interpreted as lower bounds.

17

= 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛾𝛾PM2.5𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,

where 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = (𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 − 𝛾𝛾)PM2.5𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 . Because PM 2.5 is assigned randomly, if 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is perfectly observable,

the standard identifying assumption 𝐸𝐸[𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃2.5𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ] = 0 holds, and OLS estimation of equation (A9) will

identify 𝐸𝐸[𝛾𝛾�] = 𝐸𝐸(𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝛾𝛾. Thus, the presence of heterogeneous treatment effects does not, by itself, pose
a problem for unbiased estimation of the average treatment effect provided that the treatment is exogenous.

In practice, counterfactual life expectancy, 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , is predicted rather than observed, reintroducing the potential

for biased estimates of the average treatment effect, even when appropriate instruments for the treatment
exist. Let 𝑐𝑐̂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑔𝑔�(𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) be the prediction of remaining life-years for individual i at time t generated by some

model, 𝑔𝑔�, using covariates 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (e.g., age and sex). Let 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = (𝑐𝑐̂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) be the measurement error in this

estimate so that 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 > 0 indicates the model has overestimated the true counterfactual life expectancy. We
assume that the life-expectancy model is correct on average for the population (i.e., that 𝐸𝐸(𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 0). The
estimated number of life-years lost due to death is denoted as 𝐿𝐿�𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑐𝑐̂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 . Thus, 𝐿𝐿�𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 =

(𝑐𝑐̂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 )𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 . Rewriting this as 𝐿𝐿�𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , the analog of equation (3) that the researcher
can estimate with observable data is:

𝐿𝐿�𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 PM2.5𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

= 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛾𝛾PM2.5𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,

(A10)

where 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is unobservable. Unbiased estimation of 𝛾𝛾 in equation (A10) requires that E(𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 +

𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃2.5𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 0. By assumption, E(𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃2.5𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 0, which allows us to simplify this requirement
to E(𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃2.5𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = E(𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃2.5𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 )E(𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃2.5𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) + 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃2.5𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 0. Since 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃2.5𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is

randomly assigned, 𝐸𝐸(𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃2.5𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝐸𝐸(𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 0. Thus, the key requirement for unbiased estimation is

that 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃2.5𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 0. Unfortunately, this condition is unlikely to hold in most research settings.
If death is a function of PM 2.5 exposure, and if unobserved health characteristics (such as latent heart
disease) that make an individual more likely to die from PM 2.5 exposure also lead to overestimation of
that individual’s remaining lifespan (i.e., 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 > 0), then 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃2.5𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) will be positive, not zero.

A natural interpretation of this issue is that it is one of selection bias: less healthy individuals are

more likely to be “selected” into death due to PM 2.5 exposure, even after controlling for observables,
which leads to upward bias in their estimated remaining life expectancy. However, not all unobserved
health-related factors lead to bias in the estimation of 𝛾𝛾. It is only when these unobserved factors also make

the individual more vulnerable to death via PM 2.5 exposure that the estimation error in life expectancy
becomes correlated with the treatment among those who die. In other words, even if the treatment is
randomly assigned, if there is heterogeneity in the propensity to die from PM 2.5 exposure, then death, and
by extension life-years lost, need not be random with respect to individuals’ characteristics. In this sense,
the problem we encounter here is also related to bias that can arise in the case of correlated random

18

coefficients (Heckman and Vytlacil 1998; Wooldridge 2003), although it is more complicated in our case
since there is the intervening step that the effect of the random coefficient operates by affecting who dies.
This correlation may persist even when using valid instrumental variables.
To summarize, unbiased estimation of life-years lost requires modeling life expectancy using the
same factors that make people susceptible to dying from pollution. We address this challenge by harnessing
the comprehensive health and demographic information available in the Medicare dataset to generate
relatively precise predictions of counterfactual life expectancy. In other words, we minimize the magnitude
of the measurement error represented by 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 in equation (A10).

million beneficiaries (Panel A) or per million fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries (Panel B). The sample is restricted to county-days where readings
for carbon monixide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and PM 2.5 are simultaneously available. All regressions include county,
month-by-year, and state-by-month fixed effects; flexible controls for temperatures, precipitation, and wind speed; two leads of the weather
controls; and two leads and lags of the instruments. Estimates are weighted by the number of Medicare beneficiaries in Panel A and by the number
of FFS beneficiaries in Panel B.

Notes: Column (1) presents average treatment effects by heterogeneity group for seven different percentile intervals of Ŝ(Zit ), the proxy predictor
of the conditional average treatment effect. The average treatment effect is defined as the average mortality effect of being exposed to one day of
air when the wind that day is blowing from a direction associated with high air pollution. Column (2) divides these reported estimates by 2.4,
which corresponds to the estimated coefficient on treatment in the first-stage specification reported in columns (2)-(4) of panel A in Table A13.
Thus, column (2) reports the average mortality effect of being exposed to one additional unit (µg/m3 ) of PM 2.5 on one-day mortality. Standard
errors, clustered by county, are reported in parentheses.
