Summary: Abadie et al. (2010) derive bounds on the bias of the synthetic control estimator
under a perfect balance assumption on both observed covariates and pre-treatment outcomes.
In the absence of a perfect balance on covariates, we show that it is still possible to derive
such bounds, albeit at the expense of relying on stronger assumptions about the effects of
observed and unobserved covariates and of generating looser bounds. We also show that a
perfect balance on pre-treatment outcomes does not generally imply an approximate balance
for all covariates, even when they are all relevant. Our results have important implications for
the implementation of the method.

1. INTRODUCTION
Social scientists are often interested in evaluating the effect of a policy or a treatment on an
outcome of interest. To perform such an analysis, it is necessary to construct a counterfactual
outcome for the treated unit for a scenario in which there were no treatment. In the absence
of randomized experiments, however, it is often difficult to find a suitable comparison unit to
construct such a counterfactual. The synthetic control (SC) method, developed in a series of
papers by Abadie et al. (2010), Abadie et al. (2015), and Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003), allows
practitioners to construct a counterfactual outcome for the treated unit from a set of potential
control units. The method uses a data-driven weighted average of the selected control units to
construct a synthetic control unit that is more similar to the treated unit than any of the individual
control units. Since its inception, this method has been used widely in social sciences, becoming
an important part of the toolbox used in the policy evaluation literature (see Athey and Imbens,
2017).
When potential outcomes follow a linear factor model, Abadie et al. (2010) showed that the
existence of weights that achieve a perfect balance for the treated unit on both pre-treatment
outcomes and observed covariates implies that it is possible to obtain bounds on the bias of the
SC estimator that uses those weights to construct the SC unit.1 Such bounds are valid when
1 In this context, a perfect balance on pre-treatment outcomes and covariates means that there is a set of weights such
that, for each of these variables, the value of the treated unit is equal to a weighted average of the control units using
those weights.

2 For example, Doudchenko and Imbens (2016) suggested that, in terms of predictive power, lagged outcomes tend to
be substantially more important than other covariates, which implies that covariates should play, in practice, a relatively
minor role, whereas Gobillon and Magnac (2016) analysed the case in which all pre-treatment outcomes are included as
predictors.
3 Under a perfect balance only in the pre-treatment outcomes, we have to assume that the effects of both observed
and unobserved covariates in the pre-treatment periods are linearly independent, so that it is possible to derive bounds on
the bias of the SC estimator. In contrast, under a perfect balance on both pre-treatment outcomes and covariates, such a
condition is required for the effects of only unobserved covariates.
4 We refer to approximate balance for a covariate as the difference between the covariate for the treated unit and for
the SC unit being bounded by a function that goes to zero with the number of pre-treatment periods.

the number of pre-treatment periods is fixed, and they become smaller as the number of pretreatment periods increases. This result helped popularize the SC method. It showed that the
SC method allows for substantially more flexibility in the treatment assignment mechanism
relative to alternative methods, such as difference in differences, provided that a good balance
in pre-treatment outcomes and observed covariates is achieved. In line with this result, Abadie
et al. (2010, 2015) recommended estimating weights to construct an SC unit that provides a
good balance in terms of both pre-treatment outcomes and observed covariates. Moreover, they
recommended that the SC method be used only if the SC unit provides a good fit in terms of these
variables.
Recent work, however, has placed more emphasis on the importance of matching on pretreatment outcomes rather than on observed covariates.2 This focus seems to be at odds with the
recommendation of Abadie et al. (2010, 2015) to use the SC method only when covariates are
also well balanced. In the present paper, we consider the role that observed covariates play in the
SC method by characterizing the bias properties of the SC estimator without imposing a perfect
balance assumption on observed covariates but maintaining a perfect balance on pre-treatment
outcomes.
Our analysis has two main contributions. Our first contribution is to show that it is still possible
to derive bounds on the bias of the SC estimator when we relax the assumption of perfect balance
in terms of covariates. However, relaxing this assumption comes at some costs. In the absence of a
perfect balance on covariates, we require stronger assumptions about the effects of both observed
and unobserved covariates to derive bounds on the bias of the SC estimator.3 This implies that we
will generally require a larger number of pre-treatment periods to derive such bounds. Moreover,
we show that the bounds obtained in this case are looser than when a perfect balance on covariates
is also imposed, clarifying the role played by the observed covariates in the derivation of bounds
on the bias of the SC estimator.
Our second contribution is to show that, contrary to the accepted intuition in the SC literature, a
perfect balance on pre-treatment outcomes does not necessarily imply that the treated and SC units
are alike in terms of observed and unobserved covariates, even when sufficient conditions to derive
bounds on the bias of the SC estimator are satisfied. This can be the case even for covariates that
are relevant in determining the potential outcomes. This result is somewhat surprising in light
of the argument outlined by Abadie et al. (2015) that matching on pre-intervention outcomes
would control for unobserved factors and for the heterogeneity of the effect of the observed and
unobserved factors on the outcome of interest. The authors intuited that only units that are alike
in terms of both observed and unobserved determinants of the outcome variable would also be
alike in terms of trajectories of the outcome variable over extended periods of time. Although
our results partially support that argument, we show that a perfect balance on lagged outcomes
does not imply an approximate balance for covariates whose effects on the potential outcomes
are multicollinear with the effects of the other observed and unobserved covariates.4 We also

et al. (2016), and Liu (2015). The result derived by Kaul et al. (2018) is valid when all pre-treatment outcomes used in the
‘outer optimization problem’ are also included in the ‘inner optimization problem’ in the estimation procedure proposed
by Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and Abadie et al. (2010). This may not necessarily be the case if we consider the use
of cross-validation, as proposed by Abadie et al. (2015).

show that a perfect balance on lagged outcomes fails to imply an approximate balance on relevant
covariates if the covariates have nonlinear effects on the potential outcomes. Therefore, we show
that it is still possible to derive bounds on the bias of the SC estimator, even when there is no
approximate balance for observed covariates.
Our results have important implications for researchers applying the SC method. First, we
show that the existence of a good balance in terms of both covariates and pre-treatment outcomes
implies tighter bounds on the bias of the SC estimator relative to when a good balance is
achieved in terms of only pre-treatment outcomes. However, it may not always be possible to
have a good balance on both covariates and pre-treatment outcomes, either because there are
no weights that provide a good fit on both or because covariates that are considered relevant in
determining the potential outcomes are not observed. Our results show that, even in these cases,
it may still be possible to bound the bias of the SC estimator. Therefore, a lack of a perfect or
approximate balance on covariates should not necessarily be interpreted as evidence against the
use of the SC method, as long as there is a good balance in terms of lagged outcomes over an
extended period of time before the treatment. An important caveat, however, is that these results
rely on stronger assumptions about the effects of observed and unobserved covariates than the
assumptions considered by Abadie et al. (2010).
Second, our results provide new insights on the trade-offs involved in the choice of predictors
in the implementation of the SC estimator. A common practice in the implementation of the SC
method is to include all pre-treatment outcomes as predictors, which, as explained by Kaul et al.
(2018), implies that the optimization method used to estimate the SC weights will render irrelevant
all other covariates used as predictors.5 On the one hand, our results show that the bias of the SC
estimator is still bounded when we have good balance on pre-treatment outcomes, even if relevant
covariates are imbalanced. Therefore, an estimation procedure that does not directly attempt to
match on the covariates is not necessarily problematic, even when covariates are relevant in
determining the potential outcomes. On the other hand, achieving a good balance in terms of
covariates has the advantage of providing tighter bounds, so using information from covariates to
construct weights that provide a better balance in terms of covariates may be warranted. In this
case, given that we also show that there are instances in which balance on pre-treatment outcomes
does not imply approximate balance on covariates, our results also highlight the importance of
using a data-driven procedure to determine the relative importance of each predictor used in the
estimation procedure. This guarantees that only covariates that should be balanced are considered
in the estimation method.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we set up the model and
briefly review the results of Abadie et al. (2010). In Section 3, we present the new results. In
Section 4, we discuss the implications of our results for the implementation of the SC method. In
Section 5, we illustrate our results by revisiting the application studied by Abadie et al. (2015).
Section 6 concludes. All proofs are in the Appendix.

2. BASELINE SYNTHETIC CONTROL MODEL
Let Yit (1) and Yit (0) be potential outcomes in the presence and in the absence of a treatment,
respectively, for unit i at time t. Consider the model:

Yit (0) = δt + θt Zi + λt μi + εit
,
(2.1)
Yit (1) = αit + Yit (0)

Yit = Dit Yit (1) + (1 − Dit )Yit (0),

(2.2)

where Dit = 1 if unit i is treated at time t.
Suppose that only unit 1 is treated and that we observe the outcomes of the treated unit and of
J control units for T0 pre-intervention periods and for T1 post-intervention periods. We label the
time periods as −T0 + 1, ..., 0, 1, ..., T1 . Therefore, we have that Dit = 1 if i = 1 and t > 0, and
Dit = 0 otherwise.
The main goal of the SC method is to estimate the treatment effect for unit 1 at each time t >
0—that is, α 1t .7 Because Y1t (0) for t > 0 is not observed, the main idea of the SC method is to
consider a weighted average of the control units to construct a proxy for this counterfactual. That
is, for a given set of weights,
w ∈ {(w2 , ..., wJ +1 )|

we consider an estimator of the form

where δ t is an unknown common factor with constant factor loadings across units; λt is a (1 ×
F) vector of common factors; μi is a (F × 1) vector of unknown factor loadings; θ t is a (1 ×
r) vector of unknown parameter; Zi is a (r × 1) vector of observed covariates (not affected by
the intervention), and the error terms εit are unobserved transitory shocks.6 As in Abadie et al.
(2010), we treat θ t and λt as parameters. We say that a covariate Zki , for 1 ≤ k ≤ r, is relevant if
its associated coefficient θkt = 0 for some t, and we refer to μi as an unobserved covariate. The

3. THE ROLE OF COVARIATES IN THE SYNTHETIC CONTROL METHOD
We first derive conditions under which it is still possible to derive bounds on the bias of the SC
estimator when (2.4) is assumed but (2.5) is not. We also derive conditions under which assuming
(2.4) implies that (2.5) holds approximately. The main idea of our proof is to treat observed
covariates (Zi ) as factor loadings and their associated time-varying effects (θ t ) as common factors.
Consider the following assumptions with regard to the transitory shocks, which are similar to
those considered by Abadie et al. (2010).
3.1. (a) εit are i.n.i.d; (b) E[εit |Zi , μi ] = 0; (c) for some even integer p ≥ 2,
A SSUMPTION


E |εit |p < ∞, for all t = −T0 + 1, ..., 0 and i = 2, ..., J + 1.
We define the 1 × (r + F) row vector γ t ≡ (θ t , λt ), which is the vector of the effects of
observed and unobserved covariates
on the potential outcomes. Additionally, we denote by ξ (T0 )

the smallest eigenvalue of T10 0t=−T0 +1 γt γt .
A SSUMPTION 3.2. ξ (T0 ) > 0.
ξ (T0 ) is a measure of the degree of linear independence of the effects of observed and unobserved covariates in the T0 pre-treatment periods. If, for example, T0 < r + F, then the effects of
observed and unobserved covariates in the T0 pre-treatment periods must be multicollinear, and
ξ (T0 ) = 0. Assumption 3.2 implies that the effects of observed and unobserved covariates in the
T0 pre-treatment periods are linearly independent.

∗
is bounded by a function that
Under additional assumptions, they showed that the bias of α̂1t
depends on T0 and on the scale of the transitory shocks (defined in (3.1) below), such that this
function goes to zero as T0 increases.8 As discussed by Abadie et al. (2010), the interpretation
of this result is that the bias of the SC estimator is small when T0 is large relative to the scale of
the transitory shocks. The main intuition for this result is that conditions (2.4)
and (2.5) can be
satisfied for a long set of pre-treatment periods only if we also have that μ1 ≈ j =1 wj∗ μj . This
result relies on the assumption of perfect balance in terms of lagged outcomes and covariates, so it
should be thought of as a property of the SC estimator using w∗ , conditional on a realization of the
data satisfying the conditions for existence of w∗ . This is an important result because it justifies,
in a linear factor model setting, the procedure suggested in the original SC papers to estimate
the SC weights by choosing weights that minimize the distance between the treated and the SC
units in terms of pre-treatment outcomes and observed covariates. Although conditions (2.4) and
(2.5) are generally not exactly satisfied for a given realization of the data, these results should
be considered a good approximation when these conditions are approximately valid.9 Indeed,
Abadie et al. (2010, 2015) argued that the method should not be used if there is a poor balance in
terms of pre-treatment outcomes and/or covariates.

Proof 1. We provide the proof of Proposition 3.1 in Appendix A.1.

Proposition 3.1 shows that, when the effects of observed and unobserved covariates in the
T0 pre-treatment periods are linearly independent (Assumption 3.2), then a perfect balance in
terms of pre-treatment outcomes implies that we can bound the degree of imbalance in terms of
observed and unobserved covariates, which also makes it possible to derive bounds on the bias
of the SC estimator. The bound on the bias of the SC estimator is increasing with the scale of
the transitory shocks and decreasing with T0 and with ξ (T0 ). In particular, when ξ (T0 ) = 0, the
effects of the covariates in the pre-treatment periods would be multicollinear, and it would not
be possible to derive bounds on the imbalance of observed and unobserved covariates under a
perfect balance on pre-treatment outcomes. Therefore, a necessary condition for Assumption 3.2
is that T0 ≥ r + F. We show below that it is still possible to derive bounds on the bias of the SC
estimator when we relax Assumption 3.2.
If m̄p (T0 ) and γ̄ (T0 ) are bounded, and there are positive constants ξ and T̄ , such that ξ (T0 ) ≥ ξ
for all T0 > T̄ , then the function that bounds the bias of the SC estimator goes to zero as T0
increases.10 The intuition of this result is that, when observed and unobserved covariates have
linearly independent effects on the potential outcomes, then it would be possible to have a good
balance in terms of pre-treatment outcomes for a long set of pre-treatment periods only if we
also have a good balance in terms of observed and unobserved covariates. Although, under these
Those are sufficient, but not necessary, conditions so that the bounds asymptote to zero with T0 → ∞. If, for
1/2
example, m̄p (T0 ) is unbounded, but it increases at a rate lower than T0 , then the bounds would still asymptote to zero.

conditions, the bias of the SC estimator would go to zero when T0 → ∞, note that the bounds
derived in Proposition 3.1 are valid for finite T0 . As in Abadie et al. (2010), result (3.2)hould be
understood as the bias of the SC estimator being small when T0 is large relative to the scale of
the transitory shocks.
Although Proposition 3.1 shows that it is still possible to derive bounds on the bias of the SC
estimator even when (2.5) is not assumed, it comes at a cost of requiring stronger conditions on
the effects of observed and unobserved covariates than those required for the bounds derived by
Abadie et al. (2010), who assumed both (2.4) and (2.5). When both (2.4) and (2.5) are assumed,
then
Assumption 3.2 can be replaced by ξ̇ (T0 ) > 0, where ξ̇ (T0 ) is the smallest eigenvalue of
1 0
t=−T0 +1 λt λt . Because λt is a subvector of γ t , ξ (T0 ) > 0 implies that ξ̇ (T0 ) > 0. However, the
T0
converse may not be true. Therefore, in some settings, it may be possible to construct bounds on
the basis of (2.4) and (2.5), whereas it would not be possible to construct bounds in the absence of
(2.5). In particular, although a necessary condition for ξ (T0 ) > 0 is that T0 ≥ r + F, a necessary
condition for ξ̇ (T0 ) > 0 is that T0 ≥ F. Therefore, in general, we require a larger T0 to derive
bounds on the bias of the SC estimator when (2.5) is relaxed.
For a given T0 , we also have that the bounds assuming both (2.4) and (2.5) are tighter than those
assuming only (2.4).11 The intuition is that assuming (2.5) eliminates the bias due to imbalance
in observed covariates. Also, assuming both (2.4) and (2.5) provides tighter bounds on the degree
of imbalance in terms of unobserved covariates relative to when only (2.4) is assumed, providing
another reason why the bound on the bias of the SC estimator is tighter in this case. Therefore,
although Proposition 3.1 shows that perfect balance in terms of covariates is not a necessary
condition to derive bounds on the bias of the SC estimator, our results also highlight potential
advantages of using covariates, one of which is that the bounds on the bias are tighter. Given this,
we do not intend to argue that practitioners should not directly attempt to match on covariates.
In fact, weights that satisfy both (2.4) and (2.5) should be preferred to weights that satisfy only
(2.4), not only because this obtains tighter bounds on the bias, but also because it circumvents
imposing stronger assumptions for the existence of bounds on the bias of the SC estimator.
The importance of considering the properties of the SC estimator when a perfect balance in
terms of covariates is not assumed comes from the fact that, in empirical applications, covariates
that are thought to be relevant in determining the potential outcomes may not all be observed.
Moreover, even if all relevant covariates are observed, there may not be weights that provide a
good balance in terms of both pre-treatment outcomes and such covariates. Proposition 3.1 shows
that, when potential outcomes are given by (2.1) and observed and unobserved covariates have
linearly independent effects on the potential outcomes, then an approximate balance on observed
covariates follows when there is a perfect balance on pre-treatment outcomes. However, we now
show different settings in which it is possible to derive bounds on the basis of a perfect balance in
pre-treatment outcomes, even when there is no approximate balance on observed covariates. This
can be the case when covariates are irrelevant in determining the potential outcomes, when the
effects of observed and unobserved covariates are multicollinear, or when observed covariates
have nonlinear effects on the potential outcomes. We discuss each case below.
We consider first the case in which some covariates are irrelevant or have effects that are
multicollinear with the effects of other observed and unobserved covariates. That is, we allow for
γt b = 0 for all t for some b ∈ Rr+F \{0}.12 If we were considering a setting with only unobserved
covariates, then we would always be able to redefine the unobserved covariates so that we had

Yit (0) = δt + γ̃t X̃i + εit ,

(3.4)

where the first r̃ components of X̃i are equal to Z̃
i .
Assuming that the smallest eigenvalue of T10 0t=−T0 +1 γ̃t γ̃t is greater than zero allows us to
apply Proposition 3.1 to the rewritten model (3.4). Therefore, bounds on the bias of the SC
estimator can be achieved under weaker conditions than those stated in Proposition 3.1. However,
in this case, Proposition 3.1 guarantees an approximate balance only for the components of X̃i , so
it is not possible to guarantee an approximate balance for all observed covariates if r > r̃. There
are two reasons for this. First, some covariates may be irrelevant in determining the potential
outcomes. In that case, it is clear that a perfect balance on pre-treatment outcomes may be
achieved even in the presence of imbalance in such covariates. More interestingly, there may be
imbalance even for covariates that are relevant. For example, imagine that there is a time-invariant
common factor λ1t = 1, with associated factor loading μ1i , and a covariate Z1i with time-invariant
effects θ 1t = θ 1 . In this case, we would guarantee an approximate balance for (μ1i + Z1i θ 1 ),
but we would not be able to guarantee an approximate balance for μ1i and for Z1i separately.
Intuitively, this multicollinearity implies that there would be weighted averages of the control
units that may provide a good balance for the treated unit in terms of pre-treatment outcomes
even if there is imbalance in relevant observed covariates. In other words, if we consider model
(2.1), then we are able to guarantee approximate balance only for covariates whose effects are
linearly independent of the effects of other observed and unobserved covariates. In this setting,
our previous results indicating that we need stronger assumptions to derive bounds on the bias
of the SC estimator, and that the bounds are looser when a perfect balance on covariates is not
assumed, are still valid.13
Another setting in which perfect balance in terms of pre-treatment outcomes may not imply
approximate balance in terms of covariates is when Zi enters nonlinearly into the potential
outcomes equation. In this case, it may be possible to derive bounds on the bias of the SC
estimator without an approximate balance on covariates, even when the effects of covariates
are not multicollinear. Suppose, for example, that Yit (0) = δ t + θ t g(Zi ) + λt μi + εit . Then,
if ξ (T0 ) > 0, a perfect balance on pre-treatment outcomes would imply bounds on the bias of

If the smallest eigenvalue of T10 0t=−T0 +1 γ̃t γ̃t is greater than zero, then ξ̇ (T0 ) > 0. Therefore, in this case, the
sufficient conditions that allow us to derive the bounds on the bias of the SC estimator when (2.5) is not assumed are
still stronger thanthe sufficient conditions when (2.5) is assumed. In this case, a necessary condition for the smallest

an observationally equivalent model with no irrelevant covariates, and such that the effects of the
covariates were linearly independent. However, this is not the case if we have observed covariates.
Let 1 ≤
d ≤ r + F be the dimension of the space {b ∈ Rr+F \{0}|γt b = 0 ∀ t}. Therefore, for any

T0 , T0 t=−T0 +1 γt γt has at least d eigenvalues equal to zero, so ξ (T0 ) = 0, and it is not possible
to directly apply Proposition 3.1.
Without loss of generality, suppose that the first r̃ observed covariates are relevant and have
effects that are not multicollinear with the effects of other observed and unobserved covariates.
Let θ̃t be a 1 × r̃ vector with the first r̃ components of θ t , and let Z̃i be an r̃ × 1 vector with
the first r̃ components of Zi . Also, let ã be the dimension of the complement of the space
r components
{b ∈ Rr+F \{0}|γt b = 0 ∀ t}. Then we can always find a 1 × ã vector γ̃t with first 
equal to θ̃t , such that, for any b ∈ Rr+F , there will be a b̃ ∈ Rã , such that γt b = γ̃t b̃ for all t.
Moreover, the first 
r components of b are the same as the first 
r components of b̃. Therefore, for
any Xi = (Zi , μi ) , we can find an ã × 1 vector X̃i , such that model (2.1) can be rewritten as

4. IMPLICATIONS FOR ESTIMATION OF THE SC WEIGHTS
Given a realization of the data, in general, there will not be weights that perfectly satisfy conditions (2.3), (2.4), and (2.5). Therefore, the original SC papers suggested an optimization procedure
to estimate the SC weights, aiming at satisfying these conditions as closely as possible. They
defined a set of K predictors, where X1 is a (K × 1) vector containing the predictors for the treated
unit, and X0 is a (K × J) matrix of predictors for the control units. Predictors can be, for example,
linear combinations of pre-intervention values of the outcome variable
and observed covariates.
+1
wj = 1 and wj ≥ 0,
The SC weights are estimated by minimizing ||X1 − X0 w||V subject to Ji=2
where V is a (K × K) positive semidefinite matrix. Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and Abadie
et al. (2010) discussed different possibilities for choosing the matrix V, including a data-driven
process in which V is chosen such that the solution to the ||X1 − X0 w||V optimization problem
minimizes the pre-intervention squared prediction error.
If there is a w∗ such that conditions (2.3), (2.4), and (2.5) are satisfied, then w∗ would trivially
be a solution to this optimization problem.14 Therefore, because the theoretical results presented
by Abadie et al. (2010) rely on the existence of such a w∗ , these results are not directly derived
from the optimization procedure suggested to estimate the SC weights. Rather, these results
provide a theoretical justification for estimation methods that aim to achieve a good balance in
terms of pre-treatment outcomes and covariates. The idea is that, if a close-to-perfect balance is
achieved (that is, conditions (2.3) and (2.4) are approximately satisfied), then these theoretical
results should be approximately valid. In fact, Abadie et al. (2010, 2015) recommended that the
method not be used if the pre-treatment fit is bad. In light of that, our results have important
implications for the implementation of the SC method.
First, our results provide new insights on the trade-offs involved in the choice of predictors in
the implementation of the SC estimator. For example, it is not clear whether one should include all
pre-treatment outcome lags as predictors. Although this is a common procedure in SC applications,
Kaul et al. (2018) showed that including all pre-treatment outcome lags as predictors renders all
other covariates irrelevant in the optimization procedure suggested by Abadie and Gardeazabal
(2003) and Abadie et al. (2010). Although this may appear to be a problem at first sight, inasmuch
as the optimization procedure will not directly attempt to match on observed covariates, we show

the SC estimator and approximate balance for g(Z1 ). However, in general, we would not have
approximate balance for Z1 unless g (.) were linear. The same reasoning would apply if we
consider a more general model in which potential outcomes follow a linear factor model, where
factor loadings are functions of observed and unobserved covariates, i.e., Yit (0) = ωt h(Zi , μi ) +
εit . Interestingly, when we relax the functional form of model (2.1) in this way, we should not
expect to find weights that provide a good balance in terms of both pre-treatment outcomes and
covariates. However, it is still possible to provide bounds on the bias of the SC estimator when
we have perfect balance only in terms of pre-treatment outcomes.
Taken together, these results show that there are advantages to considering weights that provide
a good balance in terms of both pre-treatment outcomes and covariates. However, there may be
empirical applications in which covariates thought to be relevant are not observed and/or there
are no weights that provide a good balance in terms of observed covariates. In such cases, we
show that it is still possible to derive bounds on the bias of the SC estimator, provided that there
are weights that provide a perfect balance in terms of pre-treatment outcomes.

that the bias of the SC estimator can still be bounded even if we have good balance only for
pre-treatment outcomes. This is true even if those covariates are relevant. On the one hand, on
the basis of our results, focusing on weights that also provide a good balance in covariates may
impose unnecessary constraints in the search for weights that provide a good balance in terms of
pre-treatment outcomes. For example, if X1 includes only covariates Z1 , then the solution to the
optimization problem suggested
by Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and Abadie et al. (2010) may

be a ŵ such that Y1t = j =1 ŵj Yj t for some t ≤ 0, even when condition (2.4) is satisfied. This
suggests that at least some pre-treatment outcome lags should be included as predictors. On the
other hand, achieving a good balance in terms of covariates may provide a better control for the
effects of those observed covariates if the number of pre-treatment periods is small, as suggested
by Kaul et al. (2018).
Interestingly, note that the inclusion of covariates as predictors when the outcome equation is
nonlinear in covariates should not necessarily be a problem if one uses the data-driven procedure
suggested by Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and Abadie et al. (2010) to determine the matrix
V. In this case, if pre-treatment outcome lags are also included as predictors, then the importance
given to such covariates would be relatively small, and the estimation procedure would not
attempt to match on covariates that should not be matched on. In contrast, if a researcher uses
an ad hoc matrix V (e.g., the identity matrix), then weights would be chosen to provide balance
on covariates that should not be balanced. Therefore, our results also highlight the importance of
using a procedure to choose the matrix V, such as the one suggested by Abadie and Gardeazabal
(2003) and Abadie et al. (2010).
We also show that it is still possible to derive bounds on the bias of the SC estimator when
observed covariates are imbalanced, even if such covariates are relevant in determining potential
outcomes. Therefore, imbalance in terms of observed covariates should not necessarily be taken
as evidence that the SC method should not be used, as long as we have a good balance in terms of
pre-treatment outcomes. This expands the possibilities of empirical applications in which the SC
method may be considered, inasmuch as observed covariates of the treated unit may not be in the
convex hull of the observed covariates of the control units, while it may still be possible to find
weights that provide a good balance in terms of pre-treatment outcomes. Our results also show
that the SC method can be used even when covariates that are thought to be crucial determinants
of the potential outcomes are not observed.
We have focused so far on the implementation of the SC method as suggested in the original SC
papers (Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003; Abadie et al., 2010, 2015). In particular, we focused on
the setting considered by Abadie et al. (2010), in which J is fixed, and we relied on perfect balance
assumptions to derive bounds on the bias of the SC estimator. In this setting, we analysed the
importance of assuming balance on covariates to derive such bounds and the role of considering
balance on covariates as a diagnostic for the method. Recent papers, such as Xu (2017) and Athey
et al. (2018), have proposed generalizations of the SC method. Xu (2017) separately estimated λt
and μi and then constructed the counterfactual for the treated unit in the post-treatment periods
by using these estimators, whereas Athey et al. (2018) considered matrix completion methods
to construct the counterfactuals. These papers relied on both J and T0 going to infinity so that
the bias of their estimators goes to zero. By doing so, they were able to relax the assumptions
of perfect balance on pre-treatment outcomes and covariates, so, in contrast to the original SC
papers, they did not consider balance on covariates as a diagnostic for whether their proposed
methods should be used. Therefore, our result that imbalance on covariates should not be taken
as evidence against the use of the SC method is more relevant when J is not large, which is the

setting considered in the original SC papers. Further analysis of the role of covariates in these
generalizations of the SC method would be an interesting area for future research.

5. EMPIRICAL ILLUSTRATION: THE ECONOMIC COST OF THE 1990
GERMAN REUNIFICATION
Abadie et al. (2015) used the SC method to estimate the economic impact of the 1990 German
reunification on West Germany. They constructed the SC weights by using average GDP per capita,
trade openness, inflation rate, industry share, schooling, and investment rate as predictor variables.
Table 1 shows that the synthetic West Germany is much closer to the actual West Germany in
terms of these covariates than is a population-weighted average for the 16 Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in the donor pool. This is not
particularly striking, given that the optimization procedure to estimate the SC weights they
considered included these variables as predictors.
We take advantage of the fact that there are a sizable number of pre-treatment periods in this
application, and we consider an alternative SC specification in which we include all pre-treatment
outcome lags (from 1960 to 1990) as predictor variables. When this alternative procedure is used to
estimate the SC weights, the synthetic West Germany is still, in general, much closer to the actual
West Germany in terms of the observed covariates than is the average of the OECD countries
(Table 1, column 4). Although the balance in terms of these covariates is not as good as in the
specification considered by Abadie et al. (2015), we emphasize that the optimization procedure
we used to estimate these SC weights did not directly use information on these variables, whereas
the procedure used by Abadie et al. (2015) did. In light of Proposition 3.1, this suggests that
some of these covariates are relevant and have independent effects on the potential outcomes, so
that the optimization procedure provides an approximate balance for them even though it does
not directly attempt to provide such balance. Finally, Figure 1 shows that the two alternative
specifications to estimate the SC weights provide very similar counterfactuals for West Germany
after the reunification.

Figure 1. Trends in per capita GDP: West Germany versus synthetic West Germany. Note: This figure
presents the per capita GDP for West Germany and for two alternative SC units: one computed by using
the SC specification outlined in Abadie et al. (2015), and another computed by using all pre-treatment
outcome lags as predictors, with no covariates.

Overall, the results from this empirical illustration corroborate one of the main messages of
our paper. In this application, the SC method focusing on matching only on the pre-treatment
outcomes leads to an SC unit that also approximates the treated unit in terms of many of the
covariates. As a consequence, the counterfactual estimated by using only pre-treatment outcomes
is very close to the original one that directly attempted to match on these covariates. Given
that we show in Section 3 that the bounds when both pre-treatment outcomes and covariates are
perfectly balanced are tighter than the bounds when we have perfect balance only on pre-treatment
outcomes, it is not clear that ignoring the covariates would be a better alternative in this case
because information on covariates can be important to reduce the bias of the estimator (for a
given T0 ). Still, these results suggest that, in this application, it would be possible to construct a
counterfactual for the treated unit even if there were no information on relevant covariates.

6. CONCLUSION
We have revisited the role of observed covariates in the SC method. We formally derived two sets
of results. First, we provided conditions under which the result derived by Abadie et al. (2010)
with regard to the bias of the SC estimator remains valid when we relax the assumption of perfect
balance on covariates and assume a perfect balance only on pre-treatment outcomes. We showed
that it remains possible to derive bounds on the bias of the SC estimator when a perfect balance
on covariates is not assumed, but that this relies on stronger assumptions and generates looser
bounds. Second, we provided conditions under which a perfect balance on pre-treatment outcomes
implies an approximate balance for the covariates. We showed that an approximate balance for
covariates may not be achieved even when the bias of the SC estimator is bounded. This may
be the case even for relevant covariates. Taken together, our results show that, although there

may be advantages to balancing on covariates to construct the SC estimator, a perfect balance on
covariates should not be required for the SC method as long as there is a perfect balance on a long
set of pre-treatment outcomes. Our results have direct implications on how applied researchers
should implement the SC method and on how they should assess the applicability of the method.

The proof for results (3.3) and () follows by similar arguments. First, define the 1 × (r + F) vector ρ k
≡ [0, 0, ..., 1, ..., 0], where only the kth element equals to 1. Consider k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ r. From equation
(A.3),e have that:

If we define γ̄ (T0 ) = max{γ̄ (T0 ), 1} > 0, then the proof of result (3.3) follows exactly

A.2. Contrasting the bounds with and without condition (2.5)
Denote by ξ̇ (T0 ) the smallest eigenvalue of
ξ (T0 ) for all T0 . Also, define
λ̄(T0 ) ≡

Because r > 0, λ̄(T0 ) ≤ γ̄ (T0 ), and ξ̇ (T0 ) ≥ ξ (T0 ), it follows that the bounds derived under conditions (2.4)
and (2.5) (equation A.12) are tighter than the bounds derived under condition (2.4) only (equation A.11).
