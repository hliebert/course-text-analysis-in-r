INTRODUCTION

Consider an experimental study in which random assignment has occurred but compliance is not perfect (i.e., the
treatment received differs from that assigned). It is well
known that under such conditions, a bias may be introduced.
Subjects who did not comply with the assignment may be
precisely those who would have responded adversely (positively) to the treatment; therefore, the actual effect of the
treatment, when applied uniformly to the population, might
be substantially less (more) effective than the study reveals.
In an attempt to avert this bias, analysts sometimes resort
to parametric models that make restrictive commitments to
a particular mode of interaction between compliance and
response (Efron and Feldman 1991). Angrist, Imbens, and
Rubin (1996) have identified a set of assumptions under
which a nonparametric correction formula, called "instrumental variables," is valid for certain subpopulations. Because these subpopulations cannot be identified from empirical observation alone, the need remains to devise alternative, assumption-free formulas for assessing the effect of
treatment over the population as a whole. Manski (1990)
and Robins (1989) have derived such bounds, but did not
make full use of the information available in the data. In this
article we provide sharp (i.e., the tightest possible) bounds
on the average treatment effect.

PROBLEM FORMULATION

The canonical partial-compliance setting can be graphically modeled as shown in Figure 1. We assume that Z, D,
and Y are observed dichotomous variables, where Z represents the (randomized) treatment assignment, D is the treatment actually received, and Y is the observed response. U
represents specific characteristics of an individual subjectnamely, all factors, both observed and unobserved, that influence the way in which a subject's outcome Y may depend

on the treatment D. The experimental study is modeled as a
two-step process: (1) treatment selection and (2) treatment
administration. In the first step, each subject is allowed to
select a treatment in accordance with the following factors:
the assignment (Z), basic physiological characteristics (U),
and, possibly, initial reactions to the treatment or placebo.
(Such reactions are not shown explicitly in the graph, because they merely modify the influence of Z and U on D,
and the diagram makes no assumption as to the nature of
this influence.) Once the treatment D is selected, the treatment administration step begins, during which subjects are
assumed to remain within their selected treatment arms until the outcome Y is recorded; back and forth switching
between placebo and active groups is not allowed at this
stage.
Given this two-stage process, the second assumption is
that the assignment (Z) per se does not alter any physiological characteristics (U) that determine how an individual would react to any given treatment. This assumption,
which Angrist et al. (1996) termed "exclusion restriction"
and Manski (1990) called "set-level restriction," is represented in the causal diagram of Figure 1 by the absence of
a direct link from Z to Y or from Z to U; all paths between
Z and Y go through D. (A fuller account of the statistical
and causal implications of structural diagrams, and their relation to Rubin's model of counterfactuals [Holland 1988],
was given in Pearl 1995a.)
To facilitate the notation, we let z, d, and Y represent the
values taken by the variables Z, D, and Y, with the following interpretation: Z E {zo, Zl}, Zl asserts that treatment
has been assigned (zo, its negation); d. E {do, d1 } ; d: asserts
that treatment has been administered (do, its negation); and
y E {Yo, Yl}, Yl asserts a positive observed response (Yo,
its negation). Multivalued or continuous outcomes can be
easily accommodated in the model using the event Y ::; Y
as a (dichotomous) outcome variable. Extension to continuous treatments is discussed in Section 3. The domain of U
remains unspecified and may in general combine the spaces
of several random variables, both discrete and continuous.
The model analyzed invokes two assumptions of independence:

1. For a given individual, the treatment assignment does
not influence Y directly, but only through the actual treatment D; that is, ZllYI{D, U}.
2. Z and U are marginally independent; that is, zsui.
This independence is ensured partly through the randomization of Z, which rules out a common cause for both Z
and U, and partly through our assumption that physiological factors (U) are not influenced by the assignment (Z).
These two independencies impose on the joint distribution the decomposition

P(y, d, z, u) = P(yld, u)P(dlz, u)P(z)P(u),
which of course cannot be observed directly, because U is
unmeasurable. (We take the liberty of denoting the prior
distribution of U by P(u), even though U may consist of
continuous variables.) However, the marginal distribution
P(y, d, z), and in particular the conditional distributions

P(y, dlz) = L

P(yld, u)P(dlz, u)P(u)

Our task is then to estimate or bound the expressions in
(2) and (3), given the observed probabilities P(y, dlz o) and
P(y, dlz l), as expressed in (1). This may be accomplished
by a procedure that we detailed in earlier work (Balke and
Pearl 1994), which is based on linear programming optimization coupled with the fact that the domain of U can be
partitioned into 16 equivalence classes, each representing
one of four possible mappings from Z to D conjoined with
one of four possible mappings from D to Y.

RESULTS

Let the conditional distribution P(y, dlz) over the observed variables be denoted as follows:

Poo.o
POl.O
PlO.O

= P(yo, dolzo) POO.I = P(yo, dolzd
= P(yO' dllzo) POLl = P(yO'dllzl)
= P(YI' dolzo) PIO.I = P(YI' dolzd
= P(YI,dllzo) Pn.l = P(YI,dllzl)

Optimization of (2) subject to the equality constraints
given in (1) defines a linear programming problem that
yields a closed-form solution by enumerating all vertices
of the constraint polygon of the dual problem. This procedure leads to the following bounds:

z E {zo, zd, are observed, and these observations constrain
the factor P(yld, u)P(u) to produce bounds on treatment
effects.
Treatment effects are characterized by a distribution
P(yld) that represents the probability that Y would have
been equal to Y, if D were equal to d under a randomized
experiment. In general, a value annotated with a checkC)
will indicate that the corresponding variable has been set to
that value by a randomized control. (Angrist et al. [1996]
and Holland [1988] denoted this distribution by P(YD=d),
but we find the "check" notation more flexible, as it permits
one to specify explicitly what is controlled and what is allowed to vary in any given study [Pearl 1995a].) Thus to
assess the distribution of Y if the treatment D were applied
uniformly to the population, we should calculate

These bounds represent the worst case (least informative)
behavior of subjects in the dm category and are implicitly
affected by the size of the dm category through the equality
P(dolz) + P(d1Iz) + P(dmlz) = 1.
When the treatment is continuous, few if any subjects
would take on any given level of treatment precisely. However, it is reasonable to assume that there exists a treatment interval around each d within which the subject's outcome is, for all practical purposes, homogeneous. In other
words, for every u we have P(Yld',u) rv P(Yld",u) for all

to apply our previous analysis and derive bounds on the average change in treatment effect between any two treatment
levels. This is illustrated in the next section.

Coronary Primary Prevention Trial

Consider the Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary
Prevention Trial data. (See Lipid Research Clinic Program
1984 for an extended description of the clinical trial.) A
portion of this dataset consisting of 337 subjects was analyzed by Efron and Feldman (1991) using a parametric
model; we use the same dataset in our analysis. A population of subjects was assembled, and two preliminary
cholesterol measurements were obtained: one prior to a suggested low-cholesterol diet (continuous variable GIl) and
one following the diet period (G12)' The initial cholesterol level (G1) was taken as a weighted average of these
two measures: G1 =.25GIl + .75G12 . The subjects were
randomized into two treatment groups: subjects receiving
cholestyramine (zd and subjects receiving a placebo (zo).
During several years of treatment, each subject's choles-

terollevel was measured multiple times, and the average of
these measurements was used as the posttreatment cholesterol level (continuous variable OF). The compliance of
each subject was determined by tracking the quantity of
prescribed dosage consumed (continuous variable B). The
maximum consumption in the dataset was 101 units.
To apply our analysis to this study, we discretize the continuous data obtained in the Lipid Research Clinic Program
(1984) study in the following way:

This discretization assumes that each subject's response to
treatment is homogeneous between 87 and 101 units of
cholestyramine. In addition, (8) reflects the finding that subjects assigned placebo (zo) did not take cholestyraminenamely, P(d1Izo) = P(dmlz o) = O. The threshold of 38 in
(9) was chosen arbitrarily. Clearly, by varing this threshold over the range of Y, one obtains upper and lower
bounds on the entire distribution of the treatment effect,
P(Y ~ yld1 ) - P(Y ~ Yldo).
If the sample data are interpreted according to (8) and
(9), then the conditional distribution over (Z, D, Y) results
in the distribution given in Table 3. (Here we make the
large-sample assumption and take the sample frequencies
as representing P(y, dlz).)
By computing the quantities required for (4), we obtain

increase by at least 26.2% the probability of reducing a
patient's level of cholesterol by 38 points or more. This
guarantee is established despite the fact that 60.6% of the
subjects in the treatment group did not comply with their assigned dosage level. For comparison, note that the intent-totreat analysis in this study gives P(Yllzd -P(Yllzo) = .408,
meaning that enforcing full compliance might result in as
much as 46% improvement and no more than 14.6% reduction in the proportion of patients benefiting from the
treatment.

CONCLUSION

In an attempt to avert confounding bias in randomized
studies involving noncompliance, analysts usually advocate
using "intent-to-treat" analysis, which compares assignment
groups regardless of the treatment actually received. Estimates derived by such analysis are free of confounding
bias, but decisions based on these estimates require that the
experimental conditions perfectly mimic the conditions prevailing in the final implementation of the treatment. In particular, the intent-to-treat analysis is inappropriate when the
inducement to receive treatment changes from what it was
in the study-for example, when a drug is officially endorsed by a well"meaning authority.
A similar weakness applies to the analysis of Angrist
et al. (1996), who derived causal effect formulas for the
unobservable subpopulation of "responsive" subjects; that
is, subjects who would have changed treatment status if
given a different assignment. This subpopulation cannot
serve as a basis for policy analysis because it is instrument
dependent-individuals who are responsive in the study
may not remain responsive in the field, where the incentives for obtaining treatment differ from those used in the
study.
In policy evaluation studies, field incentives are normally
more compelling than experimental incentives. Hence treatment effectiveness should be assessed by the average causal
effect, Eu[P(Yllu, dd-P(Yllu, do)], for which we have provided sharp theoretical bounds. Estimates based solely on
intent-to-treat analysis, as well as those based on instrumental variables, can be misleading, as they may lie entirely
outside the theoretical bounds. The formulas established in
this article provide instrument-independent guarantees for
policy analysis and should enable analysts to determine the
extent to which efforts to enforce compliance may increase
the overall treatment effectiveness.
A topic that should receive considerable attention in
future work is the augmentation of the bounds in (4)(5) with confidence intervals, to account for sample variability. Chickering and Pearl (1996) described a Bayesian
method that, using Gibbs sampling, computes the posterior distribution of ACE(D --4 Y) given the data. An alternative approach in this direction is offered by the maximum likelihood ratio test, as applied to the hypothesis H o:
ACE( D --4 Y) < t, for arbitrary t, because the maximum
likelihood function under Ho can be computed using linear
programming.
