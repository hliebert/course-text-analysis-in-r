In both political behavior research and voting rights litigation, turnout and vote choice for different racial
groups are often inferred using aggregate election results and racial composition. Over the past several
decades, many statistical methods have been proposed to address this ecological inference problem. We
propose an alternative method to reduce aggregation bias by predicting individual-level ethnicity from voter
registration records. Building on the existing methodological literature, we use Bayes’s rule to combine the
Census Bureau’s Surname List with various information from geocoded voter registration records. We
evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology using approximately nine million voter registration
records from Florida, where self-reported ethnicity is available. We find that it is possible to reduce the false
positive rate among Black and Latino voters to 6% and 3%, respectively, while maintaining the true positive
rate above 80%. Moreover, we use our predictions to estimate turnout by race and find that our estimates
yields substantially less amounts of bias and root mean squared error than standard ecological inference
estimates. We provide open-source software to implement the proposed methodology.

Introduction

In political behavior research as well as voting rights litigation, it is often of interest to infer turnout
and vote choice among diﬀerent racial groups. For instance, political scientists estimate turnout by
race in order to study disparities in political participation (e.g., Gay 2001; Hajnal and Trounstine
2005), mobilization eﬀorts (e.g., Barreto 2007), and the eﬀects of co-ethnic candidates and representatives (e.g., Herron and Sekhon 2005). In voting rights cases, litigants wish to estimate turnout
and vote choice among ethnic groups to build empirical evidence for the existence of racial polarization (e.g., Greiner 2007).
However, such eﬀorts face a well-known methodological obstacle, known as the ecological inference problem. Since the race of individual voters is typically unknown, one must infer turnout by
race from aggregate data. A number of statistical methods have been developed to address this
problem (e.g., Goodman 1953; King 1997; King, Rosen, and Tanner 2004; Wakeﬁeld 2004; Greiner
and Quinn 2008; Imai, Lu, and Strauss 2008). Nevertheless, all of these methods suﬀer from a
fundamental problem of indeterminacy, and as a result, in recent years, methodologists have turned
to the idea of combining aggregate data with individual-level data (e.g., Wakeﬁeld 2004; Imai Lu,
and Strauss 2008; Greiner and Quinn 2010).

In this article, we propose to improve upon ecological inference by predicting individual race
from voter registration records. Building on the existing methodological literature in public health
(Fiscella and Fremont 2006; Elliott et al. 2008, 2009), we use Bayes’s rule to combine the Census
Bureau’s Surname List with information in geocoded voter registration records. By incorporating
additional information such as party registration, this methodological framework oﬀers improvements over the common practice of using surname alone or surname and geolocation to predict
individual ethnicity (e.g., Michelson 2003; Barreto, Segura, and Woods 2004; Tam Cho, Gimpel,
and Dyck 2006; Fieldhouse and Cutts 2008; Henderson, Sekhon, and Titiunik 2014; Enos 2015;
Harris 2015). We also explicate and probe the assumptions that underlie the existing and proposed
methods. Although some scholars have turned to proprietary methods of estimating voter race
(e.g., Ansolabehere and Hersh 2003; Fraga 2013, 2016), we believe that methodological transparency is important for academic research, and these assumptions reveal the promise and limitations
of the methods discussed here.1 To implement the proposed methodology, the R package, wru:
Who Are You? Bayesian Prediction of Racial Category Using Surname and
Geolocation, is freely available for download at https://cran.r-project.org/package¼wru.
Finally, this article reports the results of a large-scale empirical validation study. We examine the
performance of various methods of estimating individual-level race, as well as turnout by race at the
precinct and district levels. Speciﬁcally, we use the Florida voter ﬁle, predicting the race of over nine
million voters and validating our predictions using self-reported race data.2 We choose Florida
because self-reported race is collected on voter registration cards by law.3 Florida also has a relatively large number of Blacks and Latinos, enabling us to empirically validate the accuracy of the
proposed method and other methods at the individual level among these minority groups. We show
that the proposed method reduces the false positive rate among Black and Latino voters to 6% and
3%, respectively, while maintaining the true positive rate at above 80%. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the
bias and root mean squared error (RMSE) of our estimated turnout by racial groups are substantially less than those of the standard ecological inference estimates.

The Methodology

We begin by describing the existing Bayesian method in public health that combines the surname
list with the geocoded location of individual residence. We then describe our extension, which
allows researchers to incorporate the various information in voter registration records.
2.1

The Bayesian Prediction

Researchers interested in measuring racial disparities in healthcare have developed a methodology
to combine surname analysis and geocoded data to estimate individual race via Bayes’s rule
(Fiscella and Fremont 2006; Elliott et al. 2008, 2009). We begin by describing the Bayesian
method developed by Elliott et al. (2009). Let the surname and geolocation of voter i be denoted
by Si and Gi, respectively. We use Ri to represent an unobserved variable indicating the racial group
voter i belongs to. Let R; G, and S represent the set of all racial groups, all geolocations, and all
surnames, respectively.
We are interested in estimating Pr ðRi ¼ rjSi ¼ s; Gi ¼ gÞ, or the conditional probability that
voter i belongs to racial group r given his/her surname s and geolocation g. Using the data from the
Census Bureau, we have the racial composition of frequently occurring surnames, that is,
1

In addition, unlike the Bayesian methods, the Catalist’s race prediction method does not offer a formal probabilistic
prediction and instead utilizes an informal scheme of “Highly Likely,” “Likely,” and “Possibly.”
2
Fraga (2016) conducts an empirical validation of Catalist’s proprietary race prediction method. There are several
differences between the current validation and that of Fraga (2016). For example, Catalist bases its predictions on
self-reported race in the voter file whenever it is available. In contrast, our goal is to predict individual race when such
information is not available. To do this, we utilize other available information in the voter file, such as surname,
geolocation, and party registration.
3
Voter registration cards in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina ask
voters to identify their race/ethnicity. Pennsylvania and Tennessee provide an optional blank field for race.

Pr ðRi ¼ rjSi ¼ sÞ, the racial composition of each geolocation (e.g., Census blocks and voting precincts), that is, Pr ðRi ¼ rjGi ¼ gÞ, and the population proportion of each geolocation, that is,
Pr ðGi ¼ gÞ.
The method assumes that geolocation and surname are statistically independent conditional on
race. That is, once we know a voter’s race, her surname is not informative about where she lives.4
We formalize this assumption as follows:
Gi ?
? Si jRi :

ð1Þ

Assuming equation (1) holds, Bayes’s rule implies
Pr ðGi ¼ gjRi ¼ rÞPr ðRi ¼ rjSi ¼ sÞ
PrðRi ¼ rjSi ¼ s; Gi ¼ gÞ ¼ X
;
Pr ðGi ¼ gjRi ¼ r0 ÞPr ðRi ¼ r0 jSi ¼ sÞ

ð2Þ

r0 2R

where usingP Bayes’s rule again we can calculate Pr ðGi ¼ gjRi ¼ rÞ as Pr ðRi ¼ rjGi ¼ gÞ
Pr ðGi ¼ gÞ= g0 2 R Pr ðRi ¼ rjGi ¼ g0 ÞPr ðGi ¼ g0 Þ. Thus, the method provides a probabilistic prediction of individual ethnicity.
2.2

The Proposed Extension

We propose to extend the above Bayesian prediction method by incorporating a set of individuallevel covariates available in the voter ﬁles. In this article, we focus on age, gender, and party
registration, which are often available in voter ﬁles. However, under the proposed framework,
other information can be incorporated in a similar manner. Let Xi represent our two demographic
variables, that is, age and gender. Furthermore, let Pi represent the party registration of voter i.
To incorporate the demographic variables Xi, we replace the assumption given in equation (1)
with the following:
fGi ; Xi g ?? Si jRi :

ð3Þ

This assumption states that given a voter’s race, his/her surname does not contain any information
about his/her geolocation and demographics. It could be violated, for example, if the rate of
interracial marriage is correlated with surname and geolocation through age or gender within
each racial category.5 As with equation (1), we view the validity of this assumption as an empirical
question.
If equation (3) holds, it is straightforward to predict individual race using Bayes’s rule,
Pr ðGi ¼ g; Xi ¼ xjRi ¼ rÞPr ðRi ¼ rjSi ¼ sÞ
PrðRi ¼ rjSi ¼ s; Gi ¼ g; Xi ¼ xÞ ¼ X
;
Pr ðGi ¼ g; Xi ¼ xjRi ¼ r0ÞPr ðRi ¼ r0 jSi ¼ sÞ

ð4Þ

r02R

where Pr ðGi ¼ g; Xi ¼ xjRi ¼ rÞ can be obtained from the Census Summary File.
We further extend this method to incorporate party registration as well as demographics by considering two possibilities. The ﬁrst approach requires that researchers have information about the
population distribution of party registration given each racial category, that is, Pr ðPi ¼ pjRi ¼ rÞ
for all p 2 P and r 2 R, where P is the set of all parties.6 For example, we may obtain an estimate of
this quantity from a national survey. This approach is based on the following conditional
4

There are different ways in which this assumption could be violated. For example, surnames may be associated with
wealth, which may be predictive of where people live, even within a racial group. Another scenario is that within racial
groups, families cluster together in neighborhoods. While recognizing these possibilities, ultimately, we view the validity
of this assumption as an empirical question. Our analysis shows that by conditioning on race, we can account for much
of the association between surname and geolocation (see Supplementary Appendix A.3). We also find that our predictions of race are quite accurate, suggesting that equation (1) is reasonable.
5
We thank an anonymous reviewer for pointing out this possibility.
6
We classify voters as Democrats, Republicans, or Other. Other includes Independents and members of minor parties.
Knowing that a voter is not registered with a major party is informative, because the racial composition of this group
differs from the racial composition of registered Democrats and Republicans.

Equation (5) implies that once we know a voter’s race, his/her surname is not informative about his/
her geolocation, party registration, and demographics. Similarly, the second assumption in
equation (6) states that given a voter’s race, his/her party registration does not provide any additional information about his/her geolocation and demographics. Under these assumptions, we can
apply Bayes’s rule to predict individual ethnicity:
Pr ðRi ¼ rjSi ¼ s; Gi ¼ g; Xi ¼ x; Pi ¼ pÞ
Pr ðGi ¼ g; Xi ¼ xjRi ¼ rÞPr ðPi ¼ pjRi ¼ rÞPr ðRi ¼ rjSi ¼ sÞ
:

Pr ðGi ¼ g; Xi ¼ xjRi ¼ r0ÞPr ðPi ¼ pjRi ¼ r0ÞPr ðRi ¼ r0jSi ¼ sÞ

ð7Þ

Unlike the ﬁrst approach, the second approach for incorporating party registration allows one to
predict race without additional information. This alternative strategy is based on the following
independence assumption as well as the assumption given in equation (1):7
fXi ; Pi g ?
? Si jGi ; Ri ;

ð8Þ

which implies that given a voter’s geolocation and race, her surname has no predictive power for
her demographics and party registration. Under these assumptions, the application of Bayes’s rule
yields:
Pr ðRi ¼ rjSi ¼ s; Gi ¼ g; Pi ¼ p; Xi ¼ xÞ
Pr ðPi ¼ p; Xi ¼ xjGi ¼ g; Ri ¼ rÞPr ðGi ¼ gjRi ¼ rÞPr ðRi ¼ rjSi ¼ sÞ
¼ X
;
Pr ðPi ¼ p; Xi ¼ xjGi ¼ g; Ri ¼ r0ÞPr ðGi ¼ gjRi ¼ r0ÞPr ðRi ¼ r0jSi ¼ sÞ

ð9Þ

r02R

where we model the ﬁrst term in the numerator and denominator as:
Pr ðPi ¼ p; Xi ¼ xjGi ¼ g; Ri ¼ rÞ

ð10Þ

¼ Pr ðPi ¼ pjXi ¼ x; Gi ¼ g; Ri ¼ rÞPr ðXi ¼ xjGi ¼ g; Ri ¼ rÞ:
The second term of this equation can be calculated
P directly from the Census data as
Pr ðXi ¼ xjGi ¼ g; Ri ¼ rÞ ¼ Pr ðXi ¼ x; Ri ¼ rjGi ¼ gÞ= x0 2X Pr ðXi ¼ x0 ; Ri ¼ rjGi ¼ gÞ. The ﬁrst
term is unknown but models the party registration as a function of demographics, geolocation, and
race. To estimate this model and obtain a maximum likelihood estimate of individual race via
equation (9), we use the standard Expectation-Maximization algorithm by treating race as missing
data (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977) (see Supplementary Appendix A.2 for details).

Empirical Validation

In this section, we present an empirical validation study of the methods described above and assess
the accuracy of their prediction relative to that of the existing methods.

Technically, the assumption given in equation (8) can be slightly relaxed using the following set of sequential independence assumptions, although in our empirical study they do not appear to make substantial differences:

Data

We analyze voter registration data from Florida, which include approximately ten million individual records. Our data are based on statewide voter ﬁles and come from L2 (formerly Labels & Lists,
Inc.), a leading nonpartisan ﬁrm and the oldest organization in the United States that supplies voter
data and related technology to candidates, political parties, pollsters, and consultants for use in
campaigns. For every active registered voter in the state, we have gender, birth date, original
registration date, address, district, precinct, party registration, and turnout history.8
We also use the 2010 U.S. Census Summary File for Florida, which contains the joint distribution of individual characteristics, including age, gender, and race, at the levels of various geographical units, including blocks, tracts, and precincts. The summary ﬁle contains raw counts
of individuals, which we aggregate by various geographical units and then use to calculate
Pr ðGi jRi ¼ rÞ and Pr ðGi ; Xi jRi ¼ rÞ. As explained in more detail in Barber and Imai (2013), we
geocode voters in the L2 data using their addresses so that we know the geographical unit to which
each voter belongs. We also verify that the Census data accurately reﬂect the racial composition of
voting precincts in the L2 data (see Figure 3 in Supplementary Appendix A.4).
The Census Bureau also provides data on the racial distribution of surnames in the United
States. In 2007, the Census Bureau released the percent of individuals who are White, Black,
Latino, Asian, and so on for each surname occurring at least 100 times in the 2000 Census. The
list contains a total of 151,671 names, capturing 90% of the population enumerated in the 2000
Census. We supplement this list with Census’s Spanish Surname List, which contains 12,500
common Latino surnames, about half of which are on the 2007 Census Surname List. From this
data, we can calculate Pr ðRi ¼ rjSi Þ for well over 150,000 surnames in the U.S. See Supplementary
Appendix A.1 for details.
We divide race into ﬁve categories: White, Black, Latino, Asian, and Other. These are similar to
the racial groups used in the Census data and self-reported race in the voter ﬁles. The major
diﬀerence is that we do group American Indian/Alaska Native with Other, because American
Indians and Alaska Natives jointly constitute less than 1% of records in the Florida voter ﬁle.
Moreover, we ﬁnd that our misclassiﬁcation rate is approximately equal among the American
Indian/Alaska Native and Other groups.9
3.2

Validation of Race Predictions

To validate the proposed methodology, we compare the race predictions from each method with
voters’ self-reported race, which is available for approximately nine million voters in Florida. For
each voter, we ﬁnd the race with the greatest predicted probability and classify the voter as belonging to that racial group. The goal of this validation exercise is to examine whether and how
additional information, such as geolocation and party registration, improves the race predictions.
We assess the performance of each method by calculating the overall error rate, which simply
represents the proportion of voters whose racial group it incorrectly classiﬁes. We also compute the
two types of group-speciﬁc error rates: false positives (Type I errors) and false negatives (Type II
errors). For example, with respect to Latinos, classifying a non-Latino voter as Latino would be a
false positive, whereas classifying a Latino voter as non-Latino would be a false negative. Although
the goal is to minimize both types of error, there is a clear trade-oﬀ between the two.
Table 1 displays the error rates for ﬁve sets of predictions based on diﬀerent sets of information.
We begin with a name-only prediction that classiﬁes race on the basis of the Census Surname List.
We then enhance the prediction by incorporating voters’ geolocation, testing both voting precinct
8

The data contain all active registrants as of July 2012. L2 removes voters who were classified as inactive by the
Secretary of State’s Office. Inactive voters are those who did not vote in the past several elections or respond to an
official request to confirm their address and registration. See Barber and Imai (2013) for details. Replication files are
available at http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/SVY5VF.
9
We combine the Census Mixed Race category with Other, because our voter files do not have a separate mixed-race
category. However, in theory, researchers may use Census data to identify the growing mixed-race population, which is
over nine million or 2.9% of the U.S. population in 2010.

Notes: The table displays the overall classification error rate as well as false negative (Type I error) and false positive (Type II error) rates
for White, Black, Latino, Asian, and Other voters using our proposed prediction method. We classify each registered voter to the racial
category with the greatest predicted probability. Each column corresponds to the results based on different sets of information. We start
with the information based on the Census Surname List only and then add the voter’s geolocation and party registration. The total sample
size is 9,247,810.

and Census block. Finally, we include voters’ party registration as an individual-level covariate. We
use publicly available Gallup polling data to obtain the distribution of partisanship by race, that is,
Pr ðPi ¼ pjRi ¼ rÞ (Newport 2013).
The ﬁrst row of Table 1 displays each prediction method’s overall classiﬁcation error rate,
measuring the accuracy of each prediction across all voters. We ﬁnd that the additional information
reduces the overall error rate from approximately 22%, which is obtained when only voters’ names
are used, to 15% when their geolocation and party registration are incorporated. In particular, the
prediction based on voters’ name, block, and party registration performs best according to this
measure. We also ﬁnd that using demographics does not substantially change our predictions. In
addition, our second method of incorporating party registration, which does not require external
data on the distribution of partisanship by race, performs slightly worse than the ones presented
here (see Table 4 in Supplementary Appendix A.5 for a full set of results).
We further examine the performance of the proposed methodology for each racial category.
Among Whites, the name-only prediction results in a substantially high false positive rate of over
50%. Incorporating voters’ geolocation and party registration, we are able to reduce this to approximately 25% without substantially increasing the false negative rate. Among Blacks, the false
negative rate for the name-only prediction exceeds 80%, while incorporating additional information reduces this by more than half. In both cases, adding party registration as well as geolocation
appears to be beneﬁcial.10
For Latinos and Asians, the improvement in accuracy due to the additional information appears
to be minimal. Among Latinos, the name-only prediction already has a relatively low false negative
rate of about 19%.11 Indeed, incorporating voters’ geolocation and party registration further decreases the false negative rate, but only by three to four percentage points. Among Asians, who
consist of only 2% of Florida registered voters, there is little performance diﬀerence across the

10

We examined the self-reported race of voters we incorrectly classified as Whites (i.e., false positives). We find that voters
misclassified as Whites are 50% Blacks, 18% Latinos, 7% Asians, and 25% Others. Among Black voters who are
misclassified (i.e., false negatives), 94% are misclassified as Whites.
11
We examined whether using the Spanish Surname List helps identify Latinos. We find that whether or not we use this
list in conjunction with the full Census Surname List, our accuracy among Latinos remains nearly identical. We
recomputed the Name and Precinct and the Name, Precinct, and Party predictions without using the Spanish
Surname List and obtained the almost same overall error rate and false negative and positive rates as we report in
Table 1. We suspect that this is because the Census Surname List contains many prominent Spanish surnames.

Fig. 1 ROC curves for the proposed race prediction methods. ROC curves plot true positive rate (vertical

under the ROC curves, given in the legend, summarizes the overall classification success. Among White and

improves classification accuracy. Adding voter party registration (“Party”) results in further improvements.
Among Latino voters, surname alone yields a high success rate and adding other information produces
minor improvements.

methods. All methods have a high false negative rate, suggesting that it is diﬃcult to identify Asian
voters from the set of information considered in this article alone.12
A more comprehensive comparison of predictions, while recognizing the trade-oﬀ between false
negatives and false positives, is to examine the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for
each prediction method. Rather than classifying voters on the basis of the greatest predicted probability, ROC curves display the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (speciﬁcity) for a variety of classiﬁcation thresholds. Since it is desirable to have a higher true positive
rate given a false negative rate (or a lower false negative rate given a true positive rate), the area
under the ROC curve can be used to evaluate the performance.
In Figure 1, we plot ROC curves for three predictions among White, Black, and Latino voters.
Among Whites and Blacks, we observe that the information about voters’ geolocation signiﬁcantly
improves the accuracy of race prediction while adding the party registration yields only a modest
improvement. Among Latinos, as we saw earlier, the name-only prediction performs relatively well.
The ﬁgure shows that it is possible to reduce the false negative rate among Blacks and Latinos to
0.06 and 0.03, respectively, while maintaining the true positive rate above 0.8. This means that our
method correctly classiﬁes over 80% of Blacks and Latinos, while only misclassifying 6% of nonBlacks as Black and 3% of non-Latinos as Latino.
3.3

Validation of the Turnout Estimates

We now estimate voter turnout by racial category and validate our estimates against actual turnout
by race at the precinct and congressional district levels in Florida. The goal is to investigate whether
individual-level racial predictions improve the race-speciﬁc turnout rates obtained from the
standard ecological inference techniques widely used in academia and elsewhere (i.e., Goodman
1953; King 1997).
We focus on turnout among White, Black, Latino, Asian, and Other registered voters in the 2008
presidential election. We estimate aggregate turnout for each racial group using the predicted
probabilities directly. Speciﬁcally, we calculate the aggregate turnout for each race as the weighted
average of turnout,

As was the case with Black voters, the vast majority of false negatives among Latinos (86%) and Asians (75%) are

Notes: Goodman’s regression, King’s EI, name-only prediction (based on the Census Surname List), and our proposed Bayesian prediction
method. Although Goodman’s regression and King’s EI use precinct-level turnout and racial composition data only, the proposed Bayesian
methodology uses the name, residence location, and party registration of voters. Precinct-level bias and RMSE are weighted by the number
of voters for each precinct. Generally, the proposed Bayesian method performs best, though the name-only prediction also yields a
reasonable performance.

the Census surname alone and compute ni¼1 Pr ðRi ¼ rjSi ÞYi = ni¼1 Pr ðRi ¼ rjSi Þ.
We validate our estimates against true precinct-level and district-level turnout, which can be
computed using the self-reported race for each voter. In addition to the name-only prediction, we
compare the performance of our methodology against the two standard ecological inference techniques, that is, Goodman’s ecological regression (Goodman 1953), and the King’s EI (King 1997).
Goodman’s method regresses overall turnout on the proportion of voters of a particular race to
estimate turnout for that race. The method assumes that the average turnout rate for each racial
group does not depend on racial composition. We ﬁt Goodman’s ecological regression using
precinct-level data in each congressional district. We ﬁt a separate univariate model for each of
the ﬁve racial groups.13 This yields the estimates of turnout by race that can be used at both the
precinct and district levels. The second standard technique is King’s EI, which yields precinct-level
turnout estimates (King and Roberts 2012). We ﬁt a separate 2  2 EI model for each racial group,
one district at a time. We then aggregate the estimated turnout among precincts within a district to
estimate district-level turnout.
Table 2 reports the bias and RMSE of turnout estimates at both the precinct and district levels
for each method. We begin by considering the two standard techniques. Goodman’s regression does
not perform well, underestimating turnout among Blacks, Latinos, and Others by over ten percentage points at the precinct level on average. The bias increases at the district level. Moreover, the
RMSE is large for all groups but Whites. King’s EI also performs poorly at the precinct and district
levels, yielding large bias and RMSE. It is particularly biased for Others, underestimating turnout
by over thirty percentage points on average.14
The name-only prediction and the proposed Bayesian approach signiﬁcantly improve the results
of the aforementioned standard methods. Both have much smaller bias and RMSE. In general, the
proposed Bayesian methodology performs best, providing essentially unbiased estimates for
Whites, Blacks, and Latinos. The magnitude of bias is somewhat larger for Asians and Others,
13

We also fit a multivariate linear regression, regressing the overall turnout on the proportions of all racial groups. These
results are substantively similar to the univariate results presented here (see Table 5 in Supplementary Appendix A.5).
14
We also examine the performance of these methods in racially homogeneous precincts (defined as having over 90% of
one race). In our data, the vast majority (92%) of such precincts are homogeneously White. The Bayesian predictions
significantly outperform the other methods (see Table 6 in Supplementary Appendix A.5).

Improving Ecological Inference by Predicting Individual Ethnicity

but is still less than ﬁve percentage points. In Table 5 provided in Supplementary Appendix A.5, we
also present the results based on the name-only and Bayesian classiﬁcations, which classify each
voter to a racial group and then aggregate turnout. As expected, these methods, which do not
incorporate the uncertainty in the predictions, perform slightly worse than the corresponding
methods presented here.
The name-only prediction does surprisingly well despite the fact that its classiﬁcation error rate is
greater than that of the Bayesian method. Indeed, the performance of the name-only prediction
method is roughly comparable to that of the Bayesian method. This apparent inconsistency can
occur because the turnout rate is approximately equal among false negative and false positive
voters. That is, the classiﬁcation error based on the Census Surname List is roughly independent
of turnout (see Table 7 in Supplementary Appendix A.5). However, in other settings, such independence may not hold. As such, we recommend that applied researchers and litigators use the
proposed Bayesian methodology.

Concluding Remarks

This article reviews and extends the methodology for predicting the race of an individual by
incorporating name, geocoded residence, and other information from voter ﬁles. Our validation
study has shown that the proposed Bayesian methodology provides accurate individual-level predictions and signiﬁcantly improves the estimation of aggregate-level turnout for each racial group
relative to the standard ecological inference methods. We believe that this methodology enables
academic researchers and litigators to conduct more reliable ecological inference in states where
registered voters are not asked to report their race. A straightforward and yet useful extension of
the proposed methodology is to incorporate vote choice from survey data for predicting candidate
choice as well as turnout by racial groups.
