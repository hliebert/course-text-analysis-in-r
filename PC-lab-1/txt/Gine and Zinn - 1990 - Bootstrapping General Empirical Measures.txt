BOOTSTRAPPING GENERAL EMPIRICAL MEASURES

BY EVARIST GINO1 AND JOEL ZINN2
Texas A & M University
It is proved that the bootstrapped central limit theorem for empirical

processes indexed by a class of functions F and based on a probability

measure P holds a.s. if and only if Fe CLT(P) and fF2dP < co, where

F = supf . r-f 1, and it holds in probability if and only if -E- CLT(P).

Thus, for a large class of statistics, no local uniformity of the CLT

(about P) is needed for the bootstrap to work. Consistency of the bootstrap
(the bootstrapped law of large numbers) is also characterized. (These

results are proved under certain weak measurability assumptions on A.)

1. Introduction. Efron (1979) introduced the "bootstrap," a resampling
method for approximating the distribution functions of statistics

Hn(X1 ... . Xn; P), where the random variables Xi are independe
cally distributed with common law P [i.i.d.(P)]. Since the empirical measure
n

(1.1) Pn(t) = n x, (w)

is (a.s.) close to P, one may hope th
X are obtained by sampling from the data, with replacement), then the

distribution of HnI(w) = Hn(Xnl .. . Xnn; Pn(W)) is w-a.s. asymptotical
to that of Hn(Xl ... . Xn; P). In turn, the distribution of the bootstrapped
statistic, Hn(w) can be approximated by Monte Carlo simulation. This suggestive method has been validated with limit theorems for many particular HnI()
by Efron (1979), Bickel and Freedman (1981), Singh (1981), Beran (1982,
1984), Bretagnolle (1983), Gaenssler (1987) and others. In this article we offer

a justification of the bootstrap for functions Hn of a special type, namely for
continuous functions of the empirical measure viewed as an element of t($),
for classes of functions A. Such H include the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and the
Cramer-von Mises statistics (in any number of dimensions) as well as the
statistics considered in Beran and Millar (1986).

Let (S, -/, P) be a probability space, let Xi: (Sr, Y, Pa) (S, ?/, P)

the coordinate functions [i.i.d.(P)], let Pn(&)) be as in (1.1) for c E S ", let XW
= 1, ... , n, be i.i.d.(Pn(w)), let Pn(w) be the empirical measure based on
{Xn}J)=1, i.e.,

and let Y7 be a class of measurable functions on (S, -/) such that

(1.3)

F=:

is finite for all s E S. We then prove that, under some measurability on A7, the
conditions

(1.4)

<

X

and

(1.5) n1/2(Pn - P) -- Gp weakly in I(w'9)
are necessary and sufficient for

(1.6) nl/2(P((X) - P((X)) -> G weakly in 1X(), w-a.s.

for a centered Gaussian process G independent of w. Then G coincides with

Gp, the Gaussian limit in (1.5).

Thus, this result completely settles, modulo measurability, the question of

the validity of the bootstrap for the CLT for empirical processes indexed by
classes of functions (or sets).
The main feature of this theorem, aside from its generality, is that no
assumptions are made on local uniformity (about P) of the CLT (1.5) for the
bootstrap CLT (1.6) to hold [this was unexpected in view of, e.g., the comments
in Bickel and Freedman (1981), page 1209]. Another new feature is necessity of
the integrability condition (1.4) and the usual CLT (1.5) for the bootstrap.
The proof relies on several results and techniques from probability in
Banach spaces. Among other such results and techniques, we use symmetrization by randomization in an essential way [an idea in Pisier (1985) has been
useful in connection with this], results of Le Cam (1970) on Poissonization and
on the CLT in Banach spaces, integrability of Gaussian processes [e.g.,
Fernique (1984)], Hoffmann-J0rgensen's (1974) inequality and convergence of
moments in the CLT in Banach spaces [de Acosta and Gine (1979)], results on
empirical processes from Gine and Zinn (1984, 1986) and, particularly, a result
of Ledoux, Talagrand and Zinn [cf. Ledoux and Talagrand (1988b)] on the

almost sure weak convergence of E i= 1gi X.(co)/n1/2, gi i.i.d. with
fo(P{Ig1I > t})1/2 dt < so (i.e., g, E L2 1). Actually, it is this last result that

at the base of our proof. The Ledoux-Talagrand-Zinn result uses for its proof

a recent extension of Yurinski's decomposition as applied to EgIIEg-xJIJ

EJIL gi Xi I. This was observed by Ledoux and Talagrand (1988a) in the proof
one of the main results about the law of the iterated logarithm in Banach

spaces.

The above techniques (except for the result of Ledoux, Talagrand and Zinn)
are also used to obtain a similar result for the bootstrap in probability. The a.s.
results are given in Section 2 and Section 3 contains the "in probability"
result.
The bootstrapped law of the large numbers, much easier to prove than the

CLT, is also characterized.

BOOTSTRAPPING EMPIRICAL MEASURES 853

2. The a.s. bootstrapped limit theorems. Given P, a probability measure on a measure space (S, Ak'), we let

(2.1) p2 ( f, g) = f - g)2 dP - ( f - g))dP2 f,g Ef2(P),

(22) e2( f, g) = f _ g)2dp, fg Ef2(P)
and, given a collection Y of P-square integrable functions on (S, 1J), we let

2 3)'={ f - g: f, g E S , epf f, g) < } 8 > 0,

(2.3) '=fgfg Y

( ~ ~~~~ f- = {fg: f, g C- 99

and

(2.4) (,F,)2= {(fg)2: f,g Ah.
Gp = {Gp(f): f E 94} denotes a centered Gaussian process indexed by 9A,
with covariance

(2.5) EGp( f ) Gp(g) = f fgdP - ffdP g dP, f, g E 5
and Zp {Zp ( f ): f E FY denotes the centered Gaussian process with
(2.6) EZp(f)Zp(g) = fgdP, f,g E F.
We recall Hoffmann-J0rgensen's (1984) definition of weak convergence in
0(5F), the space of bounded functions Am-> OR with the sup norm topology: a

sequence {Y,}?=1 of random elements of i(5) converges weakly in i'(Y

if there exists a Radon probability measure y on i(S) such that for all
H: i(S) R bounded and continuous,

lim E*H(Y=) fHdy.

n -- oo

Then we say that Fe CLT(P) if the sequence {n 1/2(Pn - P)(f): f E F}
converges weakly in 1G(F) to a Radon centered Gaussian probability measure

yp on i(Y). yp is the law of Gp which, by virtue of the Radonicity of yp,

admits a version with bounded uniformly continuous paths on (I, pp), and
(I, pp) is totally bounded [see, e.g., Gine and Zinn (1986)]. We continue
denoting this version by Gp.
If F satisfies certain measurability conditions, then Pn can be randomized

(i.e., we can replace Ax, - P by (i~x with (i symmetric, independent of X

and satisfying certain integrability conditions) and Fubini's theorem can be

used freely. These conditions, spelled out in Gine and Zinn (1984), are that Y
be nearly linearly deviation measurable for P, NLDM(P) for short, and that
both 2 and 52 are nearly linearly supremum measurable for P, NLSM(P).
In this paper if F satisfies all of the above conditions with respect to P we

write FYe M(P). To see why FSe M(P) suffices we note, as in Gine and Zinn

(1984), Remark 2.4 (2), page 935, that the measurability of the map

implies, for example, the measurability for any M < oo of the map

by considering the composition of the map

(Xi, . . . Xn) >- (I(F(x,) < M), *.. * I(F(Xn) < M), X1 ..*.*. Xn)
with the measurable map given by hypothesis. Actually close consideration of
the proofs shows that even weaker hypotheses suffice, but the best measurability is not our concern here. We further note that if F is countable, or if

{Pnrn=l are stochastically separable in Y, or more generally, if 5; i

The following proposition is the first step in the proof of the bootstrap CLT.
It is a version of Le Cam's Poissonization lemma [Le Cam (1970); reproduced
in Araujo and Gine (1980), Theorem 3.4.8] for expectations.
2.1. LEMMA. Let B be a separable Banach space and let be a measur-

able pseudonorm on B. For some n E a, let {Xijln 1 be independent sy

n= v * * v, that PoisEvi = (Pois v1)* * *(Pois vie), and that if ( =(

N' independent Poisson real random variables with expectation 1/2; we will
call N a symmetrized Poisson random variable.] Here is a proof of inequality

(2.7): If Xi are independent, XiO = 0, -/(Xij) = -f(Xi) for j > 0 and Ni are

Poisson with parameter 1, independent and independent of {Xij}, then Fubini'

BOOTSTRAPPING EMPIRICAL MEASURES 857

The bootstrap CLT is as follows.

2.4. THEOREM. Let Fe M(P) and let P be a probability measure on

(SI A/9). Let PnI Pn(wo), cO E S , and GP be as defined in (1.1),
Then the following are equivalent:

(a) JF2dP < 0o and 9Fe CLT(P).
(b) There exists a centered Gaussian process G on Y_ whose law is Radon in

i/'(5F) such that, PN-a.s., n"2(Pn(co) - P(co)) -> G weakly in lN(S).
If either (a) or (b) holds, then G = Gp.
PROOF. (a) (b). Obviously, if N is a Poisson real random variable, then
f-(P{N > t})1/2 dt < oo. So, Lemma 1.2.4 in Gine and Zinn (1986) holds for

gk = Nk, a sequence of i.i.d. symmetrized Poisson real random variables wit
parameter 1/2; hence, their Theorem 1.2.8 [(a) =* (e)] gives

CLT (b) with G = Gp by, e.g., Theorem 1.1.3 in Gine and Zinn (1986) (which,

although given for the i.i.d. sequence case, holds, with the same proof, for

triangular arrays as well).

(b) =* (a). We show first that if (b) holds then fF2dP < oo. Note that the
convergence in (b) is actually weak convergence of Radon measures (for each o
for which there is convergence) and therefore the CLT theory for separable

Banach spaces applies. The system {Y.( ) = n- /28c } is infinitesimal c-a.s.:

rational E > 0). Hence, since o-a.s. the sequence {E '=_Ynj(&G)} is shift con

Theorem 3.5.4 that

material following (2.25)].

The law of large numbers has a proof similar to that of Theorem 2.4 but

simpler since, in this case, the lemma of Ledoux, Talagrand and Zinn is not
needed and some further simplifications are also possible.

3. The bootstrapped (in probability) limit theorems. We first give
the appropriate notion of bootstrap in probability in the context of empirical
processes and show how it can be used.
In Gine and Zinn [(1986), theorem 1.1.3], we give a natural and short proof

of: 9E CLT(P) iff (, pp) is totally bounded and the usual eventual equicontinuity condition holds. This proof actually shows that Y-e CLT(P) iff S is
P-pre-Gaussian and

(3.1) sup IE*H(nl/2(Pn - P)) - EH(Gp)l -> 0,
Hc=BLj10(Y(F))

where BL1(m(57)) = {H: /w(94) -> lR, IH(x) - H(y)l < lix - yIIF-, IIHII. ? 1).

With some abuse of notation, we may call the quantity in (3.1),

d BL*(y(nl/2(p - P)), _/-(Gp))
as in the case when these are true probability laws [h1"2(Pn - P) may not be
measurable as an 1"(Y-)-valued random element]. The above observation

extends also to more general limit theorems (e.g., non-i.i.d., different n

ings). In particular nl/2( A(c)) - Pj(cv)) -> Gp weakly in i0GS4), cw-a.

So, it is justifiable to say that the bootstrapped CLT(P) holds in probability
if the limit (3.2) takes place in outer probability.

To see the usefulness of this notion, suppose that II Pn - P F is measurable,

that (JGp(ZF has a continuous distribution and that F satisfies both the

CLT(P) and the bootstrapped CLT(P) in probability. Since H = H o

BL1(i1(SF)) if H E BL1(0), we have

(3.3) dBL*( n(l/2IAPn((R) -Pn( 11))II-)X,- (IIGpiI-)G ) I 0 inpr.
By passing back and forth to a.s. convergent subsequences, since dBL* metrizes

weak convergence in [R, we get from (3.3) that

(3.4) SUP IFl1/21IIn(W)-Pn0W)11(X) -FJIGJ,(x)1 ---*> 0 in pr
xeR

(where Yf denotes the distribution function of the real random variable t). By
the assumptions, we also have

(3.5) SUP IFn1/2IP-PnIp9(X) - FIGpIIrIJX )I 0'
xOER

So, if c n(a) = c n(a, I) is defined by
Cn(a) = infft: Fl1/211P ((O)_p ((t) 2 1-),
then (3.4) and (3.5) give
(3.6) Fn1/211p _p11(cn(a)) -> 1 - a in pr
and also

(3.7) Pr{n 1/2 Pn - Pjj?< Cn(a)} -* 1 - a.
In conclusion the bootstrap in probability as described above allows the

construction of asymptotic confidence regions for P.
3.1. THEOREM. Assuming F7e M(P), the following are equivalent:

(a) F5e CLT(P).
(b) There exists a centered Gaussian process G on F whose law is Radon in
iX(SF) such that

(3.8) d BLl*(( n1/2(1 ) -Pn(cI))), ,( (G)) 0 inpr*.
If either (a) or (b) holds, then G = Gp, i.e., F satisfies the bootstrapped
CLT(P) in probability.

PROOF. (a) -* (b). Using the decomposition (1.13) in Theorem 1.1.3 from
Gine and Zinn (1986) of

E*H(n1/2(P ((c) -Pn((O))) -EH(G)), H E)
and the bootstrapped CLT in finite dimensions, it follows that, in order to

This gives (3.9), hence (3.8) with G = GP.
(b) => (a). If (b) holds, for every subsequence of %J there is a further subsequence, say {nk} such that

(3.10) d l*( n2 (1$nk ) - PneGi))), 27(G)) 0 co-a.s.
Then, by infinitesimality and Gaussian limits, we have, as in the proof of
Theorem 2.4, for all 8 > 0,

Now, previous arguments show that this limit holds in expectation, i.e.,

(3.12) n Pr{F(X) > 5n1/2} -> 0.
For every subsequence {nk} for which (3.10) holds, we can use (3.11) and the

Then, by the converse CLT (centering part), the truncated centers must

contradiction. We have just proved Ef2(X) <cc, f E A, and

Hence, since every subsequence has a further subsequence {nk} for which this
limit holds, we obtain

3.2. REMARK. A similar result holds in the case of normings an # n1/2 and

Gaussian limits: Fe CLT(P; a) with limit G iff /f {E n= ( X -

Pn(w)( f))/an: f E A} -sew> -/-'(G) in probability. The proof is
that of Theorem 3.1 and is omitted. However, such a result cannot hold in the

case of a stable non-Gaussian limit [Gine and Zinn (1989)].
3.3. REMARK. Note that the proof of Theorem 3.1 is more elementary than
the proof of Theorem 2.4: The deeper Lemma 2.3 is not needed for the
bootstrap in probability.

3.4. REMARK. Beran, Le Cam and Millar (1987) show that whenever a
bootstrapped limit theorem holds in probability, then the empirical distributions of the bootstrapped laws also converge weakly in probability. This
justifies using Monte Carlo simulation to approximate the bootstrapped distributions. Concretely, our Theorem 3.1 and the corollary in Section 4 of their
paper give:

Let V, - n1/2(Pn(w) - Pnn )), which is an i'(S-)-valued random variable,

and for jn ?? cc consider i.i.d. copies of iV, say { j}Jrn1. Then, if F1e CLT(P),
we have

dBL* Z P^ Xo - 0 in probability
In j=1

[in probability refers to (f(in))Jn ? Pr, for each n].

Finally we show that the weak law of large numbers for empirical processes,
can also be bootstrapped in probability. It may be worth mentioning that an
example of F and P for which the WLLN holds but the strong law does not

hold is: P = uniform distribution on [0, 1] F= {w(t)I(o 13: t E (0, 1/2]} wit

decreasing tw(t) -* 0 but JJ"/2w(t) dt = oc, i.e., the weighted empirical proc
[Theorem 7.3 in Andersen, Gine and Zinn (1988)]. Some additional notation

for Theorem 3.5: Given random variables I, 'q, dpr denotes their
Ky Fan distance, which metrizes convergence in probability, dpr(,'Y1) =

inf[e: Pr{I[ - 'ni > e} < 8]. If the random variables involve XW, ej, Nj, t

implies [see the proof of Corollary 2.13 in Gine and Zinn (1984)] that

n Pr(116x1 - 8x,11{ > n) -> 0 as n -> oo.
But then

n Pr(II5xII,-> 2n)Pr(IIlx1IIq-? n) -> 0 as n -> oo
and hence

t Pr(OOX11x9-> t) 0 as t e cc.
Also, from symmetrization procedures [Lemma 2.7, Gine and Zinn (1984)] we

The first term on the right goes to zero since n -> oo. The second term can be
made less than any E > 0 if r (and therefore k) is large enough, since the

WLLN [i.e., (i)] is assumed to hold. Further, since t Pr(II5x1 IIJ>
as t -> oo,

IPfI(F < n)l < f Pr(If(x)II(F(X) < n) > t) dt ?< 1 + ? dt < K'ln n,
