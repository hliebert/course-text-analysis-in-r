Abstract
Applied econometricians frequently apply the inverse hyperbolic sine (or arcsinh) transformation to a variable because it approximates the natural logarithm of that variable and
allows retaining zero-valued observations. We provide derivations of elasticities in common
applications of the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation and show empirically that the
difference in elasticities driven by ad hoc transformations can be substantial. We conclude
by offering practical guidance for applied researchers.

I.

Introduction

Applied econometricians often transform variables to make the interpretation of empirical
results easier, to approximate a normal distribution, to reduce heteroscedasticity, or to
reduce the effect of outliers. Taking the logarithm of a variable has long been a popular
such transformation.
One problem with taking the logarithm of a variable is that it does not allow retaining
zero-valued observations because ln(0) is undeﬁned. But economic data often include
meaningful zero-valued observations, and applied econometricians are typically loath to
drop those observations for which the logarithm is undeﬁned. Consequently, researchers
have often resorted to ad hoc means of accounting for this when taking the natural logarithm
of a variable, such as adding 1 to the variable prior to its transformation (MaCurdy and
Pencavel, 1986).
In recent years, the inverse hyperbolic sine (or arcsinh) transformation has grown in
popularity among applied econometricians because (i) it is similar to a logarithm, and

(ii) it allows retaining zero-valued (and even negative-valued) observations (Burbidge,
Magee and Robb, 1988; MacKinnon and Magee, 1990; Pence, 2006).1
For a random variable x, taking the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation yields a new
variable x̃, such that
√
(1)
x̃ = arcsinh(x) = ln(x + x2 + 1).
The arcsinh transformation is easy to implement, yet there is no formal guidance on how
to compute elasticities when using it, or on how it compares to alternative transformations.2
In this article, we ﬁrst ﬁll this gap. We then provide an empirical illustration that relies on
a widely known and publicly available data set. We conclude by offering guidelines for
applied work, including Stata code to estimate the elasticities we derive in this paper.

II.

Deriving elasticities

In applied work, four common cases might present themselves to the applied econometrician, with each of the following pairs representing a dependent variable–explanatory variable combination: (i) linear–arcsinh, (ii) arcsinh–linear, (iii) arcsinh–linear with a dummy
independent variable, and (iv) arcsinh–arcsinh speciﬁcations. We derive elasticities analytically for each case. A useful preliminary result for what follows is that @@xx̃ = √x12 +1 .
Linear–arcsinh Speciﬁcation

Consider the following estimable equation
y =  + x̃ + .

arcsinh–Linear Speciﬁcation

Now, consider an estimable equation of the form
ỹ =  + x + 

As Ravallion (2017) notes, in cases where a concave log-like transformation of negative data is necessary, the
inverse hyperbolic sine transformation has undesirable properties, viz. it is convex over negative values. Given that,
and because the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation is largely used with nonnegative variables (e.g. earnings), we
focus in this paper only on cases where the variable to which the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation is applied is
nonnegative.

where x is a continuous variable. In this case, to recover y from the left-hand side of the

arcsinh–Linear speciﬁcation with dummy independent variables

Dummy variables pose a different set of problems for calculating elasticities, and this
problem is not unique to arcsinh–linear econometric speciﬁcations. Standard log-linear
speciﬁcations also suffer from this problem (Kennedy, 1981; Halvorsen and Palmquist,
1980). Consider the estimable equation
ỹ =  + d + 

(8)

where d is a dichotomous variable taking on only values of zero or one.The quantity @ỹ/ @d is
undeﬁned because dichotomous variables only change discretely. Following the arguments
of Halvorsen and Palmquist (1980), Kennedy (1981), and Giles (1982) for semilogarithmic
regression equations with dummy variables, we derive the analogous proportional effect
for the arcsinh transformation, which we denote P̄.
To derive P̄, the percentage change in y associated with a change from d = 0 to d = 1,
we ﬁrst apply the sinh transformation to both sides, such that
sinh(ỹ) = y = sinh( + d + ).

(9)

After estimating equation (8), P̄ is then deﬁned as
ˆ − sinh(ˆ + )

ŷ(d = 1) − ŷ(d = 0) sinh(ˆ + ˆ + )

Researchers often adopt the arcsinh transformation to approximate a logarithm and
interpret coefﬁcients as they would for a logarithmic equation. In this case, one can approximate semi-elasticities as shown by Halvorsen and Palmquist (1980), Kennedy (1981),
and Giles (1982) by exponentiating both sides of equation (8) and noting that

properties of natural logarithms, which is a special case. In general, it is important to
include conditioning variables at their sample means in elasticity formulations with nonlogarithmic transformations, such as in equation (8).
arcsinh–arcsinh Speciﬁcation

Now, consider a regression of the form,
ỹ =  + x̃ + .

(13)

In this last case, in order to recover y from the left-hand side of equation (13) after estimating
the same equation, one has to apply the hyperbolic sine transformation on both sides, so
that

y = sinh(ˆ + ˆ x̃ + ).

Caveats

In the literature, the elasticities just derived are interpreted as the elasticities one would
obtain from equivalent speciﬁcations with logarithmic transformations, but this only holds
for large enough average values of x, y, or both. This begs the question of how large is
large enough. We suggest applied econometricians use approximate elasticities for values
of x or y no less than 10. Although this value seems arbitrary, we suggest it because values
greater than 10 reduce approximation error to less than half of a percent. Obviously, greater
thresholds will yield greater accuracy.
Indeed, starting from the equation y =  + x + , wherein yx = xy , multiplying y by
k > 0 will return a coefﬁcient on x equal to k, and the elasticity yx will be such that
@y x
· = kx
, so that yx = xy . Likewise, multiplying x by k will change the coefﬁcient but
@x y
yk
leave the elasticity unaffected. In this linear–linear case, rescaling y or x does not change
the elasticity.
When an arcsinh transformation is involved, however, Monte Carlo simulations show
that yx becomes more stable as k increases. Speciﬁcally, we have generated a data set
containing 1,000 observations on three variables: x ∼ N (10, 2), e ∼ N (0, 2), and y, which
is such that
ky = 5 + 0.5kx + e

(17)

The results of those simulations are shown for values of k equal to 0.001, 0.01, 0.5, 1, 5,
10, 50, 100, 1,000, and 10,000 respectively for the linear–linear, linear–arcsinh, arcsinh–
linear, and arcsinh–arcsinh cases in Table 1. Starting from k = 1, as k gets larger, the
elasticities rapidly become more stable. For k > 10, there is virtually no discernable change
in the elasticity estimates as k increases. Perhaps more interestingly, starting from k = 1,
as k → 0, the elasticities become indistinguishable from the linear-linear case elasticities,
which is another attractive feature of the arcsinh transformation.4
Lastly, recall that applied econometricians often adopt the arcsinh transformation to
deal with variables with zero-valued observations, and the presence of such observations
at low (i.e. zero) values of x or y may result in biased elasticity estimates. In these cases,
researchers should calculate elasticities using the exact formulations derived in equations
(3), (7), and (16). But because
Nall three elasticities are undeﬁned when y = 0, we suggest the
following. Deﬁning ȳ = N1 i=1 yi , one workaround when y = 0 is to multiply by ȳx̄ instead
of by yx , i.e. to report the elasticity at the means of x and y instead of one of the mean
elasticities we derive above.

III.

Empirical illustration

We illustrate common uses of the inverse-hyperbolic sine transformation using data from
Dehejia and Wahba (1999), who evaluated LaLonde’s (1986) canonical design-replication
experiment for the National Supported Work (NSW) demonstration.

Arbitrarily replacing values of x and y by zeros shows that this property of the elasticities involving one or two
arcsinh transformations is robust.

Notes: This table presents elasticity estimates from different empirical speciﬁcations
based on a simulated data set where x ∼ N (10, 2), e ∼ N (0, 2), and ky = 5 + 0.5kx + e
for various values of k.

In that experiment, disadvantaged workers were randomly assigned either to the NSW
program, wherein they were given counseling and work experience, or to the control group,
wherein they received neither of those things. We use the Dehejia and Wahba (1999) subset
of LaLonde’s (1986) original data.
The outcome of interest is post-treatment annual earnings, Earnings78 . Because this
application is for illustrative purposes, we focus on estimating the treatment effect of
the NSW program controlling for pre-treatment earnings only. The inverse hyperbolic
sine transformation of earnings is potentially attractive because earnings data tends to
be right-skewed and there is a nontrivial number of true zeros in the data. As shown in
Table 1, Earnings78 has 45 and 92 zero-valued observations respectively for the treatment
and control groups, with 111 and 178 zero-valued pre-treatment earnings observations
respectively for the treatment and control groups.
We estimate four simple speciﬁcations that capture each of the cases described above,
as well as two models with the oft-used ln(x + 1) transformation for comparison. Results
are presented in Table 2.5
In column (1), we see that the NSW job-training program increased post-treatment
earnings of the treated group by $1,750 per year relative to the control group.This estimate is
illustrative of the estimate in Dehejia and Wahba (1999)Table 3, panel B, row 1. We calculate
a semi-elasticity by dividing the treatment coefﬁcient by the sample mean of the dependent
variable to show that NSW increased earnings of treated individuals by approximately 33%.

Before interpreting our results, we reiterate that this empirical exercise is intended to illustrate how ad hoc
transformations can lead to changes in elasticity interpretations. We include goodness-of-ﬁt statistics for the interested
reader, although choosing the speciﬁcation that ﬁts best is not the purpose of the illustration. Reported log-likelihoods
are adjusted for the fact that we are comparing different dependent variables (i.e. y, ln(y + 1), and arcsinh(y)) by
adding the Jacobian term relevant to each transformation to its respective log-likelihood (MacKinnon and Magee,
1990; Davidson and MacKinnon, 2004).

Only earnings data and treatment indicators are used in this
analysis.

We also calculate the earnings elasticity between pre- and post-treatment earnings, which
shows that as pretreatment earnings increase by 10%, we observe a 0.43% increase in
post-treatment earnings. This elasticity does not have a causal interpretation, although it
is useful for comparing elasticity calculations.
In column (2), we transform pre-treatment earnings using the arcsinh transformation.
This adjustment reduces the earnings elasticity from 0.043 to 0.026, a nearly 40% reduction.
This is a drastic change for a seemingly innocuous transformation of an independent
variable, likely due to having reduced the inﬂuence of outliers (e.g. very high earners on
average) as a result of the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation. The coefﬁcient on NSW,
however, remains stable, suggesting that the arcsinh transformation of a control variable
does not affect causal interpretation of treatment variables and can improve the ﬁt of the
model.
In columns (3) and (4), we repeat this analysis for arcsinh transformation of an independent variable: post-treatment earnings. Here, we see notable deviations from the linear–
arcsinh case. Focusing on the earnings elasticity, we ﬁnd a similar pattern as in columns
(1) and (2): applying the arcsinh transformation to post-treatment earnings reduces the
elasticity estimate by a factor of two. These elasticities, overall, are substantially larger
than that of the linear case. This illustration shows that a transformation of the dependent
variable can have a drastic effect on elasticity estimates.
We also present in columns (3) and (4) semi-elasticity estimates of NSW on earnings
calculated both by exact methods (P̄) and by the logarithmic approximation (P̃). Results
suggest that NSW increased earnings by 158–188%. These results highlight the danger
of interpreting coefﬁcient estimates directly as semi-elasticities for large coefﬁcients on
dummy variables in arcsinh–linear regression equations. In both columns, P̄ is approximately 25 percentage points larger than P̃. This difference stems almost entirely from the
small-sample adjustment in P̃. Because earnings are large in our application, the difference
in P̄ and P̃ before the small-sample adjustment is trivial, suggesting the simpler logarithmic
approximation performs well.
Finally, in columns (5) and (6), we repeat the previous analysis but substitute the ln(x +
1) transformation for the arcsinh transformation. Our results for (Earnings78 , Earnings75 )

Notes: This table presents illustrative regression results using data from the evaluation of the National

and Pischke (2009). Data are obtained from https://economics.mit.edu/faculty/angrist/

randomized treatment group. Earnings78 and Earnings75 are annual earnings (in dollars) for 1978 and 1975, respectively. All (semi-)elasticities are calculated at the sample mean.

are largely analogous to the arcsinh case. This similarity suggests that common transformations of dependent and independent variables with a large proportion of zeros and outliers
can have substantial implications for elasticity estimates. For semi-elasticities, we ﬁnd that
transforming dependent variables by logarithms produces percentage changes about 15–20
percentage points smaller than arcsinh transformations (shown in columns (3) and (4)) in
our application.
We do not take a stand on whether the effect of the NSW program presented in
this sequence of results is the true effect of job-training programs on earnings; that is
not the point of this paper. Rather, we show that under seemingly innocuous, oft-used
transformations of dependent and independent variables, we can produce wildly different elasticity estimates even within a randomized design. We view this simple analysis
as a cautionary warning to applied econometricians about using ad hoc transformations
to deal with zero-valued observations and to facilitate easy interpretation of empirical
results.

Summary and concluding remarks

We have ﬁrst derived exact elasticities in cases where an applied econometrician applies
the increasingly popular inverse hyperbolic sine (or arcsinh) transformation to a variable,
characterizing elasticities for the cases where the arcsinh transformation is applied to (i) an
explanatory variable of interest, (ii) the dependent variable with a continuous explanatory
variable of interest, (iii) the dependent variable with a dichotomous explanatory variable
of interest, and (iv) both the dependent variable and the explanatory variable of interest.
After discussing some of the caveats of our approach, we have derived those elasticities
for a well-known application, which has provided a cautionary tale regarding the use of ad
hoc transformations of variables when dealing with zero-valued observations.
We conclude with the following guidelines for applied researchers who wish to use the
inverse hyperbolic sine transformation in their own work to obtain elasticities:
1. One needs to be careful when interpreting inverse hyperbolic sine coefﬁcients as semielasticities. In most cases, the researcher will need to transform those coefﬁcients in
the manner derived in subsections ‘arcsinh–Linear Speciﬁcation’ and ‘arcsinh–Linear
Speciﬁcation with Dummy Independent Variables’ prior to interpreting them as percentage changes. In our empirical example, interpreting  on NSW as a semi-elasticity
in an arcsinh–linear equation understates the correct percentage effect by 40%.
2. Standard logarithmic adjustments for semi-elasticities in arcsinh–linear equations with
dummy variables can be used with little error for dependent variables with untransformed means roughly greater than 10.
3. Applying the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation to an explanatory variable of interest appears somewhat harmless, but it can change elasticities relative to the linear-linear
model substantially.
4. For cases where the applied researcher is dealing with data that contain too many
zero-valued observations, it is probably better to model the data-generating process
explicitly, e.g. using a Tobit or zero-inﬂated Poisson or negative binomial model.6
Unfortunately, there is no way to know what ‘too many’ means in this context and
so as a rule of thumb, we submit that if the data has more than one third zero-valued
observations, it is perhaps best to explicitly model selection out of zero and into the
positive domain. That rule of thumb, however, is entirely arbitrary, and different authors
might have different preferences as to what ‘too many zero-valued observations’means.
5. It is easy to obtain a more stable elasticity estimate by multiplying the variables by
a constant k > 1. As k increases, the approximation error of the elasticity estimate is
reduced. So for example, one can get more stable estimates by expressing prices in
dollars rather than in thousands of dollars.
6. As with other elasticity estimates that rely on nonlinear combinations of coefﬁcients
and data, standard errors can be obtained either by using the delta method or by boot6

In developing countries, for example, many agricultural producers do not use chemical fertilizer, preferring
instead to use organic fertilizer. In such cases, it is not uncommon to have a data set where roughly half of the
observations report using no chemical fertilizer, and those observations are coded as zeros. In such cases, the applied
econometrician can either explicitly model the data-generating process – say, by estimating a type II Tobit where
the ﬁrst stage looks at whether a producer uses chemical fertilizer and the second stage looks at how much chemical
fertilizer the same producer uses conditional on using it in the ﬁrst place.

strapping. An anonymous reviewer, however, noted that though asymptotically valid,
the delta method does not always work well in small samples, and bootstrap methods
often perform better.
7 In Appendix B, we present Stata code to calculate elasticities in the cases presented
in sections ‘Linear–arcsinh Speciﬁcation’, ‘arcsinh–Linear Speciﬁcation’, ‘arcsinh–
Linear Speciﬁcation with Dummy Independent Variables’ and ‘arcsinh–arcsinh Speciﬁcation’.
Overall, the inverse hyperbolic sine function can be a useful tool for econometricians
using variables with extreme values and true zeros. For large positive values, arcsinh can
generally be treated like a natural logarithm. Future research might consider small-sample
adjustments in the elasticity formulations we have presented here.

Consider the model
arcsinh(y) =  + d + 

To approximate P̄, the percentage change in ŷ due to a change in the dummy variable d,

where the approximation holds for large ŷ.
We then deﬁne the percentage change in ŷ due to a discrete change in d,

Appendix B
In this section, we present Stata code to estimate the elasticities discussed in this paper
for the simple case where there are only two variables: the dependent variable y, and the
explanatory variable of interest x. Before anything else, the following preliminary lines of
code are necessary:
egen xbar = mean(x)
egen ybar = mean(y)
gen ihs x = asinh(x)
gen ihs y = asinh(y)
where xbar and ybar are respectively the means of the explanatory variable of interest
and of the dependent variable, ihs x denotes the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation
x, and ihs y denotes the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation y.

Bulletin

Turning to elasticities, recall that for the standard case, the elasticity can be estimated
as follows:
reg y x
nlcom b[x]*xbar/ybar
Similarly, for the linear-arcsinh case, the elasticity can be estimated as follows:
reg y ihs x
nlcom ( b[ihs x]*xbar)/(ybar*sqrt(xbarˆ2+1))
Likewise, the elasticity for the arcsinh-linear case can be estimated as follows:
reg ihs y x
nlcom b[x]*xbar*((sqrt(ybarˆ2+1))/ybar)
Finally, the elasticity for the arcsinh-arcsinh case can be estimated as follows:
reg ihs y ihs x
nlcom ( b[ihs x]*xbar*(sqrt(ybarˆ2+1)))/(ybar*sqrt(xbarˆ2+1))
In all cases, Stata estimates the standard errors using the delta method.
