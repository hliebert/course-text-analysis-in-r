DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES WITH VARIATION IN TREATMENT TIMING *

Andrew Goodman-Bacon

August 30, 2018

Abstract: The canonical difference-in-differences (DD) model contains two time periods, “pre”
and “post”, and two groups, “treatment” and “control”. Most DD applications, however, exploit
variation across groups of units that receive treatment at different times. This paper derives an
expression for this general DD estimator, and shows that it is a weighted average of all possible
two-group/two-period DD estimators in the data. This result provides detailed guidance about how
to use regression DD in practice. I define the DD estimand and show how it averages treatment
effect heterogeneity and that it is biased when effects change over time. I propose a new balance
test derived from a unified definition of common trends. I show how to decompose the difference
between two specifications, and I apply it to models that drop untreated units, weight, disaggregate
time fixed effects, control for unit-specific time trends, or exploit a third difference.

Difference-in-differences (DD) is both the most common and the oldest quasi-experimental
research design, dating back to Snow’s (1855) analysis of a London cholera outbreak. 1 A DD
estimate is the difference between the change in outcomes before and after a treatment (difference

treatment group dummy and a post-treatment period dummy in the following regression:

The elegance of DD makes it clear which comparisons generate the estimate, what leads to bias,
and how to test the design. The expression in terms of sample means connects the regression to
potential outcomes and shows that, under a common trends assumption, a two-group/two-period
(2x2) DD identifies the average treatment effect on the treated. All econometrics textbooks and
survey articles describe this structure, 2 and recent methodological extensions build on it. 3
Most DD applications diverge from this 2x2 set up though because treatments usually occur
at different times. 4 The processes that generate treatment variables naturally lead to variation in
timing. Local governments change policy. Jurisdictions hand down legal rulings. Natural disasters
strike across seasons. Firms lay off workers. In this case researchers estimate a regression with
dummies for cross-sectional units (𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 ) and time periods (𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 ), and a treatment dummy (𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ):
𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

In contrast to our substantial understanding of the canonical 2x2 DD model, we know
relatively little about the two-way fixed effects DD model when treatment timing varies. We do
not know precisely how it compares mean outcomes across groups. 5 We typically rely on general
descriptions of the identifying assumption like “interventions must be as good as random,
conditional on time and group fixed effects” (Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan 2004, p. 250),
and consequently lack well-defined strategies to test the validity of the DD design with timing. We
have limited understanding of the treatment effect parameter that regression DD identifies. Finally,
we often cannot evaluate when alternative specifications will work or why they change estimates. 6
This paper shows that the two-way fixed effects DD estimator in (2) is a weighted average
of all possible 2x2 DD estimators that compare timing groups to each other. Some use units treated
at a particular time as the treatment group and untreated units as the control group. Some compare
units treated at two different times, using the later group as a control before its treatment begins
and then the earlier group as a control after its treatment begins. As in any least squares estimator,
the weights on the 2x2 DD’s are proportional to group sizes and the variance of the treatment
dummy within each pair. Treatment variance is highest for groups treated in the middle of the
panel and lowest for groups treated at the extremes. This result clarifies the theoretical
interpretation and identifying assumptions of the general DD model and creates simple new tools
for describing the design and analyzing problems that arise in practice.
By decomposing the DD estimator into its sources of variation (the 2x2 DD’s) and
providing an explicit interpretation of the weights in terms of treatment variances, my results

Imai, Kim, and Wang (2018) note “It is well known that the standard DiD estimator is numerically equivalent to the
linear two-way fixed effects regression estimator if there are two time periods and the treatment is administered to
some units only in the second time period. Unfortunately, this equivalence result does not generalize to the multiperiod DiD design…Nevertheless, researchers often motivate the use of the two-way fixed effects estimator by
referring to the DiD design (e.g., Angrist and Pischke, 2009).”
6
This often leads to sharp disagreements. See Neumark, Salas, and Wascher (2014) on unit-specific linear trends, Lee
and Solon (2011) on weighting and outcome transformations, and Shore-Sheppard (2009) on age time fixed effects.

extend recent research on DD models with heterogeneous effects. 7 Assuming equal counterfactual
trends, Abraham and Sun (2018), Borusyak and Jaravel (2017), and de Chaisemartin and
D’HaultfŒuille (2018b) show that two-way fixed effects DD yields an average of treatment effects
across all groups and times, some of which may have negative weights. My results show how these
weights arise from differences in timing and thus treatment variances, facilitating a connection
between models of treatment allocation and the interpretation of DD estimates. 8 I also explain why
the negative weights occur: when already-treated units act as controls, changes in their treatment
effects over time get subtracted from the DD estimate. This negative weighting only arises when
treatment effects vary over time, in which case it typically biases regression DD estimates away
from the sign of the true treatment effect. This does not imply a failure of the underlying design,
but it does caution against the use of a single-coefficient two-way fixed effects specification to
summarize time-varying effects.
I also show that because regression DD uses group sizes and treatment variances to weight
up simple estimates that each rely on common trends between two groups, its identifying
assumption is a variance-weighted version of common trends between all groups. The extent to
which a group’s differential trend biases the overall estimate equals the difference between how
much weight it gets when it acts as the treatment group and how much weight it gets when it acts
as the control group. When the earliest and/or latest treated units have low treatment variance, they
can get more weight as controls than treatments. In designs without untreated units they always

7

Early research in this area made specific observations about stylized specifications such as models with no unit fixed
effects (Bitler, Gelbach, and Hoynes 2003), or it provided simulation evidence (Meer and West 2013).
8
Related results on the weighting of heterogeneous treatment effects does not provide this intuition. Abraham and
Sun (2018, p 9) describe the weights in a DD estimate with constant treatment effects as “residual[s] from predicting
treatment status, 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 with unit and time fixed effects.” de Chaisemartin and D’HaultfŒuille (2018b, p 7) and Borusyak
and Jaravel (2017) describe these same weights as coming from an auxiliary regression and Borusyak and Jaravel
(2017, p 10-11) note that “a general characterization of [the weights] does not seem feasible.” Athey and Imbens
(2018) also decompose the DD estimator and develop design-based inference methods for this setting. Strezhnev
(2018) expresses 𝛽𝛽̂ 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 as an unweighted average of DD-type terms across pairs of observations and periods.

do. These weights, derived from the estimator itself, form the basis of a new balance test that
generalizes the traditional notion of balance between treatment and control groups, and improves
on existing strategies that test between treated/untreated units or early/later treated units.
Finally, I use the weighted average result to develop simple tools to describe the general
DD design and evaluate why estimates change across specifications. Simply plotting the 2x2 DD’s
against their weight displays heterogeneity in the estimated components and shows which terms
or groups matter most. Summing the weights on the timing comparisons versus treated/untreated
comparisons quantifies “how much” of the variation comes from timing (a common question in
practice). Additionally, the difference between DD estimates across specifications can often be
written as a Oaxaca-Blinder-Kitagawa style decomposition allowing researchers to calculate how
much comes from the 2x2 DD’s, the weights, or the interaction of the two. The source of instability
matters because changes due to different weighting reflect changes in the estimand (not bias),
while changes in the 2x2 DD’s suggest that covariates address confounding. Scatter plots of the
2x2 DD’s (or the weights) from different specifications show which specific terms drive these
differences. I develop this approach for models that weight, use triple-differences, control for unitspecific time trends (or pre-trends only), and control for disaggregated time fixed effects.
To demonstrate these methods I replicate Stevenson and Wolfers (2006) two-way fixed
effects DD study of the effect of unilateral divorce laws on female suicide rates. The two-way
fixed effects model suggest that unilateral divorce leads to 3 fewer suicides per million women.
More than a third of the identifying variation comes from treatment timing and the rest comes from
comparisons to states with no reforms during the sample period. Event-study estimates show that
the treatment effects vary strongly over time, however, which biases many of the timing
comparisons. The DD estimate (-3.08) is therefore a misleading summary estimate of the average

4

post-treatment effect, which is closer to -5. My proposed balance test detects significantly higher
per-capita income and male/female sex ratios in reform states, in contrast to joint tests of covariate
balance across timing groups, which cannot reject the null of balance. Finally, my results show
that much of the sensitivity across specifications comes from changes in weights, or a small
number of 2x2 DD’s, and need not indicate bias.

THE DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES DECOMPOSITION THEOREM

When units experience treatment at different times, one cannot estimate equation (1) because the
post-period dummy is not defined for control observations. Nearly all work that exploits variation
in treatment timing uses the two-way fixed effects model in equation (2) (Cameron and Trivedi
2005 pg. 738). Researchers clearly recognize that differences in when units received treatment
contribute to identification, but have not been able to describe how these comparisons are made. 9
The simplest way to illustrate how treatment timing works is to consider a balanced panel
dataset with 𝑇𝑇 periods (𝑡𝑡) and 𝑁𝑁 cross-sectional units (𝑖𝑖) that belong to either an untreated group,
𝑈𝑈; an early treatment group, 𝑘𝑘, which receives a binary treatment at 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘∗ ; and a late treatment group,
ℓ, which receives the binary treatment at 𝑡𝑡ℓ∗ > 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘∗ . Figure 1 plots this structure.

Throughout the paper I use “group” or “timing group” to refer to collections of units either

treated at the same time or not treated. I refer to units that do not receive treatment as “untreated”
rather than “control” units because, while they obviously act as controls, treated units do, too. 𝑘𝑘

will denote an earlier treated group and ℓ will denote a later treated group. Each group’s sample

�𝑘𝑘 . I use 𝑦𝑦𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(𝑎𝑎) to denote the sample mean
share is 𝑛𝑛𝑘𝑘 and the share of time it spends treated is 𝐷𝐷

𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(𝑎𝑎)

of 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 for units in group 𝑏𝑏 during group 𝑎𝑎’s post period, [𝑡𝑡𝑎𝑎∗ , 𝑇𝑇]. (𝑦𝑦𝑏𝑏

is defined similarly.)

Angrist and Pischke (2015), for example, lay out the canonical DD model in terms of means, but discuss regression
DD with timing in general terms only, noting that there is “more than one…experiment” in this setting.

The challenge in this setting has been to articulate how estimates of equation (2) compare
the groups and times depicted in figure 1. We do, however, have clear intuition, for 2x2 designs in
which one group’s treatment status changes and another’s does not. We could form several such
designs, estimable by equation (1), in the three-group case. Figure 2 plots them.
Panels A and B show that with only one of the two treatment groups, an estimate from
equation (2) reduces to the canonical case comparing a treated to an untreated group:
� 2𝑥𝑥2 ≡ �𝑦𝑦𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(𝑗𝑗) − 𝑦𝑦𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(𝑗𝑗) � − �𝑦𝑦𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(𝑗𝑗) − 𝑦𝑦𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(𝑗𝑗) � , 𝑗𝑗 = 𝑘𝑘, ℓ .

If instead there were no untreated units, the two way fixed effects estimator would be identified
only by the differential treatment timing between groups 𝑘𝑘 and ℓ. For this case, panels C and D
plot two clear 2x2 DD’s based on sub-periods when only one group’s treatment status changes.

Before 𝑡𝑡ℓ∗ , the early units act as the treatment group because their treatment status changes, and

later units act as controls during their pre-period. We compare outcomes between the window

when treatment status varies, 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(𝑘𝑘, ℓ), and group 𝑘𝑘’s pre-period, 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(𝑘𝑘):

The opposite situation, shown in panel D, arises after 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘∗ when the later group changes treatment

status but the early group does not. Later units act as the treatment group, early units act as controls,
and we compare average outcomes between the periods 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(ℓ) and 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(𝑘𝑘, ℓ):

The already-treated units in group 𝑘𝑘 can serve as controls even though they are treated because
treatment status does not change.

My central result is that any two-way fixed effects DD estimator is a weighted average of
well-understood 2x2 DD estimators, like those plotted in figure 2. To see why, first assume a

The appendix shows how to simplify this covariance using the binary nature of 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , and by

Theorem 1 completely describes the sources of identifying variation in a general DD model
and their importance. With 𝐾𝐾 timing groups, one could form 𝐾𝐾 2 − 𝐾𝐾 “timing-only” estimates that

The weights come both from group sizes, via the 𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗 ’s, and the treatment variance in each

Many other least-squares estimators weight heterogeneity this way. A univariate regression coefficient equals an
average of coefficients in mutually exclusive (and demeaned) subsamples weighted by size and the subsample 𝑥𝑥 variance:

Similarly, the Wald/IV theorem (Angrist 1988) shows that any IV estimate is a linear combination of Wald estimators
that compare two values of the instrument. Gibbons, Serrato, and Urbancic (2018) show a nearly identical weighting
formula for one-way fixed effects. Panel data provide another well-known example: a pooled regression coefficients
equals a variance-weighted average of two distinct estimators that each use less information: the between estimator
for subsample means, and the within estimator for deviations from subsample means.

This decomposition theorem also shows how DD compares groups treated at different

times. A two-group “timing-only” estimator is itself a weighted average of the 2x2 DD’s plotted

0.58(1 − 0.58) = 0.244. This puts less weight on terms where 𝑘𝑘 is the treatment group (𝑠𝑠𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 = 0.24 and 𝑠𝑠𝑘𝑘ℓ 𝜇𝜇𝑘𝑘ℓ =
0.07) and more weight on terms where ℓ is the treatment group (𝑠𝑠ℓ𝑈𝑈 = 0.43 and 𝑠𝑠𝑘𝑘ℓ (1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑘𝑘ℓ ) = 0.26).

Two recent papers present clear analyses using two-group timing-only estimators. Malkova (2017) studies a

THEORY: WHAT PARAMETER DOES DD IDENTIFY AND UNDER WHAT ASSUMPTIONS?

Theorem 1 relates the regression DD coefficient to sample averages, which makes it simple to
analyze its statistical properties by writing 𝛽𝛽̂ 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 in terms of potential outcomes (Holland 1986,
Rubin 1974). The outcome is 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖1 + (1 − 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 )𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖0 , where 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖1 is unit 𝑖𝑖’s treated outcome at

time 𝑡𝑡, and 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖0 is the corresponding untreated outcome. Following Callaway and Sant'Anna (2018,
p 7) define the ATT for timing group 𝑘𝑘 at time 𝜏𝜏 (the “group-time average treatment effect”):

𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 (𝜏𝜏) ≡ 𝐸𝐸[𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖1 − 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖0 �𝑘𝑘, 𝑡𝑡 = 𝜏𝜏]. Because regression DD averages outcomes in pre- and post-

periods, I define the average of the 𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 (𝜏𝜏) in a date range, 𝑊𝑊:

𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 (𝑊𝑊) ≡ 𝐸𝐸[𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖1 − 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖0 �𝑘𝑘, 𝑡𝑡 ∈ 𝑊𝑊]

(9)

In practice, 𝑊𝑊 will represent post-treatment windows that appear in the 2x2 components. Finally,
define the difference over time in average potential outcomes (treated or untreated) as:
Δ𝑌𝑌𝑘𝑘ℎ (𝑊𝑊1 , 𝑊𝑊0 ) ≡ 𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ �𝑘𝑘, 𝑊𝑊1� − 𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ �𝑘𝑘, 𝑊𝑊0 �,

ℎ = 0,1

(10)

Applying this notation to the 2x2 DD’s in equations (3)-(5), adding and subtracting post-period
counterfactual outcomes for the treatment group yields the familiar result that (the probability limit
of) each 2x2 DD equals an ATT plus bias from differential trends:

− �𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 �𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(ℓ)� − 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 �𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(𝑘𝑘, ℓ)��

(11𝑐𝑐)

Note that the definition of common trends in (11a) and (11b) involves only counterfactual
outcomes, but in (11c) identification of 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇ℓ (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(ℓ)) involves counterfactual outcomes and
changes in treatment effects in the already-treated “control group”.

10

Substituting equations (11a)-(11c) into the DD decomposition theorem expresses the
probability limit of the two-way fixed effects DD estimator (assuming that 𝑇𝑇 is fixed and 𝑁𝑁 grows)
in terms of potential outcomes and separates the estimand from the identifying assumptions:
𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 𝛽𝛽̂ 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 = 𝛽𝛽 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 = 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 + 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 + Δ𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴

(12)

𝑁𝑁→∞

The first term in (12) is the two-way fixed effects DD estimand, which I call the “varianceweighted average treatment effect on the treated” (VWATT):
𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 ≡ � 𝜎𝜎𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 �𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(𝑘𝑘)�
𝑘𝑘≠𝑈𝑈

+ � � 𝜎𝜎𝑘𝑘ℓ �𝜇𝜇𝑘𝑘ℓ 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 �𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(𝑘𝑘, ℓ)� + (1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑘𝑘ℓ )𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇ℓ �𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(ℓ)��
𝑘𝑘≠𝑈𝑈 ℓ>𝑘𝑘

(12𝑎𝑎)

The 𝜎𝜎 terms correspond to the 𝑠𝑠 terms in equation (7), but replace sample shares (𝑛𝑛) with
population shares (𝑛𝑛𝑘𝑘∗ ). 14 VWATT is always a positively weighted average of ATTs for the units

and periods that act as treatment groups across the 2x2 DD’s that make up 𝛽𝛽̂ 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 . The weights come

from the decomposition theorem and reflect group size and treatment variance.

The second term, which I call “variance-weighted common trends” (VWCT) generalizes
common trends to a setting with timing variation:
𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 ≡ � 𝜎𝜎𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 �Δ𝑌𝑌𝑘𝑘0 �𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(𝑘𝑘), 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(𝑘𝑘)� − Δ𝑌𝑌𝑈𝑈0 �𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(𝑘𝑘), 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(𝑘𝑘)��

14

(12𝑏𝑏)

Note that a DD estimator is not consistent if 𝑇𝑇 gets large because the permanently turned on treatment dummy
𝑋𝑋 ′𝑋𝑋

becomes collinear with the unit fixed effects (
does not converge to a positive definite matrix). Asymptotics with
𝑇𝑇
respect to 𝑇𝑇 require the time dimension to grow in both directions (see Perron 2006).

11

Like VWATT, VWCT is also an average of the difference in untreated potential outcome trends
between pair of groups (and over different time periods) using the weights from the decomposition
theorem. VWCT is new, it defines internal validity for the DD design with timing, and it is weaker
than the more commonly assumed equal counterfactual trends across groups.
The last term in (12) equals a weighted sum of the change in treatment effects within each
unit’s post-period:
Δ𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 ≡ � � 𝜎𝜎𝑘𝑘ℓ (1 − 𝜇𝜇𝑘𝑘ℓ )�𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 �𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(ℓ)� − 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 �𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(𝑘𝑘, ℓ)��
𝑘𝑘≠𝑈𝑈 ℓ>𝑘𝑘

(12𝑐𝑐)

Because already-treated groups sometimes act as controls, the 2x2 estimators in equation (11c)
subtract average changes in their untreated outcomes and their treatment effects. Equation (12c)
defines the bias that comes from estimating a single-coefficient DD model when treatment effects
vary over time. Note that this does not mean that the DD research design is invalid. In this case
other specifications, such as an event-study model (Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan 1993) or
“stacked DD” (Abraham and Sun 2018, Deshpande and Li 2017, Fadlon and Nielsen 2015), or
other estimators such as reweighting strategies (Callaway and Sant'Anna 2018, de Chaisemartin
and D’HaultfŒuille 2018b) may be more appropriate.
Recent DD research comes to related conclusions about DD models with timing, but does not
describe the full estimator as in equation (12). Abraham and Sun (2018), Borusyak and Jaravel
(2017), and de Chaisemartin and D’HaultfŒuille (2018b) begin by imposing pairwise common
trends (VWCT=0), and then incorporating Δ𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 into the DD estimand. 15 The structure of the

decomposition theorem, however, suggests that we should think of Δ𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 as a source of bias

15
Abraham and Sun (2018, p 6) assume “parallel trends in baseline outcome”; Borusyak and Jaravel (2017, p 10)
assume “no pre-trends”; and de Chaisemartin and D’HaultfŒuille (2018b, p 6) assume “common trends” in
counterfactual outcomes. Two of these papers analyze common specifications that I do not consider. de Chaisemartin
and D’HaultfŒuille (2018b) discuss designs where treatment evolves continuously within group-by-time cells and
first-difference specifications. Abraham and Sun (2018) analyze the estimand for semi-parametric event-study models.

12

because it arises from the way equation (2) forms “the” control group. This distinction, made clear
in equation (12), ensures an interpretable estimand (VWATT) and clearly defined identifying
assumptions. 16 This follows from at least two related precedents. de Chaisemartin and
D’HaultfŒuille (2018a, p. 5) prove identification of dose-response DD models under the
assumption that “the average effect of going from 0 to d units of treatment among units with
D(0)=d is stable over time.” Treatment effect homogeneity ensures an estimand with no negative
weights. Similarly, the monotonicity assumption in Imbens and Angrist (1994) ensures that the
local average treatment effect does not have negative weights. In other words, negative weights
are a failure of identification rather than a feature of the IV estimand.
A. Interpreting the DD Estimand
When the treatment effect is a constant, 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 (𝑊𝑊) = 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴, Δ𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 = 0, and 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 = 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴. The
rest of this section assumes that VWCT=0 and discusses how to interpret VWATT under different

forms of treatment effect heterogeneity.
i.

Effects that vary across units but not over time

If treatment effects are constant over time but vary across units, then 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 (𝑊𝑊) = 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 and we

still have Δ𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 = 0. In this case DD identifies:

≡ 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝑇𝑇

(13)

Equation (12) shows that the negative weighting pointed out elsewhere only occurs when treatment effects vary
over time. The mapping between (12) and existing decompositions can be made explicit by rewriting all the 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 (𝑊𝑊)
terms (see equation 9) in terms of group-time effects, which are the object of, for example, Theorem 1 in de
Chaisemartin and D’HaultfŒuille (2018b). In general, each group-time effect receives a total amount of weight that
comes partly from strictly positive terms (equation 12b) and some from potentially negative terms (equation 12c).
When treatment effects are constant, though, the negative weights in (12c) on the group-time effects in
𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 �𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(𝑘𝑘, ℓ)� cancel with the positive weights on group-time effects in 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 �𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(ℓ)�. Then Δ𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 = 0 and
DD estimates VWATT, which has strictly positive weights.

13

VWATT weights together the group-specific ATTs not by sample shares, but by a function of
sample shares and treatment variance. The weights in (13) equal the sum of the decomposition
weights for all the terms in which group 𝑘𝑘 acts as the treatment group, defined as 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝑇𝑇 .

The parameter in (13) does not necessarily have a structural interpretation. In general,

𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝑇𝑇 ≠ 𝑛𝑛𝑘𝑘∗ , so the parameter does not equal the sample ATT. 17 Neither are the weights proportional
to the share of time each unit spends under treatment, so VWATT also does not equal the effect in
the average treated period. The weights, specifically the central role of treatment variance, comes
from the use of least squares. OLS combines 2x2 DD’s efficiently by weighting them according
to variances of the treatment dummy. 18 VWATT lies along the bias/variance tradeoff: the weights
deliver efficiency by potentially moving the point estimate away from, say, the sample ATT.
This tradeoff may not be worthwhile, particularly when VWATT differs strongly from a
given parameter of interest, which occurs when treatment effect heterogeneity is correlated with
treatment timing. Therefore, the processes that determine treatment timing are central to the
interpretation of VWATT (see Besley and Case 2002). For example, a Roy model of selection on
gains (where the number of units treated in each period is constrained) implies that treatment rolls
out first to units with the largest effects. Site selection in experimental evaluations of training
programs (Joseph Hotz, Imbens, and Mortimer 2005) and energy conservation programs (Allcott
2015) matches this pattern. In this case, regression DD underestimates the sample-weighted ATT
�1 is very small and 𝐷𝐷
�𝐾𝐾 ≈ 0.5,
if 𝑡𝑡1∗ is early enough (or there are a lot of “post” periods) so that 𝐷𝐷

17
Abraham and Sun (2018), Borusyak and Jaravel (2017), Chernozhukov et al. (2013), de Chaisemartin and
D’HaultfŒuille (2018b), Gibbons, Serrato, and Urbancic (2018), Wooldridge (2005) all make a similar observation.
The DD decomposition theorem, provides a new solution for the relevant weights.
18
This is exactly analogous to the result that two-stage least squares is the estimator that “efficient combines alternative
Wald estimates” (Angrist 1991).

14

�𝐾𝐾 is small. The opposite conclusions follow from “reverse Roy” selection where units with the
𝐷𝐷
smallest effects select into treatment first, which describes the take up of housing vouchers (Chyn
forthcoming) and charter school applications (Walters forthcoming).
An easy way to gauge whether VWATT and a sample-weighted ATT is to scatter the
weights from (13) against each group’s sample share. These two may be close if there is little
variation in treatment timing, if the untreated group is very large, or if some timing groups are very
large. Conversely, weighting matters less if the 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 ’s are similar, which one can evaluate by
aggregating each group’s 2x2 DD estimates from the decomposition theorem. 19 Finally, one could
directly compare VWATT to point estimates of a particular parameter of interest. Several
alternative estimators can deliver differently weighted averages of ATT’s (Abraham and Sun 2018,
Callaway and Sant'Anna 2018, de Chaisemartin and D’HaultfŒuille 2018b).
ii.

Effects that vary over time but not across units

Time-varying treatment effects (even if they are identical across units) generate cross-group
heterogeneity in VWATT by averaging time-varying effects over different post-treatment
windows, but more importantly they mean that Δ𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 ≠ 0. Equations (11b) and (11c) show that

common trends in counterfactual outcomes leaves one set of timing terms biased (𝛽𝛽̂𝑘𝑘ℓ

2𝑥𝑥2,𝑘𝑘
common trends between counterfactual and treated outcomes leaves the other set biased (𝛽𝛽̂𝑘𝑘ℓ
).

To illustrate this point, figure 3 plots a case where counterfactual outcomes are identical,

but the treatment effect is a linear trend-break, 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖1 = 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖0 + 𝜙𝜙 ⋅ (𝑡𝑡 − 𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖∗ + 1) (see Meer and West

2𝑥𝑥2,𝑘𝑘
2013). 𝛽𝛽̂𝑘𝑘ℓ
uses group ℓ as a control group during its pre-period and identifies the ATT during

19

Relatedly, de Chaisemartin and D’HaultfŒuille (2018b) derive a statistic that gives the minimum variation in
treatment effects that could lead to wrong-signed regression estimates when all treatment effects have the same sign.

(15)

The entire two-group timing estimate can be wrong signed if 𝜇𝜇𝑘𝑘ℓ is small (putting more weight on

the downward biased term). In figure 3, for example, both units are treated equally close to the
𝜙𝜙

ends of the panel, so 𝜇𝜇𝑘𝑘ℓ = 0.5 and the estimated DD effect equals 2 , even though both units

experience treatment effects as large as 𝜙𝜙 ⋅ [𝑇𝑇 − (𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘∗ − 1)]. This type of bias affects the overall

DD estimate according to the weights in equation (7). It is smaller when there are untreated units,
more so when these units are large.
Note that this bias is specific to the specification in equation (2). More flexible event-study
specifications may not suffer from this problem (although see Proposition 2 in Abraham and Sun

The average of the effects for group 𝑘𝑘 during any set of positive event-times is just 𝜙𝜙 times the average event-time.
The 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(𝑘𝑘, ℓ) period contains event-times 0 through 𝑡𝑡ℓ∗ − 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘∗ − 1 and the 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(ℓ) period contains event-times 𝑡𝑡ℓ∗ −
(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘∗ − 1) through 𝑇𝑇 − (𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘∗ − 1)), so we have:
(𝑡𝑡ℓ∗ − 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘∗ )(𝑡𝑡ℓ∗ − 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘∗ + 1)

2
And the difference, which appears in the identifying assumption in (11c) equals:
𝑇𝑇 − 𝑡𝑡ℓ∗ + 2
𝑡𝑡ℓ∗ − 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘∗ + 1 𝜙𝜙

= �𝑇𝑇 − (𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘∗ − 1)�
𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 �𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(ℓ)� − 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 �𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(𝑘𝑘, ℓ)� = 𝜙𝜙(𝑡𝑡ℓ∗ − 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘∗ ) + 𝜙𝜙
2
2
2
Another way to see this, as noted in figure 3, is that average outcomes in the treatment group are always below average
outcomes in the early group in the 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(ℓ) period and the difference equals the maximum size of the treatment effect
in group 𝑘𝑘 at the end of the 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(𝑘𝑘, ℓ) period: 𝜙𝜙 ⋅ (𝑡𝑡ℓ∗ − 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘∗ + 1). Average outcomes for the late group are also below
average outcomes in the early group in the 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(𝑘𝑘, ℓ) period, but by the average amount of the treatment effect in
20

(𝑡𝑡 ∗ −𝑡𝑡 ∗ +1)

group 𝑘𝑘 during the 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(𝑘𝑘, ℓ) period: 𝜙𝜙 ℓ 𝑘𝑘 . Outcomes in group ℓ actually fall on average relative to group 𝑘𝑘,

which makes the DD estimate negative even when all treatment effects are positive.

2018). Fadlon and Nielsen (2015) and Deshpande and Li (2017) use a novel estimator that matches
treated units with controls that receive treatment a given amount of time later. This specification

does not use already treated units as controls, and yields an average of 𝛽𝛽
𝑘𝑘ℓ

terms with a fixed

post-period. Callaway and Sant'Anna (2018) discuss how to summarize heterogeneous treatment
effects in this context and develop a reweighting estimator to do so. Summarizing time-varying
effects using equation (2), however, yields estimates that are too small or even wrong-signed, and
should not be used to judge the meaning or plausibility of effect sizes. 21
B. What is the identifying assumption and how should we test it?
The preceding analysis maintained the assumption of equal counterfactual trends across groups,
but (12) shows that (as long as treatment effects do not vary over time) identification of VWATT
only requires VWCT to equal zero. The assumption itself is untestable because we cannot, for
example, observe changes in 𝑌𝑌 0 that occur after treatment or test for them using pre-treatment

data. 22 Assuming that differential counterfactual trends, 𝛥𝛥𝑌𝑌𝑘𝑘0 , are linear throughout the panel leads
to a convenient approximation to VWCT: 23

𝑘𝑘≠𝑈𝑈

(16)

21
Borusyak and Jaravel (2017) show that that common, linear trends, in the post- and pre- periods cannot be estimated
in this design. The decomposition theorem shows why: timing groups act as controls for each other, so permanent
common trends difference out. This is not a meaningful limitation for treatment effect estimation, though, because
“effects” must occur after treatment. Job displacement provides a clear example (Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan
1993, Krolikowski 2017). Comparisons based on displacement timing cannot identify whether all displaced workers
have a permanently different earnings trajectory than never displaced workers (the unidentified linear component),
but they can identify changes in the time-path of earnings around the displacement event (the treatment effect).
22
One can use time-varying confounders as outcomes (Freyaldenhoven, Hansen, and Shapiro 2018, Pei, Pischke, and
Schwandt 2017), but this does not test for balance in levels, nor can it be used for sparsely measured confounders.
23
The path of counterfactual outcomes can affect each 2x2 DD’s bias term in different ways. Linearly trending
unobservables, for example, lead to larger bias in 2x2 DD’s that use more periods. I show in the appendix that in the
linear case differences in the magnitude of the bias cancel out across each group’s “treatment” and “control” terms,
and equation (16) holds.

17

Equation (16) generalizes the definition of common trends and collapses to the typical pairwise
common trends assumption for any two-group estimator. It is immediately clear that identical
trends across all groups satisfies (16), but this is not a necessary condition for it to hold since the
bias induced by a given group’s trend depends on the weights in brackets. 24
Fortunately, the weights have an intuitive interpretation. The weight on each group’s
counterfactual trend equals the difference between the total weight it gets when it acts as a
treatment group—𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝑇𝑇 from equation (13)—minus the total weight it gets when it acts as a control
group—𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝐶𝐶 . 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 can therefore be written as:

� Δ𝑌𝑌𝑘𝑘0 [𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝑇𝑇 − 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝐶𝐶 ] = 0
𝑘𝑘

(17)

� (assuming equal group sizes). Units treated in the
Figure 4 plots 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝑇𝑇 − 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝐶𝐶 as a function of 𝐷𝐷
middle of the panel have high treatment variance and get a lot of weight when they act as the
treatment group, while units treated toward the ends of the panel get relatively more weight when
they act as controls. As 𝑡𝑡 ∗ moves closer to 1 or T, 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝑇𝑇 − 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝐶𝐶 becomes negative, which shows that

some timing groups effectively act as controls. This helps define “the” control group in timingonly designs (the dashed line in figure 6): all groups are controls in some terms, but the earliest
and/or latest units necessarily get more weight as controls than treatments. The weights also map
differential trends to bias. 25 A positive trend in group 𝑘𝑘 induces positive bias when 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝑇𝑇 − 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝐶𝐶 > 0,

negative bias when 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝑇𝑇 − 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝐶𝐶 < 0 (that is, if 𝑘𝑘 is an effective control group), and no bias when
𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝑇𝑇 − 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝐶𝐶 = 0. The size of the bias from a given trend is larger for groups with more weight.
24

Callaway and Sant'Anna (2018) provide alternative definitions of common trends and tests not based on linearity.
Applications typically discuss bias in general terms, arguing that unobservables must be “uncorrelated” with timing,
but have not been able to specify how counterfactual trends would bias a two-way fixed effects estimate. For example,
Almond, Hoynes, and Schanzenbach (2011, p 389-190) argue: “Counties with strong support for the low-income
population (such as northern, urban counties with large populations of poor) may adopt FSP earlier in the period. This
systematic variation in food stamp adoption could lead to spurious estimates of the program impact if those same
county characteristics are associated with differential trends in the outcome variables.”

25

18

Equation (17) also shows exactly how to weight together averages of 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and perform a

single 𝑡𝑡-test that directly captures the identifying assumption. Generate a dummy for the effective

treatment group, 𝐵𝐵𝑘𝑘 = 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝑇𝑇 − 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝐶𝐶 > 0, then regress timing-group means, 𝑥𝑥𝑘𝑘 , on 𝐵𝐵𝑘𝑘 weighting by
�𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝑇𝑇 − 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝐶𝐶 �. The coefficient on 𝐵𝐵𝑘𝑘 equals covariate differences weighted by the actual identifying

variation, and its t-statistic tests the null of reweighted balance in (17). One can also use this
strategy to test for pre-treatment trends in confounders (or the outcome) by regressing 𝑥𝑥̅𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 on 𝐵𝐵𝑘𝑘 ,

year dummies, and their interaction, or the interaction of 𝐵𝐵𝑘𝑘 with a linear trend using dates before
any treatment starts. 26

The reweighted balance test has advantages over other strategies for testing balance in this
setting. Regressing 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 on a constant and dummies for timing groups allows a test of the null of
joint balance across groups (𝐻𝐻0 : 𝑥𝑥𝑘𝑘 − 𝑥𝑥𝑈𝑈 = 0, ∀𝑘𝑘 ∈ 𝐾𝐾). With many timing groups, however, this
F-test will have low power, it does not reflect the importance of each group (𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝑇𝑇 − 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝐶𝐶 ), and does

not show the sign or magnitude of any imbalance. 27 The reweighted test, on the other hand, has
higher power and describes the sign and magnitude of imbalance. It is also better than a test for
linear relationships between 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘∗ or tests for balance between “early” and “late” treated units

(Almond, Hoynes, and Schanzenbach 2011, Bailey and Goodman-Bacon 2015). Because the
effective control group can include both the earliest and latest treated units, failing to find a linear
relationship between 𝑥𝑥𝑘𝑘 and 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘∗ can miss the relevant imbalance between the most important

“middle” units and the end points.

26

Plotting confounders or pre-trends across groups, however, is important to ensure that a failure to reject does not
reflect offsetting trends or covariate means across timing groups.
27
Note that using an event-study specification to evaluate pre-trends does not test for joint equality of pre-trends
either. It tests for common trends using the (heretofore unarticulated) estimator itself.

III.

DD DECOMPOSITION IN PRACTICE: UNILATERAL DIVORCE AND FEMALE SUICIDE

To illustrate how to use DD decomposition theorem in practice, I replicate Stevenson and Wolfers’
(2006) analysis of no-fault divorce reforms and female suicide. Unilateral (or no-fault) divorce
allowed either spouse to end a marriage, redistributing property rights and bargaining power
relative to fault-based divorce regimes. Stevenson and Wolfers exploit “the natural variation
resulting from the different timing of the adoption of unilateral divorce laws” in 37 states from
1969-1985 (see table 1) using the “remaining fourteen states as controls” to evaluate the effect of
these reforms on female suicide rates. Figure 5 replicates their event-study result for female suicide
using an unweighted model with no covariates. 28 Our results match closely: suicide rates display
no clear trend before the implementation of unilateral divorce laws, but begin falling soon after.
They report a DD coefficient in logs of -9.7 (s.e. = 2.3). I find a DD coefficient in levels of -3.08
(s.e. = 1.13), or a proportional reduction of 6 percent. 29
A. Describing the design
Figure 6 uses the DD decomposition theorem to illustrate the sources of variation. I plot each 2x2
DD against its weight and calculate the average effect and total weight for the three types of 2x2
comparisons: treated/untreated, early/late, late/early. 30 As theorem 1 states, the two-way fixed
effects estimate, -3.08, is an average of the y-axis values weighted by their x-axis values. Summing
the weights on timing terms (𝑠𝑠𝑘𝑘ℓ ) shows exactly how much of 𝛽𝛽̂ 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 comes from timing variation

terms, but more on those

Data on suicides by age, sex, state, and year come from the National Center for Health Statistics’ Multiple Cause of
Death files from 1964-1996, and population denominators come from the 1960 Census (Haines and ICPSR 2010) and
the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data (SEER 2013). The outcome is the age-adjusted (using the
national female age distribution in 1964) suicide mortality rate per million women. The average suicide rate in my
data is 52 deaths per million women versus 54 in Stevenson and Wolfers (2006). My replication analysis uses levels
to match their figure, but the conclusions all follow from a log specification as well.
29
The differences in the magnitudes likely come from three sources: age-adjustment (the original paper does not
describe an age-adjusting procedure); data on population denominators; and my omission of Alaska and Hawaii.
30
There are 156 distinct DD components: 12 comparisons between timing groups and pre-reform states, 12
comparisons between timing groups and non-reform states, and (122 − 12)/2 = 66 comparisons between an earlier
switcher and a later non-switcher, and 66 comparisons between a later switcher and an earlier non-switcher

involving pre-1964 reform states (38.4 percent) than non-reform states (24 percent). Figure 6 also
highlights the role of a few influential 2x2 terms—comparisons between the 1973 states and nonreform or pre-1964 reform states account for 18 percent of the estimate, and the ten highest-weight
2x2 DD’s account for over half.
The bias resulting from time-varying effects is also apparent in figure 6. The average of
these post-treatment event-study estimates in figure 5 is -4.92, while the DD estimate is just 60
percent as large. The difference stems from the comparisons of later- to earlier-treated groups. The
average treated/untreated estimates are negative (-5.33 and -7.04) as are the comparisons of earlierto later-treated states (although less so: -0.19). 31 The comparisons of later- to earlier-treated states,
however, are positive on average (3.51) and account for the bias in the overall DD estimate. Using
the decomposition theorem to take these terms out of the weighted average yields an effect of 5.44—close to the average of the event-study coefficients. The DD decomposition theorem shows
that one way to summarize effects in the presence of time-varying heterogeneity is simply to
subtract the components of the DD estimate that are biased using the weights in equation (7).
B. Testing the design
Figures 7 and 8 test for covariate balance in the unilateral divorce analysis. Figure 6 plots the
reweighted balance test weights, 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝑇𝑇 − 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝐶𝐶 , from equation (17), the corresponding weights from a

timing-only design, and each group’s sample share. Larger groups have larger weight, but because

they have relatively low treatment variance, the earliest timing groups are downweighted relative
to their sample shares. 32 In fact, the 1969 states effectively act as controls because 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝑇𝑇 − 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝐶𝐶 < 0.

31

This point also applies to units that are already treated at the beginning of the panel, like the pre-1964 reform states
�𝑘𝑘 = 1 they can only act as an already-treated control group. If the
in the unilateral divorce analysis. Since their 𝐷𝐷
effects for pre-1964 reform states were constant they would not cause bias.
32
Adding 5 × 𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦 to the suicide rate for the 1970 states (𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝑇𝑇 − 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝐶𝐶 = 0.0039) changes the DD estimate from -3.08
to -2.75, but adding it to the 1973 group (𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝑇𝑇 − 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝐶𝐶 = 0.18) yields a very biased DD estimate of 12.28.

21

Figure 8 implements both a joint balance test and the reweighted test using two potential
determinants of marriage market equilibria in 1960: per-capita income and the male/female sex
ratio. Panel A shows that average per-capita income in untreated states ($13,431) is lower than the
average in every timing group except for those that implemented unilateral divorce in 1969 (which
actually get more weight as controls) or 1985. The joint 𝐹𝐹-test, however, fails to reject the null
hypothesis that these means are the same. It is not surprising that such a low power test (12

restrictions on 48 states observations) fails to generate strong evidence against the null. The
reweighed test, on the other hand, does detect a difference in per-capita income of $2,285 between
effective treatment states—those that implemented unilateral divorce in 1970 or later—and
effective control states—pre-1964 reform states, non-reform states, and the 1969 states. Panel B
shows that the 1960 sex ratio is higher in almost all treatment states than in the control states.
While the joint test cannot reject the null of equal means, the reweighted test does reject reweighted
balance (𝑝𝑝 = 0.06). 33

C. Evaluating alternative specifications
Researchers almost always estimate models other than (2) and use differences across specifications
to evaluate internal validity (Oster 2016) or choose projects in the first place. The DD
decomposition theorem suggests a simple way to understand why estimates change. Stacking the
� 𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐 . Any alternative
2x2 DD’s and weights from (7) into vectors, we can write 𝛽𝛽̂ 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 = 𝒔𝒔′ 𝜷𝜷

specification that equals a weighted average can be written similarly, and the difference between

33

One can run a joint test of balance across covariates using a seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR), as suggested
by Lee and Lemieux (2010) in the regression discontinuity context. The results of these 𝜒𝜒2 tests are displayed at the
top of figure 6. As with the separate balance tests, I fail to reject the null of equal means across groups and covariates.
The joint reweighted balance test, however, does reject the null of equal weighted means between effective treatment
and control groups. With 48 states and 12 timing groups, there are not sufficient degrees of freedom to implement a
full joint test across many covariates. This is an additional rationale for the reweighted test.

i.

Dropping Untreated Units

Papers commonly estimate models with and without untreated units, and the decomposition
theorem shows that this is equivalent to setting all 𝑠𝑠𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 = 0 and rescaling the 𝑠𝑠𝑘𝑘ℓ to sum to one.

Table 2 shows that this changes the unilateral divorce estimate so much that it becomes positive
(2.42, s.e. = 1.81), but figure 6 suggests that this occurs not necessarily because of a problem with
the design, but because half of the timing terms are biased by time-varying treatment effects.
ii.

Population Weighting

Solon, Haider, and Wooldridge (2015) show that differences between population-weighted (WLS)
and unweighted (OLS) estimates can arise in the presence of unmodeled heterogeneity, and
suggest comparing the two estimators (Deaton 1997, Wooldridge 2001). WLS increases the

Grosz, Miller, and Shenhav (2018) propose a similar decomposition for family fixed effects estimates.

23

influence of large units by weighting the means of 𝑦𝑦 that make up each 2x2 DD, and it increases

the influence of terms involving large groups by basing the decomposition weights on population
rather than sample shares.
Weighting in the unilateral divorce analysis changes the DD estimate from -3.08 to -0.35. Table
2 indicates that just over half of the difference comes from changes in the 2x2 DD terms, 38 percent
from changes in the weights, and 9 percent from the interaction of the two. Figure 9 scatters the
weighted 2x2 DD’s versus the unweighted ones. Most components do not change and lie along the
45-degree line, but large differences emerge for terms involving the 1970 states: Iowa and
California. 35 Weighting, which obviously gives more influence to California, makes the terms that
use 1970 states as treatments more negative, while it makes terms that use them as controls more
positive. This is consistent either with an ongoing downward trend in suicides in California or, as
discussed above, strongly time-varying treatment effects. 36
iii.

Triple-Difference Estimator

When some units should not be (as) affected by a given treatment, they can be used as a
falsification test. Assume that units belong to either an affected group (𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖 = 1) or an unaffected
group (𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖 = 0). The simplest way to incorporate the “third difference”, 𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖 , would be to estimate
� 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 and 𝛽𝛽
� 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 . One could equivalently estimate the
separate DD coefficients in each sub-sample: 𝛽𝛽
0
1
35

Lee and Solon (2011) observe that California drives the divergence between OLS and WLS estimate in analyses of
no-fault divorce on divorce rates (Wolfers 2006).
36
Weighting by (a function of) the estimated propensity score (Abadie 2005) is often used to impose covariate balance
between treated and untreated units (see Bailey and Goodman-Bacon 2015). The decomposition theorem points to
two limitations of this approach. First, reweighting untreated observations has no effect on the timing terms. Second,
reweighting untreated observations using the estimated probability of being in any treatment group does not impose
covariate balance within each pair. By changing the relative weight on different untreated units but leaving their total
2𝑥𝑥2
weight the same, this strategy does not change 𝒔𝒔, so all differences stem from the way reweighting affects the 𝛽𝛽̂𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘
terms. Table 2 estimates reweighted models based on a propensity score equation that contains the 1960 sex ratio and
per-capita income from figure 8, as well as the 1960 general fertility rate and infant mortality rate. This puts much
2𝑥𝑥2
much less negative, changing the
more weight on Delaware and less weight on New York, and makes almost all 𝛽𝛽̂𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘
overall DD estimate to 1.04. Callaway and Sant'Anna (2018) propose a generalized propensity score reweighted
estimator for DD models with timing variation.

DDD specifications that include a more saturated set of fixed effects overcome this

fixed effects (𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 ):

𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠 + 𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 + 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖 + 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

25

𝑔𝑔𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is the mean of 𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖 by 𝑠𝑠 and 𝑡𝑡. Unlike (19), estimates from (20) do net out changes across 𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖

within state/year cells. This changes the weights, though, because the introduction of variation
across the third difference within a cell leads to the typical OLS result that cells with more variation
get more weight. In this case, “more variation” in sample membership within a cell means
approximately equal numbers of units with 𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖 = 1 and 𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖 = 0. 38

Recasting this version of a DDD model as a DD on differences by 𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖 implies that the DD

decomposition theorem holds, albeit with a slight change to the calculation of the weights. All the
results and diagnostic tools derived above apply to specifications like (20) by defining the outcome
𝐺𝐺=1
𝐺𝐺=0
as 𝑦𝑦�𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠
− 𝑦𝑦�𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠
and using the proper weights.

iv.

Unit-specific linear time trends

Researchers control for unit-specific linear time trends to allow “treatment and control states to
follow different trends” (Angrist and Pischke 2009, p 238), and view it as “an important check on
the causal interpretation of any set of regression DD estimates” (Angrist and Pischke 2015, p. 199).
Appendix B derives a closed-form solution for the detrended estimator and shows that a version
of the DD decomposition theorem applies to it. The specific way that unit-specific trends change
each 2x2 component fit with previous intuition. They essentially subtract the cross-group
difference in averages of 𝑦𝑦 before and after the middle of the panel, 𝑡𝑡̅, but these differences are
weighted by absolute distance to 𝑡𝑡̅: |𝑡𝑡 − 𝑡𝑡̅|. This is, as Lee and Solon (2011) point out, akin to a

regression discontinuity design in that the estimator relies less on variation at the beginning or end
of the panel because this variation is absorbed by the trends. Unfortunately, trends tend to absorb
time-varying treatment effects that are necessarily larger at the end of the panel, and in these cases

𝐺𝐺=1
𝐺𝐺=0
Collapsing the data to the within-cell mean differences 𝑦𝑦�𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠
− 𝑦𝑦�𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠
and running OLS on the aggregated data (or
WLS using cell populations) would eliminate the 𝑔𝑔𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 (1 − 𝑔𝑔𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ) from the decomposition weights.

38

26

they over control. Unit-specific trends also increase the weight on units treated at the extremes of
the panel, changing estimates for this reason as well.
The unilateral divorce analysis provides a striking illustration of how unit-specific trends
can fail because figure 5 shows no pre-trends but strongly time-varying treatment effects. Trends
shrink the estimate so much that its sign changes (0.59, s.e.=1.35). Table 2 shows that changes in
2x2 DD’s account for 90 percent of the difference between estimates with and without trends, and
panel A of figure 10 shows that most of the treated/untreated components are much less negative
with trends, with especially large differences for the terms involving the 1970 states. Panel B of
2𝑥𝑥2
figure 10 shows that trends reduce the weight on 𝛽𝛽̂𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘
terms, and increase the importance of

timing-only comparisons. Since equation (11c) shows that the timing-only terms are already biased
by the time-varying treatment effects, the change in weighting induced by unit-specific trends

exacerbates this bias, accounting for 47 percent of the coefficient difference. Because unit-specific
trends change the treated/untreated terms and give them less weight, the interaction of those two
factors accounts for -36 percent of the overall change in the estimates.
v.

Group-specific linear pre-trends

A simple strategy to address counterfactual trends is to estimate pre-treatment trends in 𝑌𝑌𝑘𝑘0 directly

and partial them out of the full panel (cf. Bhuller et al. 2013, Goodman-Bacon 2018). This is what

we hope that unit-specific trends do, it does not depend on the treatment effect pattern, and it does
not change the weighting of the 2x2 DD’s. Specifically, using data from before 𝑡𝑡1∗ , one can estimate

a pre-trend in 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 for each timing group. 39 The slope will equal the linear component of
39

One could estimate pre-trends for each unit, but this yields identical point estimates to the group-specific pre-trends.
Moreover, group-specific trends reduce the variability of the estimator because trend deviations that would bias unit
specific pre-trends cancel out to some extent when averaged by timing group. This matters because this strategy
extrapolates potentially many periods into the future, magnifiying specification error in the pre-trends. This point
applies to unit-specific linear trend specifications as well. Point estimates are identical when this specification includes
linear trends for each group rather than each unit.

27

unobservables plus a linear approximation to trend deviations before before 𝑡𝑡1∗ . Removing this

trend from the full panel yields an outcome variable that is robust to linear trends, unaffected by
time-varying treatment effects, and weights each 2x2 DD component in the same way as the
unadjusted estimator. Like the unit-specific time trend control strategy, group-specific pre-trends
are sensitive to non-linear unobservables in the pre-period. Appendix C analyzes this estimator in
detail. Partialling out pre-trends yields a unilateral divorce effect of -6.52 (s.e. = 1.7); close to the
average post-treatment effect of -4.92. While inference is outside the scope of this paper (see Athey
and Imbens 2018), note that this two-step strategy necessarily involves a partly estimated outcome
variable so second-stage standard errors are incorrect.
vi.

Disaggregated time effects

If counterfactual outcomes evolve differently by a category, 𝑅𝑅, to which units belong, one can
model these changes flexibly by including separate time fixed effects for each category:
𝑅𝑅(𝑖𝑖)

𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡

𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷
+ 𝛽𝛽𝑅𝑅×𝑡𝑡
𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(21)

𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷
The coefficient 𝛽𝛽� 𝑅𝑅×𝑡𝑡 equals an average of two-way fixed effects estimates by values of 𝑅𝑅 weighted

�𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 . For simplicity, I refer to 𝑅𝑅
by the share of units in each 𝑅𝑅 (𝑛𝑛𝑅𝑅 ) and the within-𝑅𝑅 variance of 𝐷𝐷

as “region”, but the analysis is not specific to region-by-time fixed effects. When treatments vary
by county or city, for example, studies include state-by-time fixed effects (e.g. Almond, Hoynes,
and Schanzenbach 2011, Bailey and Goodman-Bacon 2015); when treatments vary by firm studies
include industry-by-year fixed effects (e.g. Kovak, Oldenski, and Sly 2018).
Since the decomposition theorem holds for each within-region DD estimate, it also holds

2x2 DD’s from large regions get more weight (via the 𝑛𝑛𝑅𝑅 ), but the distribution of timing groups

within region (the 𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑎𝑅𝑅 𝑛𝑛𝑏𝑏𝑅𝑅 terms) also determine the importance of each region. Regions with no

units in group 𝑘𝑘 contribute nothing to 2x2 DD’s involving that group, in contrast to the simpler
estimator where that region would contribute controls for group 𝑘𝑘. If no region contains units from

a given pair of groups that pair drops out of the disaggregated time effects specification. These
within-region 2x2 DD’s in (22) and (23) are weighted together using the cross-region average of
the sample share products, ∑𝑅𝑅 𝑛𝑛𝑅𝑅 𝑛𝑛𝑘𝑘𝑅𝑅 𝑛𝑛ℓ𝑅𝑅 as well as treatment variances.

Adding region-by-year effects to the unilateral divorce analysis cuts the estimated effect by a

factor of three (-1.16). Figure 11 plots the 2x2 DD’s and the weights from this specification against
those from the baseline model. 43 of the 156 2x2 terms in the baseline model drop out of the
within-region specification, and table 2 shows that about three quarters of the difference in the
estimates comes from the way these fixed effects change the weights.
IV.

CONCLUSION

Difference-in-differences is perhaps the most widely applicable quasi-experimental research
design. Its transparency makes it simple to describe, test, interpret, and teach. This paper extends
all of these advantages from canonical two-by-two DD models to general and much more common
DD models with variation in the timing of treatment.
My central result, the DD decomposition theorem, shows that a two-way fixed effects DD
coefficient equals a weighted average of all possible simple 2x2 DD’s that compare one group that
changes treatment status to another group that does not. Many ways in which the theoretical
29

interpretation of regression DD differs from the canonical model stem from the fact that these
simple components are weighted together based both on sample sizes and the variance of their
treatment dummy. This defines the DD estimand, the variance-weighted average treatment effect
on the treated (VWATT), and generalizes the identifying assumption on counterfactual outcomes
to variance-weighted common trends (VWCT). Moreover, I show that because already-treated
units act as controls in some 2x2 DD’s, the two-way fixed effects model requires an additional
identifying assumption of time-invariant treatment effects.
The DD decomposition theorem also leads to several new tools for practitioners. Graphing
the 2x2 DD’s against their weight displays all the identifying variation in any DD application, and
summing weights across types of comparisons quantifies “how much” of a given estimate comes
from different sources of variation. I use the DD decomposition theorem to propose a reweighted
balance test that reflects this identifying variation, is easy to implement, has higher power than
tests of joint balance across groups, and shows how large and in what direction any imbalance
occurs. I suggest several simple methods to learn why estimates differ across alternative
specifications. The weighted average representation leads to a Oaxaca-Blinder-Kitagawa-style
decomposition that quantifies how much of the difference in estimates comes from changes in the
2x2 DD’s, the weights, or both. Plots of the components or the weights across specifications show
clearly where differences come from and can help researchers understand why their estimates
changes and whether or not it is a problem.

Notes: The figure plots a stylized example of a timing-only DD set up with a treatment effect that is a trend-break
rather than a level shift (see Meer and West 2013). Following section II.A.ii, the trend-break effect equals 𝜙𝜙 ⋅ (𝑡𝑡 −
𝑡𝑡 ∗ + 1). The top of the figure notes which event-times lie in the 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(𝑘𝑘), 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(𝑘𝑘, ℓ), and 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(ℓ) periods for each
unit. The figure also notes the average difference between groups in each of these periods. In the 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(𝑘𝑘, ℓ) period,
outcomes differ by

𝜙𝜙
2

(𝑡𝑡∗ℓ − 𝑡𝑡∗𝑘𝑘 + 1) on average. In the 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(ℓ) period, however, outcomes had already been growing

in the early group for 𝑡𝑡∗ℓ − 𝑡𝑡∗𝑘𝑘 periods, and so they differ by 𝜙𝜙(𝑡𝑡ℓ∗ − 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘∗ + 1) on average. The 2x2 DD that compares
the later group to the earlier group is biased and, in the linear trend-break case, weakly negative despite a positive and
growing treatment effect.

treatment group and the non-reform states act as the control group. The x’s are the timing-only terms. The figure notes
the average DD estimate and total weight on each type of comparison. The two-way fixed effects estimate, -3.08,
equals the average of the y-axis values weighted by their x-axis value.

These are show in solid triangles and equal the difference between the total weight each treatment timing group
receives in terms where it is the treatment group (𝑤𝑤𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 ) and terms where it is the control group (𝑤𝑤𝐶𝐶𝑘𝑘 ): 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝑇𝑇 − 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝐶𝐶 . The
solid circles show the same weights but for versions of each estimator that exclude the untreated (or already-treated)
units and, therefore, are identified only by treatment timing. The open squares plot each group’s sample share.

Notes: The figure plots average per-capita income and male/female sex ratio in 1960 for each timing group in the
unilateral divorce analysis (combining the non-reform and pre-1964 reform states into the group labeled “Pre-64 +
NRS”). The horizontal lines equal the average of these variables using the weights from figure 6 (𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝑇𝑇 − 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘𝐶𝐶 ). Note
that the 1969 states get more weight as a control group, so they are part of the reweighted control mean. Each panel
reports the F-statistic and p-value from a joint test of equality across the means, and the reweighted difference,
standard error, and p-value from the re-weighted balance test. The top of the figure reports χ2 (𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑) test-statistics for
both covariates estimated using seemingly unrelated regressions.

Notes: Panel A plots the 2x2 DD components from two-way fixed effects estimates that use population weights (yaxis) and do not (x-axis). The size of each point is proportional to its weight in an OLS version of equation (7). WLS
estimates are much smaller than OLS estimates, and this figure shows that the source of this discrepancy is the 1970
no-fault divorce states, which include only Iowa and California. Weighting puts much more emphasis on California
and, therefore, every 2x2 DD component involving the 1970 states. Dropping California changes yields an OLS
estimate of -3.32 and a WLS estimate of -1.43.

Notes: Panel A plots the two-group DD’s from a model with unit-specific time trends (y-axis) against those from a
model without trends (x-axis). The size of each point is proportional to its weight in a model without trends. The trendadjusted estimate is small and positive compared to a negative DD estimate without them. Much of the change comes
from the effect of trends on each 2x2 estimate, especially for treated/untreated comparisons (closed triangles). Panel
B is the same except that it plots the weights. Treated/untreated terms that received the most weight in the unadjusted
model get relatively less in a trend-adjusted model. Timing terms that received more weight get relatively more in a
trend-adjusted model.

Notes: Panel A plots the two-group DD’s from a model with region-by-year fixed effects (y-axis) against those from
a model without them (x-axis). The size of each point is proportional to its weight in the sparser model with only year
fixed effects. 2x2 DD’s that drop out of the region-by-year FE model are shown in triangles and appear at “0” on the
y-axis, although they do not enter the decomposition as zeros. Panel B plots the decomposition weights from the two
models. Some 2x2 comparisons drop out in the model with region-by-year effects (when no region has states from
both timing groups) and the figures plot these components using triangles.

Notes: The table presents DD estimates from the alternative specifications discussed in section III. Column (1) is the
two-way fixed effects estimate from equation (2). Column (2) drops the pre-1964 reform and non-reform states.
Column (3) weights by state adult populations in 1964. Column (4) weights by the inverse propensity score estimated
from a probit model that contains the sex ratio, per-capita income, the general fertility rate, and the infant mortality
rate all measured in 1960. Column (5) includes state-specific linear time trends. Column (6) comes from a two-step
procedure that first estimates group-specific trends from 1964-1968, subtracts them from the suicide rate, and
estimates equation (2) on the transformed outcome variable. Column (7) includes region-by-year fixed effects. Below
the standard errors I show the difference between each estimate and the baseline result, an the last three rows show
the share of this difference that comes from changes in the 2x2 DD’s, the weights, or their interaction as shown in
equation (18).
