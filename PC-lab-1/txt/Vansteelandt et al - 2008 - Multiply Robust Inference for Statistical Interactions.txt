Multiply Robust Inference for Statistical Interactions
Stijn Vansteelandt, Tyler J. VanderWeele, Eric J. Tchetgen, and James M. Robins
A primary focus of an increasing number of scientific studies is to determine whether two exposures interact in the effect that they produce

on an outcome of interest. Interaction is commonly assessed by fitting regression models in which the linear predictor includes the product

between those exposures. When the main interest lies in the interaction, this approach is not entirely satisfactory, because it is prone to
(possibly severe) bias when the main exposure effects or the associations between outcome and extraneous factors are misspecified. In this
article we consider conditional mean models with identity or log link that postulate the statistical interaction in terms of a finite-dimensional

parameter but are otherwise unspecified. We show that estimation of the interaction parameter often is not feasible in this model, because it

requires nonparametric estimation of auxiliary conditional expectations given high-dimensional variables. We thus consider multiply robust

estimation under a union model that assumes that at least one of several working submodels holds. Our approach is novel in that it makes
use of information on the joint distribution of the exposures conditional on the extraneous factors in making inferences about the interaction

parameter of interest. In the special case of a randomized trial or a family-based genetic study in which the joint exposure distribution is
known by design or by Mendelian inheritance, the resulting multiply robust procedure leads to asymptotically distribution-free tests of the
null hypothesis of no interaction on an additive scale. We illustrate the methods through simulation and analysis of a randomized follow-up
study.

exposure A2. It thus encodes the absence of effect modification

A primary focus of an increasing number of scientific studies
is to determine whether two given exposures interact to pro
duce their effect, that is, whether the effect of one exposure is

(on scale g). More generally, one may fit a conditional mean
model of the form

modified by the second exposure. For instance, in many longi
tudinal studies, the question of whether the time evolution of
the response differs for subjects with different baseline char
acteristics/interventions is of primary interest. In genetic asso

ciation studies of complex disorders, the discovery of gene

+ q](X,Al;yl) + h(X;yQ)

environment and gene-gene interactions is of great interest,

because most complex disorders are thought to be caused by
numerous genes and environmental factors, a subset of which
may act synergistically. The development of robust and pow
erful tests of gene-gene interaction is of special interest to ge

neticists, because, when the effect of one locus is modified by
al?eles at another locus, the power to detect a phenotypic as
sociation with the first locus can be greatly reduced unless the
interaction is modeled explicitly (Cordell 2002).
When the outcome is continuous or positive-constrained and
uncensored, the presence of an effect modification between ex
posures A\ and A2 is commonly assessed by fitting a linear or
log-linear conditional mean model for the outcome Y, in which
the linear predictor includes the product between these expo
sures. To be specific, let X be a vector of measured pre-exposure
variables such that conditioning on X suffices to control for con
founding when estimating the effects of A \ and A2 on outcome
Y. Then the term ?* in the conditional mean model

E(Y\A,X) = g(y* + y?Al+yU2 + y*/X + ?*AlA2), (1)

with g defined as before, with q^(A,X; ?) a known function

smooth in ? and satisfying qi(A,X; ?) = 0 when A\A2 =
0, with q2(X, A2; y2), q\ (X, A\ ; yx), and h(X; y0) known
functions smooth in y = (y'0, y\, y'0)r (and Yq,Y\, and y2
variation-independent parameters) satisfying q\(X,0;y}) =

q2(X,0; y2) = 0, with ?* e Rp and y* e Rq unknown pa
rameters and with the joint law of (A, X) unrestricted. In
this model, the term ?73 (A, X; ?) encodes the statistical in
teraction between exposures A\ and A2 (possibly as a func
tion of X). Without loss of generality, we can require that

q^(A,X\?) satisfy q3(A,X;0) = 0 so that ?* = 0 contin

ues to encode the absence of statistical interaction. The func

tions q2(X, A2; y2) and q\ (X, A\\ y j) encode the main effects

(possibly as functions of X) of the exposures A2 and A\. Fi
nally, h(X; Yq) encodes the main effect of the extraneous fac

tors X. For instance, model (1) is the special case in which
q3(A, X; ?) = ?AxA2, q2(X, A2, y2) = Y2A2. q{ (X, Ax ; Yl) =
y\A\ and h(X; y0) = y0 + y^X.

the chosen scale g) as a function of exposures and extraneous

the observed data law otherwise unrestricted. In particular, the
proposed models leave the main effects of both exposures on
the outcome unspecified, along with their interactions with ex
traneous variables. We examine the properties of these mod

Because we cannot be certain that any of these four mod

guaranteed to be CAN when any one of them (but not neces

refer to such estimators as quadruply robust and, more gener

In fact, as mentioned earlier, a necessary condition for any es

timator to be CAN in model Ac\v H Ma, and thus in model
Aip H (Mv U Ma U Mya\ U Myai), is that an unbiased esti
mating equation for ?* (with nontrivial power against local al
ternatives) exists when /(A2IX) and f(Ax\X) are known. But
in Lemmas 1-3 in the supplemental materials (Vansteelandt et
al. 2008), we show that no such unbiased estimating equation
need exist when g is the exponential function and X has contin
uous components. The lack of an unbiased estimating equation
in this setting is connected with the following noncollapsibility
property of multiplicative interactions.

Remark. Noncollapsibility of multiplicative interactions.
Consider again model (4), and suppose that A and X are in

dependent. The model E(Y\A) = g(^AxA2 + rf[A\ + if2A2 +
yjq) is derived from model (4) by collapsing over X. Note that
this model is saturated when Ax and A2 are dichotomous. If
g(x) ? x, then ?* = k*, so additive interactions are collapsible

over X. But a trivial calculation shows that if g(x) = exp(jc),
then even /3* = 0 fails to imply that k* = 0.

Theorem 2. Suppose that the regularity conditions stated in
the supplemental material (Vansteelandt et al. 2008) hold and
that ?,yx,y2,ax, and cc2 are variation-independent. Then the
following results hold:

(a) When g(x) = x [g(x) = exp(x)], >(/?ciP " ?*) is RAL
cip (B^) with influence function
under model Bl?

ing functions G(i) and G(2) for y* under model My and H(d
and H(2) for a* under model Ma. Then -s/n{?(G(\), H(d) ?
j8(G(2),H(2))} = op(\) at the intersection submodel Ac\p H

MynMa.

Part (a) of Theorem 2 suggests that multiply robust estimators

of ?* in model Bl? (B??) can be obtained by solving an equa

tion of the form (8). The general results on doubly robust esti
mation of Robins and Rotnitzky (2001) further imply that any

regular CAN estimator of ?* in model B? (B??) has the same
asymptotic distribution as ?cip(d) for some d, and thus that any

multiply robust estimator in model Bl? (?^) can be obtained
in this way. Part (b) of Theorem 2 suggests that the choice of

estimators for a* and y * has no impact on the efficiency of ?cip
when the models My and Ma are specified correctly. Thus the
fact that y* and y% are estimated by G-estimators solving (10)
and (11), rather than by their more efficient maximum likeli
hood estimators (MLEs) under model Ac\v C\My, has no effect
on the asymptotic variance of ?cip when the law of the data lies
in ^lcip n My Pi Ma Nonetheless, the use of such G-estimators
is critical to control bias. Indeed, although the solution to (8) is a

CAN estimator under model ?4cip H (My U Ma) with g(x) = x

[under model Ac\v H My with g(x) = exp(jc)] when y* is re
placed by an arbitrary CAN estimator under model Ac\v C\My,

it is not CAN under the less restrictive model B? (or B^).

It follows, as a corollary of Theorem 4 in Section 4, that
when the residual outcome variance is constant in A [i.e.,
var{e(/T)|A,X} = o2(X) for some function a2(X)], the effi
cient estimating equation at ? in model .4cjp is obtained by re

placing d(A/, X/) in (8) with

It can be deduced from the results of Robins and Rotnitzky

Lemma (Tchetgen and Robins 2009). Let /*(A|X) =

(2001) that the semiparametric variance bounds in models Ac[p /*(Ai|X)/*(A2|X) be any fixed density for A|X with A\ and

and Bl? (?^) are identical whenever the model My H Ma A2 conditionally independent, given X, that is absolutely con
is true, and thus that solving (13) then yields a semiparametric

tinuous with respect to the true density /(A|X). Then the set of

functions D satisfying (5) is {d*(A, X, r); r = r(A, X) e Rp},

efficient estimator under model B1^ (B^) at me intersection where

model My H Ma. Note that (13) merely requires specifying
the conditional means of Ax and A2 given X, not the entire
conditional distribution. In practice, unless the variance func

tion g2(X) is further assumed to not depend on X, the unknown

- ?*{r(A, X)\A2, X} + E*{r(A, X)|X}], (17)

function g2(X) in (13) must be replaced by an estimator.
The homoscedasticity assumption that var{6(/?*)|A, X} does
not depend on A often may be implausible and is logically im
possible for count data with g(x) = exp(x). When this assump
tion fails, the efficient estimating equation at ?* in model .4cip
can be obtained following the methods developed in the next

section.

Remark. In the special case of binary Y with support {0, 1}
and g exponential, Tchetgen and Robins (2009) propose a dou
bly robust 'case-only' estimator ?TR for ?* that, unlike ?c
does not use the data on subjects with Y = 0 (the non-cases). In
the online supplement (Vansteelandt et al. 2008), we compare
the statistical properties of ?cip and ?TR.

4. CONDITIONALLY DEPENDENT EXPOSURES
In this section we relax the previous assumptions by allow
ing for the exposures Ax and A2 to be conditionally dependent

given X.

4.1 Estimation

and where the expectations ?*( ) are taken with respect to

r(Aix).

When Aj and A2 are dichotomous and we choose /*(A|X) =
1/4 with probability 1 and r(A, X) = 4dt(X,)[/{Ai = A2} -

/{Ai /A2}], weobtaind+(A,X,r)=dt(X/)A(A/,X/), thus

establishing (16) as a special case of (17). For nondichoto
mous Ai and A2, given any (user-supplied) density /*(A|X) =
/*(Ai|X)/*(A2|X) satisfying the conditions of the lemma,
we can apply (17) to an arbitrary (user-supplied) function,
say d(1)(A,X), to obtain a function d*(A/,X/,d(1)) that sat
isfies (5).
An alternative way to map an arbitrary function d(1)(A, X)
to an element of D is to apply the alternating conditional expec
tations (ACE) algorithm (Breiman and Friedman 1985; Bickel
et al. 1993). This is an iterative algorithm that, starting from
d(1)(A/, X/), computes the repeating conditional expectations

d(2,n)(A,,X,)

and

We first consider the special case of binary exposures. When
Ai and A2 are dichotomous, as when testing for gene-gene in
teraction between two possibly linked biallelic markers each

with dominant or recessive mode of inheritance, then an ar

bitrary function d(A/,X/) can be written as A^A/idn (X,-) +

Al2(l - AlX)d0X(Xi) + (1 - Ai2)AiXdX0(Xi) + (1 - Al2)d An )doo(X/) for given functions d?/(X;), k, I = 0, 1. It follows

that the set D of functions (A, X) satisfying (5) is the set
D = {dJ,"(X) A (A, X); dT(X) e Rp], where

AiA2 (1-Ai)(l-A2)
A(A,X) =-?-? +
E{AXA2\X] ?{(l-Ai)(l-A2)|X}
Ai(l-A2) (I-AOA2

= d(2m-1)(A,,X/)~?{d(2,77-1)(A;,X,)|An,X/} (18)

d(2m+1)(A,-,X/)

= d(2"7)(Az,X,)-?{d(2m)(A;,X/)|A/2,X/} (19)
for m ? 1,2,... until convergence at d(A/,X/,d(1^) =
lim^ocd^+^A^X,). The function d(Az, X,-, d(1)) then
satisfies (5). Although they are both in D, d(A/, X?, d(1)) and
d?(A/,X/, d(1)) will generally differ. The function d?(A,-,X/,

d(1)) exists in closed form and is easy to compute. In con
trast, the function d(A/, X;, d(l)) cannot be expressed in closed
form when A\ and A2 are both continuous, unlike when A\

and/or A2 is discrete (Bickel et al. 1993). Even so, in gen
eral, d(A,-,X/, d(1)) remains more difficult to compute than
dJr(A?, X?, d(1)). Furthermore, as we show later, a weighted
version of d(A/,X/,d^) is needed to obtain a locally semi

E{AX(1-A2)\X} E{(1-AX)A2\X]
parametric efficient estimator.

= {/(A|X)}-1[/{A1 = A2} - I{AX ? A2}]. (15)
Thus the estimating equations (6) with d e D can be written
equivalently as

0 = /=i
?d+(X/)A(Al-,X/) /(i8), (16)
where d7 is a member of the set of all p x 1 functions of X.

When the exposures An and A/2 are not both dichotomous

and dependent conditional on X/, we can use the following
characterization of the set D of functions (A, X) satisfying (5).

Unlike in the previous example, there do not exist compatible

models f(Ax \A2, X, ct\) and f(A2\Ax,X',a2) with variation
independent parameters when conditional dependence between
both exposures is allowed for. Therefore, inference for ?* can
not be made robust to misspecification of either one of these
conditional densities, and thus no consistent estimators can be

obtained under model A 0 (MyaX U Mya2).

Remark. More precisely, it can be shown that we can con
struct compatible models for /(Ai|A2,X) and /(A2|Ai,X)
with variation-independent parameters ocx and a2 if we as
sume that for chosen values aXQ and 020, the generalized odds

Chen (2007) and Tchetgen and Robins (2009), the common
parameter g can be estimated consistently if either the model

thus run the ACE algorithm) at a sufficient number M of
points (a?\ 1, a?2X),..., (anm, gum), spread across the support
of (A 1, A2). These points may be chosen for each given X? sep
arately by drawing a random sample from the joint distribution
of (A/i, A/2), given X/, and also should include the observed

To illustrate the methods, we reanalyze data from a placebo

U.K. to study blood pressure reduction, as described by Goet
ghebeur and Lapp (1997). The trial started with a run-in period
of 4 weeks in which all patients received placebo tablets, after
which they were randomized to 4 weeks of one of two active

ance and normal errors for the conditional distributions of

A\ given (A2,X) and A2 given (AX,X). The complexity of
these models warrants use of the bootstrap for inference; how

ever, no bootstrap-based variance estimates are reported, be
cause the numerical integration approach was extremely time
consuming. Table 1 shows that the obtained estimates (NI) are
more efficient than those obtained under the ad hoc strategy
when the conditional mean model for the outcome is specified
correctly but are biased and have greater imprecision otherwise.
This is due to numerical approximation error and the fact that
when the conditional mean model for the outcome is specified

incorrectly, the estimation procedure relies more heavily on re
striction (5), and thus on the numerical integration. Indeed, the

bias of the estimates diminished noticeably when we repeated

treatments (A or B) or placebo. Diastolic blood pressure mea
surements were obtained every 2 weeks. For illustration, we an
