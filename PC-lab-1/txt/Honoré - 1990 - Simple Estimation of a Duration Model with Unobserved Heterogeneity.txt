1. INTRODUCTION

DURATION MODELS with and without unobserved heterogeneity have been the
subject of much recent theoretical and empirical research. These models are often
specified by augmenting the proportional hazard model (Cox, 1972) with an
unobserved, random heterogeneity component. Standard maximum likelihood
procedures can be applied if distributional assumptions on the unobserved
heterogeneity are maintained. However, Heckman and Singer (1982, 1984b) have
demonstrated that the estimated parameters can be sensitive to the assumed
functional form for the heterogeneity. They therefore construct a nonparametric
maximum likelihood estimator which estimates the structural parameters as well
as the distribution of the unobserved component. Meyer (1986) generalizes this
idea to allow for nonparametric estimation of the duration dependence of the
model. The framework of Kiefer and Wolfowitz (1956) can be used to prove
consistency of these estimators, but no asymptotic distribution theory has yet
been established for these kinds of models.
This paper presents an alternative class of estimators of the "structural"
parameter in the simplest duration model with unobserved heterogeneity, the
Weibull model without regressors.The distribution of the unobserved heterogeneity is treated as a nuisance parameter and will not be estimated. The advantage of
the estimator is that it is possible to prove that it is asymptotically normal and to
consistently estimate its variance. Another advantage of the estimator is that it is
extremely easy to calculate. The conditions under which the estimator is valid
are, however, very restrictive. The estimator defined in the next section is derived

for the case of a Weibullmodel without regressors.While this model has been
applied by, for example,Heckmanand Walker(1987, 1988), and while the idea
behind the estimatorcan be used to constructestimatorsin some other special
cases (see Section 4), the estimatoris clearlynot an alternativein all the cases
wherethe nonparametricmaximumlikelihoodestimatorsof Heckmanand Singer
(1984b) and Meyer(1986)can be applied.It shouldalso be pointed out that the
validity of the estimatordependson the durationsbeing observedwithouterror.
The paperis organizedas follows:the estimatoris definedin Section2, and it
is proved that it is consistent and asymptoticallynormal when appropriately
normalized.The estimatoris defined as a function of certain order statistics,
where the orderdependson the samplesize in such a way that the relativeorder
(the percentile) goes to zero, while the absolute order goes to infinity. The
asymptoticdistributionof such orderstatisticshas been derivedin Reiss (1975).
The proof of asymptoticnormalitypresentedin Section2 amountsto firstwriting
the estimatoras a functiondependingon the truevalue of the parameterand on
order statisticsfrom a mixtureof exponentialsnot dependingon the parameter.
We then apply the theoremin Reiss (1975) to order statisticsof a mixtureof
exponentials, and the result is finally derived by applying the 8-method. In
Section 2 we will also derive a consistent estimator of the variance of the
asymptoticdistribution.Both the estimatorand the estimatorof the varianceare
very easy to calculate and requireno iterativescheme. Section 3 presents the
results of a Monte Carlostudy designedto determinewhetherthe small sample
distributionof the estimatorcan be preciselyapproximatedby the asymptotic
distributionderivedin Section2. We also evaluatethe extent to whichinference
made from the asymptoticdistribution,using the estimatedvariance,is useful in
sample sizes likely to appear in applications.Naturally, the results from the
Monte Carlo study can be interpretedas no more than a partialanswerto these
questions.To performthe Monte Carlostudy,it is necessaryto specify the true
value of the parameterof interest and the distributionof the unobserved
component. While we will completelycharacterizethe dependenceof the small
sample distributionof the estimatoron its truevalue,we makeno claim that the
resultsof the MonteCarlostudycan be uniformlyextendedto all distributionsof
the unobservedcomponent.
The Weibull model without regressorsis a very special case. It is therefore
interesting to investigatewhether the method of estimation proposed in this
paper can be used in other situations.In Section 4 it is demonstratedthat the
idea behind the estimatorcan be used to constructan estimatorfor a log-logistic
model with unobservedheterogeneity,and the possibilityof estimatingmodels
with regressorsis discussed.Section5 concludesthe paper.
2. DEFINITION OF THE ESTIMATOR

In the Weibull regression model, the hazard function2 is specified as
exp(Z13), whereZ is an exogenousvectorof regressors.This model is the

most frequently used in applications of duration models. In this section, we will
construct an estimator of a when there are no regressors and the hazard is
augmented by a nonnegative, multiplicative random constant, O.3 The survivor
function is then given by

(1)

S(t) = P(T> t)

e0a dG(6)

where G is the distribution function for 0. Notice that we use 0 to denote the
random variable as well as the dummy used in the integration. It follows by
repeated use of l'Hospital's rule that if the mixing distribution has a finite mean,
then
(2)

This proves that a is identified if we maintain the assumption that the mean of
the mixing distribution is finite.4 Jewell (1982) has shown that a is not identified
without that assumption.
The idea behind the estimator is to find a sample analog to the right-hand side
of (2).5 One such sample analog can be constructed by letting t be the mth order
statistic of the sample, where m -x oo but (m/n) -- 0. As S(t) we can then use
1 - (m/n). In this paper, we limit ourselves to choosing m = n1-d for some d
between zero and one.6 This restriction is imposed because it makes it much
easier to verify the conditions necessary to derive an asymptotic theory.

DURATIONMODEL

It is interesting to compare the asymptotic distribution in (4) to the asymptotic
distribution of order statistics of fixed relative rank (m/n fixed). If {Xi} is an
independent sequence of random variables from a distribution F with density f,
then the asymptotic distribution of the mth order statistic is given by
n-( Xm: n-

which can be written as
(1 -F( I ))) -1/2f ( IL)( Xm: n- I) +N(O, 1) ,
where fL is defined by F(ti) = m/n and m/n is fixed. If we substitute m = n1 -d
into the distribution above, then we get exactly (4). This, of course, is not a
correct derivation of (4), but it shows that Lemma 1 gives the "expected" results.

From this it follows that a(d) is consistent, but that the rate of convergence is
log (n), where the slow rate of convergence is due to a large bias rather than a
large variance. We would like to be able to present the asymptotic distribution in
the form H(n )(a - a) -: N(O,1) for some function H(n) in order to perform the
usual asymptotic tests, so a further examination of the bias of a(d) 1 is called
for.

From this it follows that if s1 is definedby

then sl/s -> 1. This implies that sj 1(Y - y) has the same asymptotic distribution
as s 1(Y-y).
and
sj1 is of order log(n)n(1d1)/2, so s1 l(y_ 1) is of order n(1-d1)/2-d2
therefore s1(y1) -k 0 as long as d1 + 2d2 > 1. Hence s 1(Y- y) has the same
asymptotic distribution as s1 1(Y- 1), and so

Replacing a in the normalizingtermby a(d1, d2) will not affect the asymptotic
distribution(becausea&(dl,d2) is a consistentestimatorfor a). Thus we have not
only an estimatorof a, but also an estimatorof its standarddeviation.
The rate of convergence of the estimator is log(n)n(1 -d)/2. Since d1 > 1/3

(because 0 < d2 < d1< 1 and d1+ 2d2 > 1), it follows that the rate of convergence of a(d1, d2) can be made arbitrarilyclose to nl/3. Unfortunately,to make
d1 close to 1/3, d2 must be made close to d1, whichmakes the denominatorof
the variance close to zero. This suggests that other values of (d1, d2) might
performbetterin finitesamples.We will returnto this subjectin the next section.
It should be noted that the estimatordependsonly on the observationsin a
neighborhoodof zero. The estimatoris thereforealso valid under censoringas

is also interestingto note that the varianceof the estimatoris given by a22,

seen from the fact that &(d1,d2) = aY, and hence log(&(d1, d2)) = log(a) +
log(Y), where the distributionof Y does not dependon a.
Finally, notice that in Theorem1 it is not necessaryto assumethat 0 is in a
class of uniformlyintegrablerandomvariables.This is neededin Heckmanand
Singer (1984b), because they need identificationof the completionof the set of
heterogeneitydistributions.The approachtakenhere avoids this becausethereis
a closed form expressionfor the estimator.
3. MONTE CARLO EVIDENCE

The possibilitythat the asymptoticdistributionof the orderstatisticis a poor
approximationto the finitesampledistribution,combinedwith the highlynonlinear functionused in the definitionof the estimator,a(d1, d2), makesit of interest
to performa Monte Carlostudy of the small samplepropertiesof the estimator.
A relatively large-scaleMonte Carlo study is made possible by the simple
expressionsfor the parameterand varianceestimators.
It was noted in Section2 that a(d1, d2) is invariantto changesin the scale of
the data. We will thereforenot considerthe effect on the estimatorof changing
the scale of the heterogeneitydistribution.We will also not considerthe effectof

changingthe true value of a. From Theorem1 it is known that a(dj, d2) = aY,
where Y does not dependon a, so the small samplecharacteristicsof a(d1, d2)
do not depend on a.
This Monte Carlo study will: (i) investigatewhetherthe asymptoticdistribution of a(d1, d2) derivedin Theorem1 is a good approximationto the small
sample distributionof ai(dj,d2); (ii) decide to what extent the asymptotictests
and confidenceintervalssuggestedby the estimatorsof the varianceof ac(d1,d2)
can be reliedupon to make"correct"smallsampleinference;(iii) investigatehow
the answers to (i) and (ii) depend on the sample size and the underlyingtrue
mixing distribution;and (iv) determinegood valuesof d1 and d2.
Becauseof its simplicity,the uniformdistribution(from0 to 2) is used for the
heterogeneityin the first experiment.The discussion surroundingTheorem 1
showed that the bias of a(dj, d2) can be expectedto be positivelyrelatedto the
coefficient of variation.For a positive uniform distribution,the coefficientof
variationis largestwhen the left end point is zero.8So in termsof the bias, the
chosen heterogeneitydistributionis the least favorable among the uniform
distributions.To answerquestion(iii) above,we will also considerheterogeneity
distributionsthat are discrete,lognormal,and Pareto.
All specificationswill be evaluatedwith 200, 1000, and 5000 observations,each
replicated5000 times.9
In Figure 1, the densityof the estimatoris plotted for samplesizes 200, 1000,
and 5000, when the true value of a is 1 and the heterogeneitydistribution is U[0,2]. The densities are estimatedusing a kernel estimatorwith the
Epanechnikovkernel(see Silverman(1986,p. 42)) and bandwidthgivenby (3.31)
in Silverman (1986). The figure also shows the densities predicted by the
asymptotic distribution,calculatingy and s2 from the true values of ILit"and
p(,in).10 The graphs in Figure 1 indicate that the distributionof &(dj,d2) is
slightly skewed, reflectingthe highly nonlinearfunctionsinvolvedin the definition of the estimator.Exceptfor the slight skewness,the figureindicatesthat the
distributionfor a(d1, d2) can be approximatedreasonablywell by the asymptotic
distribution.This, of course,is importantmainlyfor testing,so to be able to give
a more complete assessmentof the usefulnessof the asymptoticdistribution,we
must investigatethe propertiesof testsbasedon the asymptoticdistribution.This
is done below, but first the sensitivity of the estimator to various mixing
distributionsis investigated.
It is clear from the resultsin Section2 that the behaviorof a(dj, d2) shouldbe
sensitive to the coefficientof variation.To investigatethe sensitivityof Ca(dl,d2)
to different mixing distributions,we thereforeconsider two cases. First we

DURATION MODEL

consider different mixing distributions with the same coefficient of variation, and
then we consider distributions with different coefficients of variation.
The uniform distribution considered above has coefficient of variation equal to
1/ V3 (the largest possible coefficient of variation for a uniform distribution with
positive support). In addition to the uniform distribution, we will also generate
data using a lognormal distribution, a Pareto distribution, and a two-point
discrete distribution. The discrete distribution has mass point at zero, implying
that some of the individuals (stayers) have infinite waiting times.
The results in Section 2 were based on second order Taylor expansions of the
Laplace transform of the mixing distribution around zero, which gave the
restriction that the second moment of the mixing distribution is finite. It was not
required that the Laplace transform have third derivatives at zero, and it was
therefore not necessary to assume that the mixing distribution has a finite third
moment. However, one would expect the third moment to be important for the
small sample distribution of a(dj, d2) because the third moment determines how
closely the second order Taylor series expansion approximates the Laplace
transform. Three of the mixing distributions considered have a finite third
moment. The uniform distribution has a third moment of 2, the discrete distribution 1.778, and it is 2.370 for the lognormal distribution. The Pareto distribution
does not have a finite third moment.
The first four columns of Table I present the results of the Monte Carlo
experiment with the different mixing distributions all having v2 = 1/3. The

averages of the estimates are in all cases very close to the true value of a, and s1
is very close to the standard error.
The results in the first four columns of Table I indicate that the properties of
ca(dl, d2) do not change drastically when the mixing distribution changes, as long
as the coefficient of variation is the same. We therefore concentrate on only one
heterogeneity distribution in order to investigate the dependence of the a(dl, d2)
on the coefficient of variation. The discrete distribution with two points of
support is chosen because it is simple to generate observations from a discrete
distribution.
The last four columns of Table I give the results of changing the coefficient of
variation of the mixing distribution. We see that the basis of the estimator
increases when the coefficient of variation increases. It follows from the expression for y following Theorem 1 in the previous section that this is exactly the
expected result. In Table I, we also present the values of y for each of the
and it
experiments (y is calculated as 1 + v2(n-di - n-d2)(2(d1 - d2)log(n))-f),
is seen that y is close to the mean of the estimator, especially for large samples.
To determine the importance of the biases found for mixing distributions with
large coefficients of variation, it is necessary to have an idea about which values
of v2 are likely to be relevant in applications. Heckman and Walker (1987, 1988)
model the duration from marriage to conception for a sample of Hutterite
women. In Heckman and Walker (1988, Table 4), they present an estimate of the
mixing distribution in a mixture of Weibulls. The estimated mixing distribution
has v = 0.188. The small value v estimated by Heckman and Walker (1988) does
not imply that the heterogeneity is unimportant in their data set. The point
estimate of a changes from 0.540 to 1.073 when the heterogeneity is included.
Using information about later conceptions, Heckman and Walker (1987, Table
A4) estimate a heterogeneity distribution in a mixture of Weibulls with v = 0.307.
To summarize the results concerning the dependence of the small sample
behavior of the estimator on the true mixing distribution, we conclude that for a
given value of the coefficient of variation, the performance of &(dl, d2) seems to
be almost independent of the mixing distribution (including the possibility of a
point mass at zero). The bias increases with the coefficient of variation as
predicted in Section 2.
Table I showed that a(dl, d2) is a good point estimate for a. We now turn to
the issue of using the estimator for testing a = a0, for some a0. Since the variance
of a(dl, d2) is a2s2, we consider two tests, namely tests based on aos12and tests
based on ca(dl, d2)2sI, the latter having the interpretation of whether or not a
confidence interval around a(dl, d2) covers a0. Table II presents the results of
testing a = ao for a0 = 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.4 for the specifications in Table I
for which v2 = 1/3. The numbers in Table II tell how often each of the
alternatives was rejected at a (asymptotic) five-percent level.
We finally address the question of how to choose good values of d1 and d2.
Table I showed that a(dl, d2) is potentially biased when the coefficient of
variation is large, but that the bias can be approximated by a known function of
the coefficient of variation. Table III presents the values of d, and d2 which

minimize the mean square error as calculated from the expressions for s2 and y
presented in Section 2 for various values of v2. The implied root mean square
error is also presented. In the Taylor series expansions in the previous section, we
have in general kept terms of order n d1 and n-d2 and ignored terms of order
n- 2d and n -2d2.
It is thereforeunsatisfactorythat the "optimal"values of di
and d2 have di > 2d2, because this means that some of the ignored terms are of
higher order than some of the terms not ignored. The last three columns of Table
III present the results of the calculations that led to the first columns, except that
we have imposed the additional condition that di < 2d2.
It is important to note that the results presented in Table III are only
suggestive, as they are based on approximations. In order to make them formally
correct, we would have to (uniformly) bound the approximation error.

4. EXTENSIONS

The estimation strategy used to construct the estimator in Section 2 depends
critically on (2), which in turn is a consequence of the Weibull specification. It
would therefore be interesting to know whether the method can be used to
construct estimators in models where the Weibull assumption in Section 2 is
replaced by some other parametric assumption. We have not been able to fully

characterize the set of hazard functions for which this is the case," but the
following example shows that the Weibull hazard is not the only element.
Consider, for example, the log-logistic distribution used by Trussell and
Richards (1985) and David and Mroz (1986). With unobserved heterogeneity and
no covariates, the integrated hazard is 0 log ((Xt)a + 1), so the model can be
written as

P(T> t)

l

(Xt) + 1

dG(O).

11 The analysis in Honore (1987) indicated that the methodology can be used when the parameters
of interest can be determined by the behavior of the survivor function in a neighborhood of zero.

DURATION MODEL

Heckman and Singer (1984a) need to assume that the mean of the mixing
distribution is finite and known in order to identify X and G. To avoid this
problem, we consider a the parameter of interest and ignore the fact that X
might not be identified.
Define X = log ((XT)a + 1). Then P(X > x) = Jfo exp (-x)
dG(O), and
= alog(X) +
) + 1), which implies that log(exp(X)-1)
Xm: n =log((XTmn
a log (T) and hence
log (Tml
.1)
=

-log (Tm2.n)

a1 (log (exp (xml: n) -1)

log (exp ( Xm. n)

1)).

This is exactly the same situation as in the Weibull case: we can define an
estimator which is equal to aY, where Y is a known function of order statistics
from a mixture of exponentials. The only difference is that the form of Y is
somewhat different.
Regressors are usually important in economic applications of duration models.
It is therefore interesting to investigate whether the estimator presented in
Section 2 can be modified to the Weibull distribution with regressors. In that
case, the survivor function is written as

P(T> tIZ) =

j

exp(-OeZfita) dG(O).

In that case, it is known that a -I1/ can be estimated by either maximum
likelihood ignoring the heterogeneity (Lancaster (1985)) or by regressing log(T)
on Z (Flinn and Heckman (1982) and Heckman and Borjas (1980)). By ignoring
the regressors, a can be estimated using the methods presented in Section 2, and
by multiplying the estimator for a -l1/ by an estimator for a, we have an
estimator for ,B. This method of estimating ,B will not be valid if there is
censoring.
It is also possible to construct an estimator of f8 using the strategy from
Section 2. This is most easily seen in the simple case, where there is one
categorical regressor taking the values 0 and 1. The sample can then be divided
into two subsamples, one in which the mean of the heterogeneity distribution is
E[O], and one in which it is e-E[O]. This means that in this case, the problem of
estimating f8has been reduced to a problem of estimating the mean of the mixing
distribution in (1). Using the same logic as in the proof of Theorem 1, it can be
shown that

Hence the mean of the mixingdistributionfor each of the two subsamplescan
be estimatedby a linearcombinationof orderstatisticsfor each sample.
If the regressoris not categorical,then the mean of the heterogeneityin
the subsample defined by {ZiEA} is E[O]E[eZPIZEA] for any subset A.
E[ez#IZ E Aj]/E[ezflIZ EA2] can thereforebe estimatedfor any two subsetsA1
and A2 of the supportof Z. For any given value of b, E(eZbIZEAj]/E[eZbIZ
e A2] can also be estimatedby the ratio of the correspondingempiricalmoments. The value of b that minimizesthe distance between the estimatorsof
E[eZP1ZE AI]/E[ezlZEIE A2J and E[eZblZE AI]/E[eZblZ E Aj can then be
used to estimate12/. This approachgeneralizesto the case where there is more
than one regressor.As in Section2, the asymptoticpropertiesof this estimator
will not depend on whetheror not thereis censoringas long as all the censoring
times are bounded away fromzero.
5. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have proposeda class of estimatorsof the structuralparameter of a simple durationmodelwith unobservedheterogeneity.
The main advantageof the estimator over existing proceduresis that the
estimator is asymptoticallynormal, and that the asymptoticvariance can be
consistentlyestimated.We can thereforeuse the asymptoticdistributionto test
hypothesesabout the parameter.Anotheradvantageof the estimatoris that it is
very easy to calculate,as is a consistentestimatorof the standarddeviationof the
estimator.
The main disadvantageof the estimatoris that it is likelyto be verysensitiveto
measurementerrorsotherthan a simplemultiplicativemeasurementerror,which
is mathematicallyequivalentto the kind of unobservedheterogeneityconsidered
in this paper.Anotherdisadvantageis that the model underwhich the estimator
is valid is very restrictive.
A Monte Carlo study shows that the asymptotic distributionis a good
approximationto the small sample distributionof the estimatoras long as the
coefficientof variationof the mixingdistributionis not too large.

Then K( ) is continuously increasing and at least twice differentiable with K(O) = 0, K'(0) = E[f],
and K"(0) = - E[92]. Therefore K- 1(-) exists and is at least twice differentiable with K- 1(O)= 0,
Using Young's form of Taylor's theorem, we
(K-1)'(0) = 1/E[O], and (K-1)"(0) = E[02]/E[f]3.
