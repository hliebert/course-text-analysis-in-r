We show how a discrete instrument can be used to identify the marginal
treatment effects under a functional structure that allows for treatment
heterogeneity among individuals with the same observed characteristics and self-selection based on the unobserved gain from treatment.
Guided by this identification result, we perform a marginal treatment
effect analysis of the interaction between the quantity and quality of children. Our estimates reveal that the family size effects vary in magnitude
and even sign and that families act as if they possess some knowledge
of the idiosyncratic effects in the fertility decision.

I. Introduction
Many empirical papers use instrumental variables (IV) estimators to estimate a model of the following type:

where Y is the dependent variable, X is a vector of covariates, D is the binary regressor of interest, and e is the error term. The standard problem
of selection bias (D correlated with e conditional on X ) is solved with a
valid instrumental variable Z. Influential work by Imbens and Angrist
(1994) has clarified the interpretation of IV estimates as local average
treatment effects (LATE) when b is a random coefficient. With selection
on the unobserved gain from treatment (b correlated with D), the LATE
is informative only about the average causal effect of an instrumentinduced shift in D. In general, agents induced to treatment by Z need
not be the same agents induced to treatment by a given policy change,
and the average b of the two groups can differ substantially. This raises
concerns about the external validity and policy relevance of the LATE,
unless the instrument-induced effect of treatment is the parameter of
interest.
To move beyond the LATE, Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2005, 2007)
generalize the marginal treatment effect (MTE) introduced by Björklund
and Moffitt (1987). The MTE has several useful features: it plays the role
of a functional that is invariant to the choice of instrument; it has an attractive economic interpretation as a willingness to pay parameter for
persons at a margin of indifference between participating in an activity
or not; and all conventional treatment parameters can be expressed as
different weighted averages of the MTEs, such as the average treatment
effect (ATE) and the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). Using the method of local instrumental variables (LIV), the MTE can be
identified and estimated under the standard IV assumptions of conditional independence and monotonicity (see Vytlacil 2002; Heckman
2010).
While the MTE has several useful features, full nonparametric identification is challenging because it requires instruments that generate continuous support on the probability of treatment P(Z ) from zero to one for
each value of X. In practice, instruments are often discrete, and many are
binary. In such situations, there are two alternative approaches to move
beyond the LATE. One alternative is to abandon the goal of point identification and instead construct bounds on conventional treatment parameters. Unfortunately, bounds that do not involve additional assumptions tend to be very wide and therefore rarely informative.1 Another
alternative is to adopt some form of parametric or functional structure.
For example, one could assume that treatment effects are the same for
1
As discussed in detail later, Manski’s (1989) no-assumption bounds on the ATE and the
ATT are too wide to be informative in our context. Indeed, the bounds remain nearly uninformative even if we impose the IV assumptions.

everyone with the same observed characteristics or that treatment effects
vary but individuals do not sort on the unobserved gain from treatment
(see, e.g., Angrist and Fernandez-Val 2013). However, the constant effect
assumption has been tested and rejected in a wide range of settings, and a
number of studies find that individuals self-select on the basis of unobserved gain from treatment (see, e.g., Carneiro, Heckman, and Vytlacil
2011; Kirkebøen, Leuven, and Mogstad 2016).
In this paper, we show how a discrete instrument can be used to identify
the MTE under functional structure that allows for treatment heterogeneity among individuals with the same observed characteristics and selfselection based on the unobserved gain from treatment. We begin by
showing that an MTE model with at most N parameters can be identified
under the standard IV assumptions when P(Z ) takes N different values for
each value of X. One key implication is that a linear MTE model can be
identified even with a single binary instrument. Although restrictive,
the estimator based on the linear MTE model nests the standard IV estimator: The model gives the exact same estimate of LATE, while at the
same time providing a simple test for its external validity and a linear approximation of a more general MTE model.2
In some applications with discrete instruments, however, one may be
reluctant to impose strong parametric restrictions (e.g., linearity) on the
MTE model. In such cases, an auxiliary assumption is required. We show
that with a binary instrument and M different values of the covariates X,
an MTE model with no more than M 1 1 parameters can be identified under the standard IV assumptions and the auxiliary assumption of additive
separability between observed and unobserved heterogeneity in treatment effects. Although restrictive, this auxiliary assumption is implied by
additive separability between D and X, as imposed in equation (1), which
is standard in applied work using IV.
Our identification results are based on an alternative estimation approach to the conventional LIV method. In the LIV approach, the MTE
is identified by differentiating EðY jX 5 x; P ðZ Þ 5 pÞ with respect to p,
which can be computed over the empirical support of P(Z ) conditional
on X. With a binary instrument, P(Z) takes only two values for each value
of X, and LIV cannot identify even a linear MTE model. The alternative
approach, however, identifies the MTE from separately estimating EðY jX 5
x; P ðZ Þ 5 p, D 5 1Þ and EðY jX 5 x; P ðZ Þ 5 p, D 5 0Þ. With a binary
instrument, the advantage of the alternative estimation approach is that
2
Note that our test requires only a single binary instrument. In contrast, the approaches
to test the external validity of LATE proposed by Heckman and Schmierer (2010),
Heckman, Schmierer, and Urzua (2010), and Angrist and Fernandez-Val (2013) require
either two (or more) instruments or one instrument that takes on multiple values. Our test
is therefore a particularly useful complement in applications with a single binary instrument.

we have, for each value of X, two values of P(Z ) for the treated (alwaystakers vs. always-takers and compliers) and two values of P(Z ) for the untreated (never-takers vs. never-takers and compliers).3 The additional
information allows us to use a binary instrument to (i) estimate a linear
(approximation of the) MTE model under the standard IV assumptions,
(ii) test the external validity of LATE, and (iii) estimate a flexible MTE
model under the additional assumption of additive separability between
observed and unobserved heterogeneity in treatment effects.4
Guided by these identification results, we empirically assess the interaction between the quantity and quality of children. Motivated by the seminal quantity-quality (QQ) model of fertility by Becker and Lewis (1973),
a large and growing body of empirical research has examined the effects
of family size on child outcomes. Much of the early literature that tested
the QQ model found that larger families reduced observable measures of
child quality, such as educational attainment (e.g., Rosenzweig and Wolpin 1980; Hanushek 1992). However, recent studies from several developed countries have used binary instruments, such as twin births and
same-sex sibship, to address the problem of selection bias in family size.
The estimated LATEs suggest that family size has little effect on children’s
outcomes.5
Although these studies represent a significant step forward, a concern
is that the effects of family size may be both more varied and more extensive than what the IV estimates suggest. To move beyond the LATE of
family size, we apply the separate estimation approach to Norwegian administrative data. We begin by using the same-sex instrument to estimate a
linear MTE model. Our test suggests that the external validity of the LATE
of family size can be rejected at conventional significance levels. We next
impose the auxiliary assumption of additive separability between observed
3
In the terminology of Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin (1996), the treated consist of compliers whose behavior is affected by the binary instrument at hand and always-takers who
are treated irrespective of whether the instrument is switched off or on; the untreated
are likewise composed of compliers and never-takers, where the latter group avoids treatment even when the instrument is switched on.
4
See Heckman and Vytlacil (2007) and Carneiro and Lee (2009) for a discussion of the
alternative estimation approach in situations with an instrument that generates continuous
support on the probability of treatment P(Z) from zero to one for each value of X. With
such instruments, Heckman and Vytlacil (2007) show that the alternative estimation approach can nonparametrically identify MTE over the full unit interval, while Carneiro
and Lee (2009) use the approach to estimate the distribution of potential outcomes. None
of these studies consider situations with discrete instruments.

Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2005) conclude that “there is little if any family size effect on child education” (697). Using data from the United States and Israel, CaceresDelpiano (2006) and Angrist, Lavy, and Schlosser (2010) come to a similar conclusion.
However, Mogstad and Wiswall (2016) reexamine the analysis by Black et al. (2005) and
find a significant but nonlinear relationship between family size and child outcomes: While
a second sibling increases the educational attainment of firstborn children, additional children have a negative effect.

and unobserved heterogeneity in treatment effects and estimate a flexible specification of the MTE model. We then find that the effects of family size vary in magnitude and even sign (i.e., b is heterogeneous) and that
families act as if they possess some knowledge of their idiosyncratic return
in the fertility decision (i.e., b is correlated with D). We show that these results are robust to a number of specification checks, and we use the twins
instrument to validate the MTE estimates based on the same-sex instrument. Finally, we compare the MTE weights associated with the IV estimates to the MTE weights associated with the ATE and the ATT, and we
find that the latter treatment parameters assign much more weight to the
positive part of the MTE distribution. This explains why the ATE and the
ATT of family size are sizable and positive, while the LATEs based on twin
births or same-sex sibship are smaller and sometimes negative.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents
the generalized Roy model and uses it to define MTE. This section also
reviews how LIV and the separate estimation approach identify and estimate MTEs with a continuous instrument. Section III shows how to identify and estimate MTEs with discrete instruments. Sections IV and V present our empirical analysis of the effects of family size on child outcomes.
Section VI presents conclusions.
II. Framework and Estimation Procedures
A.

The Generalized Roy Model

The generalized Roy model is a basic choice-theoretic framework for empirical analysis. Let Y1 be the potential outcome of an individual in the
treated state (D 5 1) and Y0 denote his potential outcome in the untreated
state (D 5 0).6 The observed outcome (Y ) can be linked to the potential
outcomes through the switching regression model:
Y 5 ð1 2 D ÞY0 1 DY 1 :
We specify the potential outcomes as
Yj 5 mj ðX Þ 1 Uj ,

j 5 0, 1,

(2)

where m1() and m0() are unspecified functions, X is a random vector of
covariates, while U1 and U0 are random variables for which we normalize
EðU1 jX 5 xÞ 5 EðU0 jX 5 xÞ 5 0 and assume that EðUj2 jX 5 xÞ exists
for j 5 0, 1, for all x in the support of X. We do not assume that X and
(U0, U1) are independent.
6
For simplicity, we consider only a binary treatment variable. See Heckman, Urzua, and
Vytlacil (2006), Heckman and Vytlacil (2007), Heckman and Urzua (2010), and Kirkebøen
et al. (2016) for discussions of IV and MTE estimation with multiple treatment variables.

The individual’s net benefit of receiving treatment (ID) depends on observed variables (Z) and an unobserved component (UD):
ID 5 mD ðΖ Þ 2 UD ,

(3)

where mD() is an unspecified function, UD is a continuous random variable with a strictly increasing distribution function, and Z 5 ðX , Z2 Þ is
a vector in which Z2 represents the excluded instrument(s), that is, a variable that enters the selection equation (3) but is excluded from the potential outcome equations (2). An individual selects the treated state if
the net benefit of treatment is positive: D 5 1fID > 0g. The marginal distribution of UD can be normalized to a uniform distribution on the unit interval. The function mD(Z) is then interpretable as a propensity score: We
therefore write P ðZ Þ ; PrðD 5 1jZ Þ 5 mD ðZ Þ so that D 5 1 if P ðZ Þ > UD .
The generalized Roy model allows ID to depend on Y0 and Y1, which
leads to dependence between (U1, U0) and UD. The key assumption about
the random variables is as follows.
Assumption 1. (U0, U1, UD) is independent of Z, conditional on X.
The traditional approach to estimating the model of equations (2) and
(3) specifies a parametric joint distribution of the random variables (U0,
U1, UD) (see, e.g., Björklund and Moffitt 1987). By contrast, we will not
make assumptions about the joint distribution of these variables. With
Z stochastically independent of (U0, U1, UD) given X, the model of equations (2) and (3) implies and is implied by the standard IV assumptions
of conditional independence and monotonicity (see Vytlacil 2002;
Heckman 2010).
To define the MTE, we use the following notation for the conditional
expectations of U1 and U0:
kj ðp, x Þ 5 EðUj jX 5 x, UD 5 pÞ,

j 5 0, 1,

and
k ðp, x Þ 5 k1 ðp, x Þ 2 k0 ðp, x Þ 5 E ðU1 2 U0 jX 5 x, UD 5 p Þ:

(4)

The MTE can then be expressed as follows.
Deﬁnition 1. The MTE is the expected treatment effect conditional
on UD and X:
MTEðx, p Þ 5 E ðY1  Y0 jX 5 x, UD 5 p Þ 5 m1 ðx Þ  m0 ðx Þ 1 k ðp, x Þ:
Note that conditioning on UD 5 p is equivalent to conditioning on the
intersection of P ðZ Þ 5 p and ID 5 0. As a result, the MTE can be interpreted as the average effect of treatment for persons on a margin of indifference between participation in treatment and nonparticipation.

In the generalized Roy model, a LATE can be defined as an integral
over the MTEs (Heckman and Vytlacil 1999, 2005, 2007). In particular,
with a binary instrument (Z2 ∈ 0, 1) that shifts the propensity score from
PrðD 5 1jX 5 x, Z2 5 0Þ 5 p0 ðxÞ to PrðD 5 1jX 5 x, Z2 5 1Þ 5 p1 ðxÞ,
the LATE can be written as

B. Estimation Procedures
There are two estimation procedures for MTE. The separate estimation
approach identifies the components mj ðxÞ 1 kj ðp, xÞ separately for the
treated and the untreated, whereas LIV works directly with the differences
in these components across the two groups.
We first consider identification of MTE with LIV (see, e.g., Heckman
and Vytlacil 1999). This approach works with the population mean outcome given X and P(Z ). Conditioning on the propensity score and inserting the model for potential outcomes (2), we obtain
E ðY jP ðZ Þ 5 p, X 5 x Þ 5 ð1  p Þ½m0 ðx Þ 1 E ðU0 jUD > p, X 5 x Þ
1 p½m1 ðx Þ 1 E ðU1 jUD ≤ p, X 5 x Þ:

Since EðU0 jX 5 xÞ 5 0, we have
ð1 2 p ÞE ðU0 jUD > p, X 5 x Þ 5 2pE ðU0 jUD ≤ p, X 5 x Þ,
giving
E ðU0 jUD > p, X 5 x Þ 5 2

The MTE equals the following derivative:

with k defined in equation (4). This means that MTE(x, p) is identified
under assumption 1 over the support of P(Z ) conditional on X.
As an alternative to LIV, Heckman and Vytlacil (2007) discuss a separate
estimation approach to identify the MTE. For each treatment state, this
approach works with the population mean outcome given X and P(Z ).
From (2), we obtain

K1 ðp, x Þ 5 E ðU1 jUD ≤ p, X 5 x Þ

By differentiating K1 and K 0 with respect to p and rearranging, we get

Since
k ðp, x Þ 5 k1 ðp, x Þ 2 k0 ðp, x Þ,
under assumption 1, we can use the separate estimation to recover the
function k(p, x) and identify MTE(x, p) over the support of P(Z ) conditional on X.
With an instrument that generates continuous support of P(Z ) from
zero to one for each value of X, both LIV and the separate estimation approach nonparametrically identify the MTE over the full unit interval
(Heckman and Vytlacil 2007). In practice, however, instruments rarely
provide such support. Empirically, it is therefore difficult to apply these
procedures without imposing an additional assumption. For example,
the empirical analyses of Carneiro and Lee (2009), Carneiro et al. (2011),
and Maestas, Mullen, and Strand (2013) assume independence between
(U0, U1, UD) and (X, Z). Under this assumption, the MTE is additively separable in X and UD and therefore identified from the marginal support of
P(Z) as opposed to the support of P(Z) given X. An alternative (or ad-

ditional) assumption that is often made in applied research is to impose
restrictions on the functional form of k in the MTE model (see, e.g.,
Moffitt 2008; French and Song 2014). For example, Moffitt (2008) follows Heckman and Robb (1985) in specifying k as a polynomial (linear
or quadratic) function of p. Similarly, one could specify the functional
form of k0 and k1 in the separate estimation approach. A functional form
assumption aids identification by allowing interpolation between different values of p in the data or extrapolation beyond the support of P(Z )
given X. In the next section, we explore how such additional assumptions provide identification of the MTE when the instrument is discrete.
III. Identifying MTE with a Discrete Instrument
In this section, we show how a discrete instrument can be used to identify
the MTE under a functional structure that allows for treatment heterogeneity among individuals with the same observed characteristics and
self-selection based on the unobserved gain from treatment.
A.

Identification in a Nonseparable Model

Throughout subsections III.A and III.B, we invoke assumption 1. Without loss of generality, we keep the conditioning on X implicit and hence
take Z 5 Z2.
To fix ideas, we begin with an example showing how the separate estimation approach can identify a linear MTE model with a single binary instrument.
Example 1. The following equations specify a linear MTE model:
1
k0 ðp Þ 5 a0 p 2 a0
2
and
1
k 1 ðp Þ 5 a1 p 2 a1 ,
2
where the constant terms ensure that the marginal expectations of U1
and U0 are zero.7
From these expressions, we derive
ð

E ðU1 jUD 5 u Þdu 5 a1 ðp 2 1Þ,
K1 ðp Þ 5
p 0
2
7
This specification of the MTE model is consistent with that in Olsen (1980), which proposes a selection correction model based on the linear probability model, assuming that UD
is uniform and that EðUj jUD Þ is linear in UD.

Recall that LIV is based on the integrated MTE in equation (12). Although the MTE model is linear in p, equation (12) is quadratic in p. With
a binary instrument, the empirical analogue of EðY jP ðZ Þ 5 pÞ is observed for only two different values of p. Thus, LIV cannot identify the linear MTE model with a binary instrument.
The separate estimation approach is based on equations (10) and (11).
Both equations are linear in p. With a binary instrument, the empirical
analogues of EðY jP ðZ Þ 5 p, D 5 1Þ and EðY jP ðZ Þ 5 p, D 5 0Þ are observed for two different values of p. As a result, the separate estimation
approach identifies m0, m1, a0, and a1 and thus recovers the MTE with a
binary instrument. □

Geometry of the Linear MTE Model and LATE

Figure 1 illustrates the basic geometry of the linear MTE model and how
it relates to LATE. The y-axis measures the outcome of interest, whereas
the x-axis measures p. Recall that UD has been normalized to be unit uniform, so that tracing MTE over the unit interval shows how the effect of
treatment varies with different quantiles of the unobserved component
of selection into treatment.

F IG . 1.—This figure shows the geometry of the linear MTE model and LATE. We consider a binary instrument with associated propensity scores p0 5 0:4 and p1 5 0:8. The four
circles indicate the expected outcome for each combination of treatment state and instrument value. The dashed line that goes through the two conditional expectations for the
treated observations identifies the line m1 1 K1 ðpÞ. The dashed line that goes through the
two conditional expectations for the untreated observations identifies the line m0 1 K 0 ðpÞ.
The solid line m1 1 k1 ðpÞ has twice the slope as the dashed line m1 1 K1 ðpÞ. The solid line m0 1
k0 ðpÞ has twice the slope as the dashed line m0 1 K 0 ðpÞ. Note that k0 ð1Þ 5 K 0 ð1Þ and k1 ð0Þ 5
K1 ð0Þ. We identify MTE from the vertical difference between the solid lines at a given value
UD 5 p, that is, MTEðpÞ 5 m1 2 m0 1 k1 ðpÞ 2 k 0 ðpÞ. The LATE is given by the integrated
MTE over the interval (p0, p1), which equals the vertical distance between the solid lines at
the midpoint of the interval (p0, p1), indicated by the vertical dotted line. The parameterization values used are m 0 1 K0 ðpÞ 5 0:5 2 0:5p and m1 1 K1 ðpÞ 5 0:3 1 0:25p.

In this example, we consider a binary instrument with associated propensity score values of p1 5 0.8 and p0 5 0.4. In the data, we observe the
average outcome for each combination of treatment state and value of
the instrumental variable. From these averages we identify the four corresponding conditional expectations, indicated by circles in figure 1.

k0 ð1Þ 5 K 0 ð1Þ and k 1 ð0Þ 5 K1 ð0Þ.
The MTE is given by the vertical difference between the solid lines at a
given value UD 5 p, that is, MTEðpÞ 5 m1 2 m0 1 k 1 ðpÞ 2 k 0 ðpÞ. In this
example, the MTE is negative for UD < 0:5 and positive for UD > 0:5.
By way of comparison, constant MTE would imply that the solid lines
were parallel. The LATE produced by Z2 is given by the integrated
MTE over the interval (p0, p1), which equals the vertical distance between
the solid lines at the midpoint of this interval. If the MTEs were constant,
the vertical distance between the solid lines would be the same at all
points UD ∈ ½0, 1. However, because the MTEs are nonconstant, different
instruments would generally identify different LATEs.

Identifying MTE with a Discrete Instrument

Proposition 1 states the general identification result for a discrete instrument under conditional independence.
Proposition 1. Suppose that assumption 1 holds. Assume that P(Z )
takes N values, p1, ... , pN ∈ (0, 1). Assume further that k, k1, and k0 are specified as parametric functions, linear in parameters, with L parameters.
i. Using EðY jP ðZ Þ 5 p, X 5 xÞ, the MTEs can be identified only if
L ≤ N 2 1.
ii. Using EðY1 jP ðZ Þ 5 p, X 5 x, D 5 1Þ and EðY0 jP ðZ Þ 5 p, X 5 x,
D 5 0Þ, the MTEs can be identified only if L ≤ N.
The proof is given in Appendix A.
The proposition shows what LIV and the separate estimation approach
may identify under conditional independence. If we impose restrictions
on k1 and k 0, the separate estimation approach allows identification of
richer specifications of the MTE when the instrument is discrete. For instance, example 1 showed that when the instrument is binary, the separate estimation approach can (and LIV cannot) identify an MTE model
in which k1 and k0 are specified as linear functions of p. Alternatively, a binary instrument could be used in the separate estimation approach to
identify an MTE model in which k0 and k1 are linear functions of F21 ðpÞ,
where F is the distribution function of the standard normal distribution,
as in the normal selection model (see, e.g., Björklund and Moffitt 1987).
The parametric specification of k0 and k1 can be relaxed with two (or more)
instruments or one instrument that takes on multiple values. For example,
with an instrument that takes three unique values, the separate estimation approach can identify an MTE model in which k0 and k1 are specified
as quadratic functions of p or F21 ðpÞ.8

Proposition 1 shows the maximum number of parameters one can identify under conditional independence. The sufficient conditions for identification are specific to the mod-

B. Extrapolating and Testing the External
Validity of LATE
Recent work has proposed several tests of the external validity of LATE
(see, e.g., Heckman and Schmierer 2010; Heckman et al. 2010; Angrist
and Fernandez-Val 2013). All these tests require either two (or more) instruments or one instrument that takes on multiple values. We now propose a complementary test that even with a binary instrument has power
against the alternative hypothesis of a nonconstant MTE.
Suppose that Z ∈ {0, 1} such that P ð1Þ 5 p1 and P ð0Þ 5 p0 , with p1 ∈
ð0, 1Þ and p0 ∈ ð0, 1Þ. Assume that Z is relevant, so that p1 ≠ p0 . The definition of LATE in equation (5) can be rewritten as

Equation (13) is useful because the linear MTE model is estimated by

P(Z ) are sufficient to identify an MTE model with a polynomial of order N 2 1 (e.g., see
example 1). By comparison, if kj is specified as a piecewise linear function of p, it is necessary to have unique values of P(Z ) at every line segment to identify the MTE over the full
unit interval. We refer to Brinch, Mogstad, and Wiswall (2012) for a discussion of sufficient
conditions for identification.

However, the separate estimation approach offers more than the standard IV estimator: a simple test for the external validity of the LATE and
a linear extrapolation. Specifically, if the slope in the linear MTE model
is nonzero so that the MTEs are nonconstant, we reject the external validity of the LATE. In such situations, we may conclude that the LATE
estimate is informative only if the instrument-induced effect of treatment is the parameter of interest.
The test for external validity of LATE is simple to implement and does
not require estimation of the linear MTE model. In the linear MTE model,
testing the null hypothesis of constant MTE (i.e., U1 2 U0 is mean independent of UD) versus the alternative hypothesis of nonconstant MTE
is equivalent to testing the null hypothesis

(15)

It is easily seen from figure 1 that constant MTE in the linear model corresponds to equation (14).9 To implement this test, one can simply regress Y on D, Z and their interaction and perform a two-sided t-test on
the interaction coefficient. If there are covariates in the MTE model,
the regression can be performed conditional on X, and it is straightforward to test jointly for whether the MTE is constant for every value of X.
In the above test for external validity, we specified k0 and k1 as linear
functions of p and then tested constant MTE versus the alternative of
nonconstant MTE. In Appendix B, we consider two ways in which the linearity restrictions in k0 and k1 can be relaxed. We first provide a test in
which k0 and k1 are specified as monotonic quadratic functions of p. Next,
we consider a test in which all we assume is that k0 and k1 are monotonic
functions of p. In both cases, the null hypothesis of constant MTE provides testable restrictions on (D0, D1). The choice of test involves a
trade-off between power and sensitivity to the specification of k0 and k1;

By comparison, testing for no selection bias is equivalent to testing whether D1 5 D0 5

linear model does not impose any restrictions on (D0, D1) without further restrictions such

weaker parametric assumptions on k0 and k1 provide weaker testable restrictions.10
C. Identification with Separability
In the absence of additional assumptions, proposition 1 shows that the
parametric specification of k1 and k0 will need to be restrictive when the
discrete instrument takes few values. This subsection demonstrates how
an auxiliary assumption allows us to relax parametric restrictions on k0
and k1 using the separate estimation approach. The auxiliary assumption
is as follows.
Assumption 2.
EðYj jUD , X 5 xÞ 5 mj ðx Þ 1 EðUj jUD Þ,

j 5 0, 1:

Assumption 2 implies that the conditional expectation function of
U1 2 U0 as a function of UD does not depend on X, so that the MTE is
additively separable in X and UD:11
MTEðx, p Þ 5 m1 ðx Þ  m0 ðx Þ 1 E ðU1 2 U0 jUD 5 p Þ:
Assumption 2 is weaker than additive separability between D and X, as
imposed in equation (1), which is a standard auxiliary assumption in applied work using IV.12 Furthermore, assumptions 1 and 2 are implied by
(but do not imply) full independence (Z , X ? U1 , U0 , UD ), a common assumption in applied work estimating MTE (see, e.g., Carneiro and Lee
2009; Carneiro et al. 2011; Maestas et al. 2013).
A natural question is whether the separability assumption can be motivated by or is consistent with what is known or typically assumed about
technology or preferences. Consider, for example, the literature on production function estimation. Suppose we study a production function for
which Yj is an output and X and Uj are input factors. Assumption 2 is then
implied by perfect substitutability between the X and Uj inputs. By comparison, if Yj, X, and Uj are measured in logs, assumption 2 is implied
by unit elasticity between observable and unobservable inputs, as in the
10
If the instrument takes more than two values, the parametric specification of k1 and k0
can be further relaxed. See also Heckman and Schmierer (2010) and Heckman et al. (2010)
for tests in situations with continuous instruments.
11
We could also relax the separability assumption to a subset of observable characteristics, so that the conditional expectation function of U1 2 U0 as a function of UD is allowed
to depend on some (but not all) of the X variables. This would be achieved by performing
the MTE estimation conditional on certain observable characteristics.
12
Assumption 2 is weaker because it allows the treatment effects to vary by X and UD,
though not by the interaction of the two terms. By comparison, most applied work using
IV assumes additive separability between D and X, as in eq. (1), which constrains the treatment effects to be the same for all values of X. This assumption implies not only that
EðYj jX , UD Þ 5 mj ðX Þ 1 EðUj jUD Þ but also that m1 ðX Þ 5 m0 ðX Þ.

Cobb-Douglas technology. More generally, assumption 2 is compatible
with a production technology in which unobserved productivity differences across agents are factor neutral, which is a standard assumption
in methods of production function estimation (see, e.g., Olley and Pakes
1996; Levinsohn and Petrin 2003).13
In settings in which the separability assumption can be justified, we can
use the separate estimation approach to relax the parametric restriction
on k1 and k0. Example 2 illustrates what can and cannot be identified under assumptions 1 and 2. For simplicity, we consider a case with a single
binary instrument, a single binary covariate, and k0 and k1 specified as
quadratic functions of p.
Example 2. Consider first the case without any covariates. The following equations specify a quadratic MTE model:

As shown in proposition 1, with only a binary instrument, neither LIV
nor the separate estimation approach identifies the quadratic MTE model.
Suppose we introduce a single binary covariate to the model, X ∈ {0, 1}.
With a binary instrument Z2 ∈ {0, 1}, assumptions 1 and 2 give us four
values of p for the treated and the untreated: P ð1, 1Þ 5 p1 , P ð0, 1Þ 5
p2 , P ð1, 0Þ 5 p3 , and P ð0, 0Þ 5 p4 , where P(z2, x) denotes PrðD 5

p1 ≠ p2 and p3 ≠ p4 .
The LIV approach is based on the equation

1 px ðm11 2 m01 Þ 1 K ðp Þ:
In this equation, we have six parameters (m00, m01, m10 2 m00, m11 2 m01, a11 2
a01, and a12 2 a02) but only four values of p. This means that LIV cannot
identify a quadratic MTE model with a binary Z2 and a binary X. In fact,
the inclusion of X does not allow for identification of even a linear MTE
model.
The separate estimation approach is based on the equations

In each equation, we have four parameters and data that allow us to evaluate the expectation for four values of p. This means that the separate
estimation approach identifies a quadratic MTE model with a binary Z2
and a binary X.
There is one exception to the conclusion in the above paragraph. Explicit specification of the linear equation system necessary to solve for
the parameters in (16) and (17) shows that the parameters are uniquely

Geometry of MTE with Separability

Under assumptions 1 and 2, the MTE is additively separable in X and UD
and therefore identified from the marginal support of P(Z ) as opposed to
the support of P(Z ) given X. Figure 2 uses the notation introduced in example 2 to illustrate how these assumptions allow the separate estimation
approach to trace out the MTE across different observable characteristics X. As in example 2, we consider the case with a single binary instrument, a single binary covariate, and kj specified as a quadratic function
of p.
In the data, we observe the average outcome for each combination of
treatment state, the instrument, and the covariate. From these averages
we identify the corresponding conditional expectations, displayed for
the treated as circles in panel A of figure 2. From the conditional expectations, we know the average derivative of K1 in the interval (0.2, 0.4) and
the average derivative of K1 in the interval (0.5, 0.8). Because k1 is a quadratic function, the derivative of K1 is linear in p and we know the derivative at the midpoint of each interval. Panel B of figure 2 displays the derivative of K1 at these midpoints. In the separate estimation approach,
the dashed line that goes through the two points identifies a11 and a12.
In the same way, this approach identifies a01 and a02 from the average
outcomes associated with the four values of the propensity score for the untreated. To identify the quadratic MTE model, we solve for the parameters
in (16) and (17) for each value of X and recover (m00, m01, m10, m11).
2.

Identifying MTE with a Discrete Instrument

Example 2 showed how the separate estimation approach allows us to
identify a quadratic MTE model with a single binary instrument and a
single binary covariate. Proposition 2 states the general identification
result for a discrete instrument under separability and conditional independence.
Proposition 2. Suppose assumptions 1 and 2 hold. Assume that X
takes on M different values and Z takes on N different values for each
X, giving MN values of P(Z ), p1, ... , pMN ∈ (0, 1). Assume further that k,
k1, and k0 are specified as parametric functions, linear in parameters,
with L parameters.
i. Using EðY jP ðZ Þ 5 p, X 5 xÞ, the MTEs can be identified only if
L ≤ ðN 2 2ÞM 1 1.
ii. Using EðY1 jP ðZ Þ 5 p, X 5 x, D 5 1Þ and EðY0 jP ðZ Þ 5 p, X 5 x,
D 5 0Þ, the MTEs can be identified only if L ≤ ðN 2 1ÞM 1 1.
The proof is given in Appendix A.

The proposition shows what LIV and the separate estimation approach
can identify under conditional independence and separability. If we impose restrictions on k1 and k0, the separate estimation approach can identify richer specifications of the MTE when the instrument is discrete. The
reason is that the separability assumption allows us to combine information about the shapes of k1 and k0 across different values of X. In situations
in which X or Z takes many values, the specification of the MTE may be
relatively flexible as k1 and k0 may take a large number of parameters.
However, even in cases in which P(Z ) is continuous because X contains
a continuous component, it may be necessary to specify k1 and k0 as parametric functions taking a finite number of parameters. The reason is that
it is also necessary to control for X in equation (9). By comparison, if P(Z )
is continuous because Z is continuous for each X, then the MTE can be
nonparametrically identified (Heckman and Vytlacil 1999).
D. Discussion
The above propositions are useful in making precise what can and cannot be identified with discrete instruments. At the same time, they raise a
number of questions. What choices have to be made to estimate the
MTE with a discrete instrument, and how can one examine the sensitivity of results to these choices? Are there restrictions on the joint distribution of (U0, U1, UD) that will imply a specific parametric MTE model? Can
the specified MTE model be interpreted as an approximation as opposed to being exactly correct?

Empirical Specification and Sensitivity Checks

In thinking about model specification and sensitivity checks, it is useful
to note that without any normalization of UD, kj can be written as
kj ðp Þ 5 EðUj jFU ðUD Þ 5 pÞ ; EðUj jUD 5 FU21 ðp ÞÞ,

where FU is the strictly increasing distribution function of UD. Define the
conditional expectation of Uj as a function of UD as gj ðuÞ 5 EðUj jUD 5 uÞ.

For any choice of FU , one can obtain any function kj by setting gj ðuÞ 5
kj ðFU ðuÞÞ. This means that the specification of UD is simply a normalization that has no implications for statements we would make about the
MTE.
What matters for the empirical MTE model is how we specify kj. In the
empirical analysis, we examine the sensitivity of the results to different

choices of kj. For example, our baseline model under separability specifies kj as local polynomials of p. We probe the stability of the baseline results to several alternative specifications. We report results in which kj is
specified as different functions of p, including splines, global polynomial
series, and global Fourier series. Additionally, we examine how the results change if kj is specified as a polynomial function of F21 ðpÞ, where
F is the distribution function of the standard normal distribution. It is
reassuring to find that our results are robust to the empirical specification of the MTE model.
2.

Parametric Structure and Distribution
of Unobservables

Following Heckman and Robb (1985), empirical studies often specify
the MTE model as a global polynomial function of p. A natural question
is then, What restrictions on the joint distribution of (U0, U1, UD) imply
that kj will be a global polynomial of a given order?
The class of distributions of (U0, U1, UD) implying that kj is a polynomial
in FU21 ðpÞ is characterized by

Different subclasses give different specifications of kj. One example is
the joint distributions of (U0, U1, UD) that belong to the subclass of elliptically symmetric distributions (Fang, Kotz, and Ng 1990). In this case, kj
will be linear in FU21 ðpÞ. One member of this subclass is jointly normally
distributed (U0, U1, UD), in which case kj is linear in FU21 ðpÞ 5 F21 ðpÞ, as
in the normal selection model. Another example is the subclass of distributions for which Uj 5 aj p 1 Wj . In this case, kj is linear in FU21 ðpÞ 5 p, as

Approximating Model

In some settings with discrete instruments, it may be useful to think of
the empirical specification of the MTE model being an approximation
as opposed to being exactly correct.14

Standard approximation results for linear regression models cannot be directly applied (e.g., White 1980). To see this, recall that we are estimating EðY1 jUD ≤ p, X 5 xÞ and

In Appendix C, we consider how the analysis is affected if the empirical specification of kj is an approximating model. In particular, suppose
that the true model of kj is a polynomial in FU21 ðpÞ of order M2, whereas
the empirical model of kj is a polynomial in FU21 ðpÞ of order M1 < M2 .
This appendix provides a limit statement of the distance between the
true model and the probability limit of the empirical model. For example, if k1 ðpÞ 5 a0 1 a1 p 1 a2 p 2 in the true model and we estimate a linear model with k1 ðpÞ 5 b0 1 b1 p, then the probability limits of the estimators of b0 and b1 approach a0 and a1 at the same rate as a2 goes to
zero. This means that if the MTE is approximately linear, as in the empirical analysis of Carneiro et al. (2011), then the approximation error
from specifying k0 and k1 as linear functions of p will be small.

who were between ages 16 and 74 at some point during the period 1986–
2000. The family and demographic files are merged by unique individual
identifiers with detailed information about educational attainment reported annually by Norwegian educational establishments. The data also
contain identifiers that allow us to match parents to their children. As we
observe each child’s date of birth, we are able to construct birth order indicators for every child in each family. We refer to Black et al.’s study for a
more detailed description of the data as well as of relevant institutional
details for Norway.
We follow the sample selection used in Black et al. (2005). We begin by
restricting the sample to children who were aged at least 25 in 2000 to
make it likely that most individuals in our sample have completed their
education. Twins at first parity are excluded from the estimation sample
because of the difficulty of assigning birth order to these children. To increase the chances of measuring completed family size, we drop families
with children aged less than 16 in 2000. We exclude a small number of
children with more than five siblings as well as a handful of families in
which the mother had a birth before she was age 16 or after she was 49.

The best linear approximations of the former functions are generally not the best linear
approximations of the latter functions (and therefore not of the MTE).

In addition, we exclude a few children for whom their own or their mother’s education is missing. Rather than dropping the larger number of observations for which information on fathers is missing, we include a separate category of missing for father’s education and father’s age.
As in Black et al. (2005), our measure of family size is the number of
children born to each mother. Throughout the empirical analysis, we follow much of the previous literature in focusing on the treatment effect on
a firstborn child from being in a family with two or more siblings rather
than one sibling. The outcome of interest is the child’s years of schooling,
which is often used as a proxy for child quality. The child’s education is
collected from year 2000, while parental education is measured at age 16
of the child.
In line with much of the previous literature on family size and child
outcomes, we use the following two instruments: twin birth and samesex sibship. The twins instrument is a dummy for a multiple second birth
(second- and third-born children are twins). The validity of this instrument rests on the assumptions that the occurrence of a multiple birth
is as good as random and that a multiple birth affects child development
solely by increasing fertility. The same-sex instrument is a dummy variable
equal to one if the two first children in a family have the same sex. This
instrument is motivated by the fact that parents with two children are
more likely to have a third child if the first two are of the same sex than
if sex composition is mixed. The validity of the same-sex instrument rests
on the assumptions that sibling sex composition is essentially random
and that it affects child development solely by increasing fertility. It
should be emphasized that our focus is not on the validity of these instruments: Our aim is to move beyond the LATE of family size, applying commonly used instruments. We refer to Black et al. (2005) and Angrist et al.
(2010) for empirical evidence in support of the validity of the instruments.
Our sample consists of 514,004 firstborn children with at least one sibling. Table 1 displays basic descriptive statistics. In 50 percent of the sample, there are at least three children in the family, and the average family
size is 2.7 children. There are a few noticeable differences between children from a family with only one sibling and those with two or more siblings. As expected, parents with two children are more likely to have a
third child if the first two are of the same sex than if sex composition is
mixed. Furthermore, the second- and third-born children are twins in
about 1 percent of the families. It is also evident that firstborn children
with one sibling have higher educational attainment than firstborn children with two or more siblings, pointing to a negative association between
family size and child quality. However, parents with more children tend to
be less educated and younger at first birth, suggesting that we need to be
cautious in giving the association between family size and child quality a
causal interpretation.

Note.—Descriptive statistics are for 514,004 children. All children are firstborn with at
least one sibling. Twins at first birth are excluded from the sample. All children, parents,
and siblings are aged between 16 and 74 years at some point between 1986 and 2000.

B. Fertility Decision Model
Table 2 presents estimates of the average marginal effects from a logit
model for the choice of having three or more children (instead of two
children). In terms of the choice model defined by (3), ID represents
the net benefit from having another child, which is assumed to depend
on an unobserved component, the covariates, and the instrument(s) listed
in table 1. Recall that we do not assume that the covariates are exogenous;
what we assume is that the instruments are independent of the unobservables conditional on the covariates. The twins instrument is interacted
with all other variables to ensure that the propensity score is one in the
event of a twin birth.
The instruments are (individually and jointly) strong predictors of
family size. The average effect of a twin birth is almost 0.52. This means
that nearly 48 percent of mothers with twins at second parity would have
had a third birth anyway. We also see that parents of same-sex sibship are,
on average, about 5.7 percentage points more likely to have a third birth
than parents of mixed-sex sibship. It is also evident that families with
three or more children were decreasing over the period we study, which
is reflected in the sizable marginal effect of child’s age in the year 2000.
Mother’s age at first birth is also predictive of family size: The propensity
score decreases by 2.2 percentage points if the mother is 1 year older at
the first birth.

Note.—This table reports the average partial effect (average treatment effect for binary variables) from a logit
model. The dependent variable is the probability of being
in a family with two or more siblings rather than one sibling. All covariates in the table enter the model linearly.
In addition, we add second- and third-order terms in age
in 2000, mother’s age at first birth, father’s age at first
birth, mother’s years of schooling, and father’s years of
schooling. We also include interactions between the firstorder terms of all covariates. The instrument same sex,
first and second children enters the model without interaction terms. The instrument twins at second parity is interacted with all covariates (including higher-order terms and
interactions) to ensure that the model is consistent with
the fact that there are no never-takers with twins. Standard
errors in parentheses are computed by nonparametric
bootstrap with 100 bootstrap replications.

C. IV Estimates
Following Black et al. (2005), we specify the following outcome equation
(second stage):
Y 5 m 1 bD 1 X 0 d 1 e,

(20)

where Y denotes the child’s years of schooling, X is a vector of controls
for (predetermined) child and parental characteristics, and e is the error
term. In line with much of the previous literature, throughout the empirical analysis we will focus on the treatment effect on a firstborn child from
being in a family with two or more siblings (D 5 1) rather than one sibling
(D 5 0). Table 3 shows how IV estimates of the effects of family size vary
in magnitude and even sign with the choice of instrument. In every specification, we include the same vector of observables Z 5 (X, Z2) in the
first-stage equations. What we change is the instrument(s) excluded from
the outcome equation (Z2).
In column 1, we follow Carneiro et al. (2011) in performing linear IV
with P(Z) as the instrument. We construct P(Z ) using the parameter esti-

Note.—This table reports OLS and IV estimates of the effect of family size on the educational attainment of firstborn children. Column 1 reports linear IV estimates with P(Z )
as instrument. We construct P(Z ) using the parameter estimates from the logit model with
average derivatives reported in table 2. Column 2 reports standard linear IV estimates with
Z2 as instrument. We use the same specification for the covariates as reported in table 2.
The first row excludes the same sex, first and second children instrument from the second
stage, the second row excludes the twins at second parity instrument from the second
stage, and the third row excludes both instruments from the second stage. The OLS estimate of the second-stage specification (20) is reported in the fourth row. Standard errors

mates from the logit model, for which average marginal effects are reported in table 2. When excluding the same-sex instrument from the
outcome equation, we estimate that being in a family with two or more
siblings rather than one sibling lowers the educational attainment of firstborn children by 0.208 year. If instead we exclude the twins instrument
from the outcome equation, we still find a negative point estimate but
cannot reject no effect of family size at conventional significance levels.
When we exclude both instruments from the outcome equation, the IV
estimate is close to zero. Indeed, the LATE based on both instruments
is significantly different from the LATE based on the same-sex (twins)
instrument at the 5 (10) percent significance level.15 The fact that the
LATEs vary significantly with the choice of excluded instrument indicates
nonconstant MTEs.
In column 2, we follow Black et al. (2005) in using a standard linear IV
procedure with Z2 as the excluded instruments. While the effect of family
size induced by twins is only 0.050, the effect based on the same-sex instrument is as large as 0.174. The IV estimates in columns 1 and 2 are consistent under the same assumptions (Carneiro et al. 2011). However, as
P(Z ) incorporates interactions between the controls and the instrument
in the fertility choice, the LATE of a P(Z ) shift in D does not need to be

same as the LATE of a Z2 shift in D. Indeed, the IV estimates differ substantially between columns 1 and 2.
D. MTE Weights of Treatment Parameters
As a first step toward understanding why the IV estimates vary so much with
the choice of excluded instrument, we estimate the distribution of weights
across the MTEs. Figure 3 displays the distribution of weights for the IV estimates and compares them to the distribution of weights of the ATE, the
ATT, and the ATUT (average treatment effect on the untreated). The expressions and interpretations for these weights are provided in Heckman
and Vytlacil (2007). The y-axis measures the density of the distribution of
weights, whereas the x-axis measures the unobserved component UD of parents’ net gain from having three or more children (D 5 1) rather than two

Panels b and c graph MTE weights associated with the IV estimates presented in table 3. The
formulas for these weights are provided in Heckman and Vytlacil (2007). The y-axis measures the density of the distribution of weights, whereas the x-axis represents the unobserved
component of parents’ net gain from having three or more children rather than two children. A high value of p means that a family is less likely to have three or more children.

children (D 5 0). Recall that a high value of UD means that a family is less
likely to have three or more children.
There are clear patterns in the distribution of weights. First, the IV estimates based on the twins instrument assign more weight to individuals
with high values of UD as compared to the IV estimates based on the samesex instrument. This pattern is quite intuitive: With twin births, even families very unlikely to have another child are induced to increase family
size; with same-sex sibship, the complier group consists of parents whose
preference for mixed-sex sibship induces them to have a third child. Indeed, there are no never-takers with twins, which gives support on p 5 1.
This explains why the twins instrument assigns weights to individuals with
high values of UD.
Second, both ATT and ATE assign much more weight to families who
are likely to have another child as compared to the IV estimates. In contrast, ATUT and the IV estimates based on the twins instrument assign
most of the weight to families unlikely to have another child. This pattern
is also quite intuitive. With twins there are no never-takers, so the untreated
consist only of compliers with the twins instrument switched off. If the
occurrence of a twin birth is as good as random (conditional on covariates), the LATE for the twin birth compliers should therefore be equal
to the ATUT. This explains why the distribution of weights with the twins
instrument closely mirrors the distribution of weights for the ATUT.
E. Nonparametric Bounds
The sensitivity of the LATEs of family size to the choice of excluded instrument raises concerns about their policy-relevant and external validity.
One possible response is to abandon the goal of point identification and
instead construct bounds on conventional treatment parameters. In Appendix E, we derive nonparametric bounds on the ATE and the ATT of
family size.
A natural starting point is the worst-case (or no-assumption) bounds
(see Manski 1989). To construct these bounds, we exploit that the dependent variable—years of schooling—is bounded between 6 and 21. As
shown in the first row of Appendix table E1, the worst-case bounds are
very wide and therefore not informative about the effects of family size.
In the other rows of table E1, we impose the IV assumptions of exclusion,
monotonicity, and relevance.16 Under these assumptions, we can estimate
16
Alternatively, one could invoke the monotone IV assumption (Manski and Pepper
2000). This assumption is a weakened form of the exclusion restriction. As a result, it will
necessarily produce wider bounds than the standard IV assumptions. Indeed, the monotone IV assumption does little to tighten the worst-case bounds in our setting.

the LATE, the average potential outcomes of always-takers if treated, and
the average potential outcomes of never-takers if nontreated. Taken together, these components allow us to construct bounds on the ATE
and the ATT. Unfortunately, the bounds are too wide to be informative
about the effects of family size on children’s schooling.
In principle, one could try to get tighter bounds by invoking the assumptions of monotone treatment response (Manski 1997) or monotone
treatment selection (Manski and Pepper 2000). The former assumption
requires that increasing family size does not raise children’s schooling;
the latter assumption states that children with fewer siblings would have
more schooling at each level of family size than children with more siblings. We have chosen not to invoke these assumptions, as theory is not
informative about the expected sign of the selection to or effects of additional siblings.
V. Empirical Analysis of Marginal Treatment Effects
We now examine the scope for moving beyond the LATEs of family size
by adopting a functional structure that allows for treatment heterogeneity among individuals with the same observed characteristics and selfselection based on the unobserved gain from treatment. We begin by using the separate estimation approach to estimate a linear MTE model
and use it to test the external validity of LATE. We next invoke the additional assumption of additive separability between observed and unobserved heterogeneity in treatment effects and estimate a flexible specification of the MTE model. For now, we exclude only the same-sex instrument
from the outcome equation, but we will later provide estimates excluding
both instruments.
In the separate estimation approach, the empirical MTE model is determined by the specification of k1 and k0. The MTEs can then be recovered from the empirical analogues of EðY jP ðZ Þ 5 p, X 5 x, D 5 1Þ,
EðY jP ðZ Þ 5 p, X 5 x, D 5 0Þ, and P(Z ). Regardless of whether parametric or nonparametric methods are used, it is necessary to specify a modeling framework for k0 and k1. Two key choices have to be made. The first
is to select a class of functions for k0 and k1. The second is to select the
number of parameters to estimate. This amounts to choosing bandwidth
in a local polynomial regression or selecting the number of terms in a series estimation.
In the first part of our empirical analysis, we assume conditional independence but not additive separability. As a result, the MTE is identified
from the support of P(Z ) given X as opposed to the marginal support of
P(Z ). With a binary instrument, we then need to specify k1 and k0 as parametric functions of p with no more than two parameters in each function.

Our baseline specification normalizes UD to be unit uniform and specifies
k0 and k1 as linear functions of p.
In the second part of our empirical analysis, we assume conditional independence and separability. As a result, P(Z) takes a large number of
unique values for both the treated and untreated. We can therefore be very
flexible in the specification of k0 and k1. Our baseline specification normalizes UD to be unit uniform and uses a local quadratic estimator in which the
bandwidths are selected using the “leave one out” cross-validation method.17
In Section V.C, we perform a number of sensitivity checks, showing that
our results are robust to alternative specifications of kj.
A.

Linear MTE Model and External Validity of LATE

Table 4 displays results from an MTE model without covariates in which
k0 and k1 are linear in p and (U0, U1, UD) is independent of Z. Panel A
shows estimates of the intercept and the slope of the linear MTE model
as well as its underlying components; panel B reports the LATE derived
from the linear MTE model and compares it to the LATE estimated by
the standard linear IV procedure.
The results in table 4 illustrate that in situations with a binary instrument, the separate estimation approach gives an estimate of LATE from
the linear MTE model that is numerically equivalent to the estimate of
LATE from standard IV estimation. By applying the standard IV estimator, we obtain the following estimate of the LATE of family size on children’s education:

See Ichimura and Todd (2007) for a discussion of choice of bandwidth. If the propensity score takes enough values to identify the true MTE model, cross-validation will pick the
correct model with probability approaching one as the sample size grows. The standard
t -tests will therefore be asymptotically valid, even after model selection. However, the usual
finite sample issues of inference after model selection still apply, as the asymptotic distribution may not approximate the finite sample distribution well. See Leeb and Pötscher (2005)
for a discussion.

By comparison to the standard IV estimator, estimates of the linear
MTE model from the separate estimation approach offer more: a simple
test for the external validity of the LATE. Table 4 shows that the slope of
the linear MTE model is different from zero at conventional significance
levels. We therefore reject the external validity of LATE, which suggests
that it is informative only about the same-sex-induced effect of family size.
If we extrapolate the linear MTE estimate, we obtain an ATE of 20.016
and an ATT of 0.48. However, we do not put much stock in these extrapolations, given the nonlinear pattern that we find in the analysis with separability.
Recall that our test for the external validity of LATE can actually be
performed without estimating the linear MTE model. In the linear MTE
model, testing the null hypothesis of constant MTEs versus the alternative
hypothesis of nonconstant MTEs is equivalent to testing whether
E ðY jD 5 1, Z 5 1Þ 2 E ðY jD 5 1, Z 5 0Þ
5 E ðY jD 5 0, Z 5 1Þ 2 E ðY jD 5 0, Z 5 0Þ
versus a two-sided alternative. To perform the test, we regress Y on D, Z and
their interaction. On the basis of the two-sided t-test on the interaction coefficient, we reject the null hypothesis of a constant MTE at the 1 percent
significance level (p-value .0001).
There are two caveats to the rejection of the external validity of the
LATE. The first is that the same-sex instrument may be correlated with variables other than family size. If these variables affect children’s education,
then Z depends on (U0, U1, UD), implying that the results reported in table 4
are biased. We address this concern by controlling for the set of covariates
listed in table 1. Specifically, we partition our sample into 64 groups based
on these covariates and estimate the linear MTE model separately for
each group. Although most of the LATEs are too imprecisely estimated
to draw firm conclusions about the covariate-specific effects of family size,
we find that the slopes of the linear MTE models are jointly different from

zero at the 10 percent significance level (p-value .064). This suggests that
the rejection of the external validity of the LATE is unlikely to be driven
by differences in observables across families with same-sex and mixedsex sibship.
The second caveat is that the test of external validity relies on k1 and k0
being specified as linear functions of p. As usual, the test is not valid if
the model is misspecified (i.e., k1 or k0 is not a linear function of p). Misspecification can lead us to falsely reject the null hypothesis of constant
MTE, and it can make us fail to correctly reject the null hypothesis of constant MTE. In Appendix B, we consider two ways in which the linearity restrictions in k0 and k1 can be relaxed. We first provide a test in which k1 and
k0 are specified as monotonic quadratic functions of p. Our results show
that in this case we also can reject the null hypothesis of constant MTE in
favor of the alternative of nonconstant MTE at the 1 percent significance
level (p - value .0016). Next, we consider a test in which we assume that
k1 and k0 are only monotonic functions of p. In this case, there is not
enough power to reject the null hypothesis of constant MTE at conventional levels of significance.
B. Flexible MTE Model with Separability
If we are willing to assume only that (U0, U1, UD) is independent of Z given
X (assumption 1), then a binary instrument identifies a linear MTE model
only. This means that unless one is willing to use the linear MTE model to
extrapolate, it is not possible to recover the MTE over a wide range of UD. As
an alternative to such a linear extrapolation, we proceed by invoking the
additional assumption of additive separability between observed and unobserved heterogeneity in treatment effects (assumption 2).
Figure 4 shows the empirical support of P ðZ Þ ; PrðD 5 1jZ Þ under
assumptions 1 and 2, using same-sex as the excluded instrument for family size. The common support is defined as the intersection of the support of P(Z ) given D 5 1 and the support of P(Z ) given D 5 0. As for
the IV estimates reported in table 3, we construct P(Z ) using the parameter estimates from the logit model for which average marginal effects
are reported in table 2. We see that assumptions 1 and 2 yield substantial
support in the interval (0.20, 0.75). We do not, however, obtain substantial support outside this interval, which implies that we cannot identify
MTE as UD approaches zero or one. Following Carneiro et al. (2011),
we trim our data by dropping observations for which the estimated P(Z)
is below 0.209 or above 0.751, which correspond to the 0.01 and 0.99 percentiles in the distributions of P(Z) for the treated and untreated, respectively.18

This sample restriction barely moves our MTE estimates.

F IG . 4.—Histogram of propensity scores for the treated (solid) and the untreated (dotted), with same-sex instrument as the excluded instrument. This histogram shows the empirical support of P ðZ Þ ; PrðD 5 1jZ Þ under assumptions 1 and 2, with same-sex as the
excluded instrument. The common support is defined as the intersection of the support
of P(Z ) given D 5 1 (solid) and the support of P(Z) given D 5 0 (dotted). We construct
P(Z ) using the parameter estimates from the logit model specified in the note to table 2.

Under assumptions 1 and 2, the MTE is additively separable in X and UD
and therefore identified from the marginal support of P(Z) as opposed to
the support of P(Z) given X. This allows us to be very flexible in the specification of k0 and k1. In particular, we have 32,446 (33,093) unique values for the pairs of PrðD 5 1jX 5 x, Zsamesex 5 0Þ and PrðD 5 1jX 5 x,
Zsamesex 5 1Þ for the treated (untreated). As a result, in principle we can
identify an MTE model with more than 32,000 parameters in the specification of both k1 and k0. We therefore think of P(Z ) as taking enough values that we can interpret the local quadratic model as an exact specification with no approximation error.
Our baseline model uses an estimation procedure that follows closely
the approach used in Heckman et al. (2006) and Carneiro et al. (2011).
The first step is to estimate P(Z ). We obtain P^ ðZ Þ from the parameter
estimates of the logit model reported in table 2. Our specification is
quite flexible, and alternative functional form specifications for the
choice model (e.g., probit or linear probability model) produce results sim-

ilar to the ones reported here. The second step is to estimate m0(X), m1(X),
K0, and K1. To this end, we use the double residual regression method of
Robinson (1988) as modified by Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd (1997).
This amounts to first estimating m1(X) and m0(X), using the same specification as in the IV estimation of table 3, and next estimating the functions
^1 ðX Þ and Y0 2 m
^0 ðX Þ
K1 and K0 using local quadratic regression of Y1 2 m
on P^ ðZ Þ. The bandwidths are selected using the “leave one out” crossvalidation method.
Figure 5 displays how the MTE depends on UD, with 95 percent confidence intervals computed from a nonparametric bootstrap.19 The MTE
estimates are evaluated at mean values of X. Our estimates suggest that the
effects of family size vary in magnitude and even sign (i.e., b is heterogeneous) and that families act as if they possess some knowledge of their idiosyncratic return (b is correlated with D). Specifically, our estimates show
that an increase in family size raises the average educational attainment of
firstborn children in families with UD less than 0.40. This means that firstborn in families that are likely to have another child (in terms of their
unobservables) would gain from an increase in family size. The family size
effects are negative for values of UD in the interval (0.40, 0.62), indicating a
quantity-quality trade-off in families for whom preferences for mixedsibling sex composition play a more important role in the decision to have
another child. For values of UD above 0.62, the estimated MTEs are positive. This means that in families unlikely to have a third child (possibly because unobserved psychic or financial costs are too high), the educational
attainment of firstborn would benefit from an increase in family size.20
As in Carneiro, Heckman, and Vytlacil (2003), the MTE estimates show
a U shape and the magnitude of heterogeneity is substantial. This pattern could not be recovered by the traditional approach to estimating the
model of equations (2) and (3), which assumes that (U0, U1, UD) are jointly
normally distributed and independent of Z (see, e.g., Björklund and Moffitt 1987).21 In particular, the normal selection model may mask heterogeneity in the effects of family size if the population is segmented in preferences or constraints. For example, preference for mixed-sex sibships is
19
Heckman et al. (1997) show that bootstrap provides a better approximation to the
true standard errors than asymptotic standard errors for the estimation of the parameters
in a model similar to the one we present here. We use 100 bootstrap replications. Throughout the paper, in each iteration of the bootstrap we reestimate P(Z ) so all standard errors
account for the fact that P^ ðZ Þ is itself an estimated object.
20
The QQ model of fertility is consistent with both positive and negative effects of family
size depending on whether quantity and quality are complements or substitutes (Rosenzweig
and Wolpin 1980; Mogstad and Wiswall 2016). See also the discussion in App. D.
21
The normal selection model assumes that the MTE is either constant, monotonically
declining, or monotonically increasing in UD; the MTE tends toward ±∞ as UD tends toward
zero or one (unless the MTE is constant); and the distribution of MTE is symmetric in UD,
so that the slope of the MTE takes the same absolute value for UD 5 u and UD 5 1 2 u.

F IG . 5.—This figure displays the MTE estimates based on assumptions 1 and 2. We use
same-sex as the excluded instrument. The MTE estimates are evaluated at the mean values

unlikely to be manifested with equal force by all groups in the population.
Mixture distributions arise naturally when the population contains two or
more distinct subpopulations.
In Appendix D, we present a simple example of MTE in a mixture model
with two subpopulations of equal size. The population distribution of MTE
that is derived from this mixed model has a U shape: Individuals with high
MTE are overrepresented in the tails, whereas individuals with low MTE
tend to be in the middle ranges of UD. The reason is that the first subgroup
has a relatively high variance of UD: This could, for example, be due to
weaker preferences for mixed-sex sibship such that the unobserved component explains more of the variation in the choice of family size.
We have already discussed the rejection of the hypothesis that MTE is
constant in UD on the basis of the estimates of the linear MTE model, but

without invoking assumption 2. With this separability assumption, we can
test whether the MTE is constant in UD or not. We evaluate the MTE in five
intervals equally spaced between 0.22 and 0.72. As in Carneiro et al. (2011),
we construct pairs of intervals and compare the mean of the MTEs for each
pair. Table 5 reports the outcome of these comparisons. For example, column 1 reports
EðY1 2 Y0 jX 5 X , 0:22 ≤ UD ≤ 0:27Þ
2EðY1 2 Y0 jX 5 X , 0:31 ≤ UD ≤ 0:36Þ 5 1:102,
with a p-value of .034 for no difference in these LATEs. Table 6 shows that
most of the adjacent LATEs are different at conventional levels of significance. A joint test that the difference across all adjacent LATEs is different from zero has a p-value close to zero. This is further evidence that families select into family size on the basis of heterogeneous returns.
C. Summary Measures of Treatment Effects
As shown by Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2005, 2007), all conventional
treatment parameters can be expressed as different weighted averages of
the MTE. Recovering these treatment parameters from estimates of MTE,
however, requires full support of P(Z) on the unit interval. Since we do
not have full support of P(Z), we follow Carneiro et al. (2011) in rescaling
the weights so that they integrate to one over the region of common support.

Note.—This table reports rescaled support estimates of ATE and ATT of
family size on the educational attainment of firstborn children. We use estimates of MTE in the interval (0.209, 0.751) and rescale the weights to integrate
to one over this region. The MTE estimates are based on assumptions 1 and 2,
with same sex, first and second as the excluded instrument (see fig. 5). We
construct P(Z ) using the parameter estimates from the logit model specified
in the note to table 2. The MTE estimates are based on double residual regression separately for the treated and nontreated, using local quadratic regression with uniform kernel and bandwidth of 0.0615. Standard errors are based
on nonparametric bootstrap (of each estimation stage), with 100 bootstrap
replications.

We use the MTE estimates reported in figure 5 to construct rescaled estimates on the ATE and the ATT. Table 6 displays the lower rescaled support estimates. The rescaled support estimates are 0.474 for the ATE and
0.654 for the ATT. This evidence stands in stark contrast to the IV estimates reported in table 3, which range between 0.174 and 20.208. As
shown in figure 3, the reason is that the IV estimates assign much more
weight to the regions with negative MTE. This illustrates the need to be
cautious in going from the mean impact for compliers to the effects for
other parts of the population.

D. Sensitivity Analysis
1.

Model Validation Using the Twins Instrument

So far, we have excluded only the same-sex instrument from the outcome
equation in the MTE estimation. We now use the twins instrument to validate the MTE estimates based on the same-sex instrument, exploiting
the fact that the MTE is a functional that is invariant to the choice of instrument that is excluded from the potential outcome equations. If the
MTE estimates vary significantly with the choice of excluded instrument,
it would raise serious concerns about the validity of the instruments (or
assumption 2).
Figure 6 compares estimates of the MTE based on the same-sex instrument to those using both the same-sex and the twins instrument. In each
case, we use the estimation procedure as described above. In particular,
the specification of the choice model is fixed; what we change is the instrument(s) excluded from the outcome equation. In our baseline specification, the dummy variable for twin birth is included in both stages and the
same-sex dummy variable is the only excluded instrument. In the model

validation, we treat twin birth as an additional excluded instrument. It is
reassuring to find that the two MTE estimates display the same U-shaped
pattern. Indeed, the point estimates are very similar in magnitude. This
finding suggests that the differences in the IV estimates by the choice of
excluded instrument occur because of different weighting of the MTE
rather than invalidity of the instruments (or assumption 2).
A limitation with the validation exercise presented in figure 6 is that the
same-sex instrument could be driving both MTE estimates. To address this
concern, it would be useful to estimate the MTE separately for each excluded instrument. However, with twins there are no never-takers, so
the function k0 and thus the MTE cannot be identified under assumptions

1 and 2 from the twins instrument only. Nevertheless, we can use the twins
instrument to estimate the function k1 since there are both always-takers
and compliers. Figure 7 shows how the estimates of the function k1 vary
with the choice of excluded instrument. For each instrument, we use the
same estimation procedure as described above, keeping the specification
of the choice model fixed. The similarity in the estimates of k1 gives credibility to the MTE estimates reported in figure 5.

Fourier series, and a quadratic spline with eight knots22 (each specification uses 11 parameters for k1 and k0). The MTE estimates from these alternative estimators are very similar to the baseline results. In panel b, we
show results from the global polynomial specification with different orders. It is reassuring to find that the MTE estimates are very similar for
polynomial specifications with third- and higher-order terms. This suggests that the power series have a good approximation rate in our setting.
In panel c, we specify k0 and k1 as polynomials in F21 ðpÞ, providing a generalization of the normal selection model. This change to the empirical
MTE model barely moves the estimates. Taken together, these specification checks suggest that the MTE estimates are robust to changes in the
modeling framework for k0 and k1.
VI. Conclusions
The interpretation of IV estimates as LATE of instrument-induced shifts
in treatment raises concerns about their external validity and policy relevance. One road to go down in the search for external validity and policy
relevance is to estimate MTE, which have clear economic interpretation
and summarize all conventional treatment parameters. However, full identification of the MTE requires some form of parametric or functional restriction when the instrument is discrete, as it often is in applied research.
In this paper, we showed how a discrete instrument can be used to identify the MTE under functional structure that allows for treatment heterogeneity among individuals with the same observed characteristics and
self-selection based on the unobserved gain from treatment. One key result is that this separate estimation approach can identify a linear MTE
model even with a single binary instrument. Although restrictive, the linear MTE model nests the standard IV estimator: The model gives the exact same estimate of LATE while at the same time providing a simple test
for its external validity and a linear extrapolation. Another key result is
that the alternative estimation approach allows identification of a flexible
MTE model under the additional assumption of additive separability between observed and unobserved heterogeneity in treatment effects.
We applied these identification results to empirically assess the interaction between the quantity and quality of children. Motivated by the seminal
quantity-quality model of fertility, a large and growing body of empirical research has used IV to examine the effect of family size on child outcomes.
We found that the effects of family size vary in magnitude and even sign,
and that families act as if they possess some knowledge of the idiosyncratic
effects. We also rejected the external validity of the LATEs of family size at
conventional significance levels. When comparing the MTE weights asso22

ciated with the IV estimates to the MTE weights associated with the ATE
and the ATT, we found that the latter treatment parameters assign much
more weight to positive MTEs. This explains why the ATE and the ATT of
family size are sizable and positive, while the LATEs are smaller and sometimes negative. Taken together, our findings point to the importance of
moving beyond LATE in situations with a discrete instrument.

Tests of Constant MTE
Subsection III.B provided a test of constant MTE, assuming that k1 and k0 are linear functions of p. Under assumption 1, testing the null hypothesis of constant
MTE versus the alternative hypothesis of nonconstant MTE is then equivalent to
testing the null hypothesis D0 5 D1 versus a two-sided alternative, where

for j 5 f0, 1g:

Panel A of figure B1 illustrates the testable prediction for (D0, D1) under the null
hypothesis of constant MTE. The dark (white) area gives the set of (D0, D1) that
are (not) consistent with the null hypothesis of constant MTE. To implement the
test, we regress Y on D, Z and their interaction and perform a two-sided t -test on
the interaction coefficient. In the first row of table B1, we report the results of
this test. We can reject the null hypothesis of constant MTE at the 1 percent significance level.
A limitation of this test is that it relies on k1 and k0 being specified as linear
functions of p. As usual, the test is not valid if the model is misspecified (i.e.,
k1 or k0 is not a linear function of p). Misspecification can lead us to falsely reject
the null hypothesis of constant MTE, and it can make us fail to correctly reject
the null hypothesis of constant MTE.
We now consider two ways in which to relax the parametric assumption on k0
and k1. We first provide a test in which k1 and k0 are specified as monotonic quadratic functions of p. Next, we consider a test in which all we assume is that k1 and
k0 are monotonic functions of p. In both cases, the null hypothesis of constant
MTE provides testable restrictions against the alternative of nonconstant MTE.
However, weaker parametric assumptions on k0 and k1 provide weaker testable
restrictions on (D0, D1). Therefore, the choice of test involves a trade-off between
power and sensitivity to the specification of k0 and k1.23

The parametric assumption about k1 and k0 (linear, quadratic, or monotonic in p) does
not in itself restrict the possible values of (D0, D1). To see this, consider the case in which k1
and k0 are linear functions of p with slope coefficients a1 and a0, respectively. Without further
assumptions, (D0, D1) can take any values because there are no constraints on the difference
between a1 and a0. This means that the specified structure on k1 and k0 does not, in itself, impose testable restrictions on (D0, D1). However, under the null hypothesis of constant MTE,

MTE, monotonicity of K1 and K 0 implies that D1 and D0 should have the same sign.
If k1 and k0 are specified as monotonic functions of p, we can reject the null hypothesis of constant MTE if D1 and D0 have different signs.
Panel C of figure B1 illustrates the testable predictions for (D0, D1) under the
null hypothesis of constant MTE. The dark (white) area gives the set of (D0, D1)
that are (not) consistent with the null hypothesis of constant MTE. As expected,
assuming monotonic k1 and k0 (instead of quadratic and monotonic) gives weaker
testable restrictions on (D0, D1) from the null hypothesis of constant MTE.
Implementation of Tests
In the test with monotonic k1 and k0, the null hypothesis of constant MTE implies
that (D0, D1) is an element in a subset of R2 that is the union of two convex subsets
(see panel C of fig. B1). We proceed by first providing p-values for the tests of
whether (D0, D1) is an element in each of the convex subsets. Finally, we construct
a p -value for the joint test of the null hypothesis that (D0, D1) is an element in the
union of the two convex subsets versus a complementary alternative hypothesis,
by using the intersection-union method of Berger (1982).
Specifically, our procedure consists of three steps. First, we test the null hypothesis that (D0, D1) is an element in the lower-left quadrant of panel C of figure B1
versus a complementary alternative. This is a joint test of two inequality constraints. We produce a p-value for this test by testing each inequality constraint separately with one-sided t-tests and applying a Bonferroni correction to the result.
The Bonferroni-corrected p-value for the test of the null hypothesis that both inequality constraints are satisfied versus a complementary alternative is two times
the smallest of the p-values from the two t-tests. Second, we use the same procedure
to compute a p -value for the test of the null hypothesis that (D0, D1) is an element
in the upper-right quadrant of panel C of figure B1. Finally, we apply the intersectionunion method to construct a p -value for the joint test of the null hypothesis that
(D0, D1) is an element in the union of the two convex subsets versus the complementary alternative. Berger (1982) shows that the p -value for this joint test is the
lower of the two p -values from the first two steps.24
The main advantages of this testing procedure are that it is simple to implement and that it also applies to dependent tests. We can therefore apply it directly
to test for constant MTE when k1 and k0 are quadratic and monotonic. The main
drawback of the procedure is that it is not efficient because of the conservative
nature of Bonferroni corrections, so the reported p-values should be interpreted
as upper bounds.
In the second row of table B1, we report the p -value of the test for constant MTE
(against the alternative hypothesis of nonconstant MTE), assuming that k0 and k1
are quadratic and monotonic functions of p. Our findings suggest that we can re24
Let p1 and p 2 be p -values associated with each of these two tests. Under the null hypothesis, at least one of these p -values (the one associated with the set containing the true parameter values) will have a distribution that dominates a uniform distribution, such that Prðpi <
qÞ ≤ q. The intersection-union method suggests using max(p1, p2) as the p -value of the full
test. This is a valid p -value because Prðmaxðp1 , p2 Þ < qÞ ≤ Prðpi < qÞ for both i 5 1 and i 5 2,
and since one of these is bounded above by q, we have Prðmaxðp1 , p2 Þ < qÞ ≤ q.

ject the null hypothesis of constant MTE at the 1 percent significance level given
this specification of k0 and k1. In the third row of table B1, we report the p-value of
the test for constant MTE (against the alternative hypothesis of nonconstant
MTE), assuming that k0 and k1 are monotonic functions of p. Our findings suggest
that we cannot reject the null hypothesis of constant MTE at conventional significance levels with such a flexible model specification.

Our interest is centered on how the analysis is affected by the empirical specification of kj(p) being an approximation as opposed to being exactly correct.25
In particular, suppose that the true models of kj(p) are polynomials in FU21 ðpÞ of
order M2 > M1 . In this case, the OLS estimates of the l1’s and l0’s suffer from
omitted variable bias. Let dji be a vector of the probability limits of the slope coefficients in the regression of xji on ½xj0 , :::, xjM  for i 5 M1 1 1, :::, M2 and j 5 0, 1.

Appendix D
Heterogeneity in the Effects of Family Size
This appendix describes the pattern of heterogeneity in the relationship between
the quantity and quality of children that is consistent with the generalized Roy
model.
Consider first the traditional approach to estimating the model of equations (2)
and (3), which assumes that (U0, U1, UD) are joint normal distributed and independent of Z (see, e.g., Björklund and Moffitt 1987). Although this normal selection
model restricts the shape of the MTE model, it is consistent with IV estimates of
different magnitude and sign depending on the choice of instrument: the MTE
is either constant, monotonically declining (i.e., positive selection on gains), or
monotonically increasing (i.e., negative selection on gains) in UD; the MTE tends
toward ±∞ as UD tends toward zero or one (unless the MTE is constant); the distribution of MTE is symmetric in UD, so that the slope of the MTE takes the same absolute value for UD 5 u and UD 5 1 2 u.
Although the joint normality assumption is convenient, it can mask heterogeneity in the effects of family size if the population is segmented by preferences or
constraints. For example, preference for mixed-sex sibships is unlikely to be manifested with equal force by all groups in the population. Mixture distributions
arise naturally when the population contains two or more distinct subpopulations. In figure D1, we present a simple example of MTE in a mixture model with
two subpopulations of equal size. Specifically, let the unobserved component UD
of parents’ net gain from having three or more children be generated from a mixture of two random variables UD1 and UD2 with equal probability. We assume that
UD1 is standard normal, while UD2 is normal with mean zero and variance two. Individuals in the first subgroup have a constant MTE of one, while individuals in
the second subgroup have a constant MTE of negative one. Although each subgroup has a constant MTE, figure D1 shows that the population distribution of
MTE derived from this mixed model has a U shape. Individuals from the subgroup with high MTE are overrepresented in the tails, whereas individuals from
the subgroup with a low MTE tend to be in the middle ranges of UD. The reason is

F IG . D1.—Example of MTE generated from a mixture model. This figure displays the
population distribution of MTE, which is generated from a mixture of two normal selection
models. The population consists of two equally sized subgroups: one with constant MTEs
equal to one and the other with constant MTEs equal to negative one. In the selection equation, both groups enter treatment if a random variable exceeds a threshold of zero. The
group with negative MTEs has random variables that are standard normal, while the group
with positive MTEs has random variables that are normal with mean zero and variance two.
The y-axis measures the value of the MTE in the population (i.e., the weighted average of
the MTEs in the two subgroups), whereas the x-axis represents the unobserved component
of parents’ net gain from treatment. A high value of p means that treatment is less likely.

that the first subgroup has a relatively high variance of UD: This could, for example, be due to weaker preferences for mixed-sex sibship such that the unobserved
component explains more of the variation in the choice of family size.
Finally, we note that several sources can generate MTE of different magnitude
and sign, including heterogeneity in preferences over child quality and quantity,
differences in the technologies available to produce child quality, and variability
in the economic resources available to families. For example, the quantity-quality
model of fertility by Becker and Lewis (1973) is consistent with both positive and
negative effects of family size depending on whether quantity and quality are
complements or substitutes (Rosenzweig and Wolpin 1980; Mogstad and Wiswall
2016). Also other theories, outside the Becker and Lewis model, suggest heterogeneity in the effects of family size on child outcome. In particular, for some families, additional siblings may benefit existing children if they stabilize the parental relationship (see, e.g., Becker 1998), if they make maternal employment less

likely (see, e.g., Ruhm 2008), or if there are positive spillover effects among siblings (see, e.g., Bandura 1977).
Appendix E
Bounds for ATE and ATT
This appendix presents nonparametric bounds on the ATE and the ATT of family size. We first construct worst-case bounds (see Manski 1989), exploiting that
the dependent variable is bounded. In an attempt to tighten these bounds, we impose the standard IV assumptions of exclusion, monotonicity, and relevance.26
Worst-Case Bounds
The ATE can be written as
E ðY1 2 Y0 Þ 5 E ðY1 2 Y0 jD 5 1Þ PrðD 5 1Þ 1 E ðY1 2 Y0 jD 5 0Þ PrðD 5 0Þ
5 ½E ðY1 jD 5 1Þ 2 E ðY0 jD 5 1Þ PrðD 5 1Þ
1 ½E ðY1 jD 5 0Þ 2 E ðY0 jD 5 0Þ½1 2 PrðD 5 1Þ,
while the ATT is defined as
E ðY1 2 Y0 jD 5 1Þ 5 E ðY1 jD 5 1Þ 2 E ðY0 jD 5 1Þ:
In data, we observe the empirical analogue of PrðD 5 1Þ, EðY1 jD 5 1Þ, and
EðY0 jD 5 0Þ, whereas EðY0 jD 5 1Þ and EðY1 jD 5 0Þ are unobserved. However,
the dependent variable—years of schooling—is bounded between 6 and 21. This
gives us the inequalities 6 ≤ EðY0 jD 5 1Þ ≤ 21 and 6 ≤ EðY1 jD 5 0Þ ≤ 21, allowing us to construct worst-case bounds. For the ATE, we obtain a lower bound by
setting EðY0 jD 5 1Þ 5 21 and EðY1 jD 5 0Þ 5 6, whereas an upper bound is constructed by setting EðY0 jD 5 1Þ 5 6 and EðY1 jD 5 0Þ 5 21. For the ATT, we construct a lower bound by setting EðY0 jD 5 1Þ 5 21 and an upper bound by setting
EðY0 jD 5 1Þ 5 6. The worst-case bounds are reported in the first row of table E1.
They are not informative about the effects of family size. For example, the worstcase bounds on the ATE tell us that the effect of another sibling is somewhere
between 27.7 and 7.3 years of schooling.
Bounds Based on Instrumental Variables
In an attempt to tighten the bounds, we impose the standard IV assumptions of
exclusion, monotonicity, and relevance. Under these assumptions, we can use the
sharp bounds provided in Heckman and Vytlacil (2001). Rows 2 and 3 of table E1

26
Alternatively, one could invoke the monotone IV assumption (Manski and Pepper
2000). This assumption is a weakened form of the exclusion restriction. As a result, it will
necessarily produce wider bounds than the standard IV assumptions. Indeed, the monotone IV assumption does little to tighten the worst-case bounds in our setting.
