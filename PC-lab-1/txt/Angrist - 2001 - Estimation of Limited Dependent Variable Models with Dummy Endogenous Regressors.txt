Estimation of Limited Dependent Variable

Models With Dummy Endogenous
Regressors: Simple Strategies
for Empirical Practice

Applied economists have long struggled with the question of how to accommodate binary endogenous
regressors in models with binary and nonnegative outcomes. I argue here that much of the difficulty with

limited dependent variables comes from a focus on structural parameters, such as index coefficients,
instead of causal effects. Once the object of estimation is taken to be the causal effect of treatment,
several simple strategies are available. These include conventional two-stage least squares, multiplicative
models for conditional means, linear approximation of nonlinear causal models, models for distribution
effects, and quantile regression with an endogenous binary regressor. The estimation strategies discussed
in the article are illustrated by using multiple births to estimate the effect of childbearing on employment
status and hours of work.

from the causal agenda. For example, Keane and Wolpin
(1997, p. 111) used structural models to "forecast the behavior
of agents given any change in the state of the world that can

be characterized as a change in their constraints." A prerequisite for this is credible assessment of causal effects of past
changes. Structural parameters that are not linked to causal

Average treatment effects were calculated with the aid of

scaling factor as nonrandom. This follows the convention for
reporting marginal effects in programs like Stata; in practice,
E[Y, - Y0oY, > 0, D = 1] = E[Y, - Y0oY, > 0]

follows:

E[YjiXi, Di = 0] d dE[YijXi, Di]/lD = d([X3? + aDo] i a.

Average effects on the treated can therefore be approximated
