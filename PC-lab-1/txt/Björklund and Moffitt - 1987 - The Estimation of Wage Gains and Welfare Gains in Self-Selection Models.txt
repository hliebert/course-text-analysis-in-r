THE ESTIMATION OF WAGE GAINS AND WELFARE
GAINS IN SELF-SELECTION MODELS
Anders BjZorklund and Robert Moffitt*
Abstract-We modify the basic self-selection model for the

effects of education, training, unions, and other activities on
wages, by including "heterogeneity of rewards" to the activity

variable (for union status, educational level, and
so on) in the wage equation; we assume instead

-i.e., differences across individuals in the rate of return to the

that the coefficient has an unobserved random

activity. We show that such heterogeneity creates a new form

component. This specification reflects more accu-

of selection bias. We provide tests for its presence and we draw

out its implications for the wage and welfare gains to the
activity. An empirical application provides strong support for
such heterogeneity in one particular training program.

NE of the largest literatures in empirical

O labor economics concems the estimation of
the determinants of the effects of various individual choices on wages. For example, the effects on

wages of education, unions, migration, and
manpower training have been heavily studied.

Nowadays the potential self-selection bias that
arises from ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation of such relationships is widely recognized, a
bias that arises if those participating in the activity

are systematically different from those who are
not participating. Since the development of selec-

tivity-bias methods by Maddala and Lee (1976),
Heckman (1978, 1979), Lee (1979), and Barnow et

al. (1980), a fairly standardized methodology has
been available for the elimination of this bias.
Examples of applications of these techniques are

Willis and Rosen (1979) and Kenny et al. (1979)
for education, Lee (1978) for unions, Nakosteen
and Zimmer (1980) for migration, and Mallar

et al. (1980) for manpower training.
In this paper we show the implications of mod-

ifying the standard self-selection model to allow

for what we call "heterogeneity of rewards." The
standard model assumes implicitly that there is a
constant coefficient on the participation dummy

rately the language commonly used to describe

selection bias, an example of which is the hypothesis that "those individuals participating in an activity are those who get more out of it." We assert

that the standard model is not consistent with this
language.

The implications of heterogeneity in rewardsor heterogeneity in the rate of return-are many
and interesting. First, we are able to estimate not

only the average wage gain to the activity of those
who are currently participating, but also the
marginal wage gain of the individuals who are on

the margin. The two may be quite different, and it
is the latter that is important if one is attempting

to expand the activity and draw more people into
it. Second, we show that the selection equation

should be specified formally as the difference between benefits and costs to participation. We draw
an analogy with consumer demand theory to show
that, as a result, we can distinguish the wage gain
from the welfare gain to the activity. The two are

different if costs are nonzero. To estimate the
welfare gain, one must estimate a structural form

of the selection equation; estimating an ad-hoc
selection equation together with the wage equation
is not enough.
In the next section we present our model. Following that we present an application to a data set

of manpower trainees. Our empirical results indicate rather dramatically that heterogeneity of rewards is present.

This is our restriction from theory-that the participation

should be noted that an equivalent model would result if the
wage gain were allowed to have a non-unitary coefficient, for in

that case the variance of the error term could not be identified.
In the probit model the coefficients can only be identified up to
a factor of proportionality, and in our case we normalize by

setting the variance of the error term to one.

What would be the effect of expanding this
program on mean wages (i.e., on productivity
growth) in Sweden? Evaluating equation (17) at

the means indicates that mean wages would fall if
the program were expanded by lowering costs
(e.g., raising stipends). This is because, at the
margin, those who would be brought into the
program have negative wage gains according to

our estimates. This is illustrated in figure 1, which

III. Summary and Conclusions

In this paper we have extended the basic selfselection model-appropriate for estimating the
effect on earnings of education, training, unions,

or migration-to incorporate heterogeneity of rewards in returns to the activity. We show that
such heterogeneity can be neatly specified in a
model that has a close relationship to basic consumer demand theory and that the welfare gain to
the activity can also be estimated in the model.

We also demonstrate that the notion of hetero-

geneity of rewards has implications for public
policy, for it implies that bringing more people
into the activity lowers the mean rate of return.
One of the strengths of our model is that it makes

these points explicit and provides the means to
calculate directly the effect of changing the cost
structure on participation probabilities and mean
rewards of participants. Our empirical application

to a Swedish manpower training program provides
strong evidence of the existence of heterogeneity
of rewards.
