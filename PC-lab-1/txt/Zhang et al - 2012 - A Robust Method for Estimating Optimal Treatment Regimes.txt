Summary. A treatment regime is a rule that assigns a treatment, among a set of possible treatments, to a patient

a function of his/her observed characteristics, hence "personalizing" treatment to the patient. The goal is to identify th
optimal treatment regime that, if followed by the entire population of patients, would lead to the best outcome on averag
Given data from a clinical trial or observational study, for a single treatment decision, the optimal regime can be found b

covariates, the optimal treatment is the one that yields the most favorable expected outcome. However, treatment assignm
