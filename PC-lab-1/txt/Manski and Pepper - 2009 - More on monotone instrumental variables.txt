Summary Econometric analyses of treatment response often use instrumental variable (IV)
assumptions to identify treatment effects. The traditional IV assumption holds that mean
response is constant across the sub-populations of persons with different values of an observed
covariate. Manski and Pepper (2000) introduced monotone instrumental variable assumptions,
which replace equalities with weak inequalities. This paper presents further analysis of the
monotone instrumental variable (MIV) idea. We use an explicit response model to enhance
the understanding of the content of MIV and traditional IV assumptions. We study the
identifying power of MIV assumptions when combined with the homogeneous linear response
assumption maintained in many studies of treatment response. We also consider estimation of
MIV bounds, with particular attention to finite-sample bias.

1. INTRODUCTION
Econometric analyses of treatment response often use instrumental variable (IV) assumptions to
identify treatment effects. The traditional IV assumption holds that mean response is constant
across the sub-populations of persons with different values of an observed covariate. The
credibility of this assumption is often a matter of considerable disagreement, as evidenced by
frequent debates about whether some covariate is a ‘valid instrument’. There is therefore good
reason to consider weaker but more credible assumptions.
To this end, Manski and Pepper (2000) introduced monotone instrumental variable (MIV)
assumptions. An MIV assumption weakens the traditional IV assumption by replacing its
equality of mean response across sub-populations with a weak inequality. We studied the
identifying power of MIV assumptions when imposed alone and when combined with the
assumption of monotone treatment response (MTR). We reported an empirical application using
MIV and MTR assumptions to bound the wage returns to schooling.
This paper presents further analysis of the MIV idea. We draw in part on previously
unpublished research that appeared in our original working paper on MIVs (Manski and Pepper,
1998), but that was not included in our 2000 Econometrica article. We also discuss statistical
issues associated with estimation of MIV bounds.

As prelude, Section 2 sets up basic concepts and notation, summarizes the main analytical
findings of Manski and Pepper (2000) and describes subsequent findings. Section 3 uses an
explicit response model to enhance the understanding of the content of MIV and traditional
IV assumptions. The key is to integrate the concepts of treatments and covariates in the analysis
of treatment response. We use the integrated framework to suggest MIV assumptions that might
credibly be applied in the analyses of the returns to schooling and other studies of production.
Section 3 is a revised version of Manski and Pepper (1998, Section 2).
Section 4 studies the identifying power of MIV assumptions when combined with the
homogeneous linear response (HLR) assumption maintained in many studies of treatment
response. We think that the HLR assumption is rarely credible; hence, we do not endorse its
use in practice. However, widespread application of the assumption makes it important that
researchers understand its implications. It has been common to combine the HLR assumption
with a traditional IV assumption to achieve point-identification of treatment effects. We show that
combining the HLR assumption with an MIV assumption yields a bound on treatment effects.
Section 4 is a revised and extended version of Manski and Pepper (1998, Section 4).
Section 5 considers estimation of the bounds reported in Sections 2 and 4. An important
statistical concern, noted but not analysed in Manski and Pepper (2000), is that analogue
estimates of the bounds have finite-sample bias that make them tend to be narrower than the
true bounds. We explain this bias, give Monte Carlo evidence on its magnitude and describe the
bias-correction procedure of Kreider and Pepper (2007). We also show how the so-called weakinstruments problem that arises in analogue estimation under HLR and IV assumptions manifests
itself when HLR and MIV assumptions are combined.

2. BACKGROUND
2.1. Concepts and notation
We use the same formal setup as Manski and Pepper (2000). There is a probability space (J,
, P) of individuals. Each member j of population J has observable covariates xj ∈ X and a
response function yj (·):T →Y mapping the mutually exclusive and exhaustive treatments t ∈ T
into real-valued outcomes yj (t) ∈ Y . The outcome space Y has greatest lower bound K 0 ≡ inf Y
and least upper bound K 1 ≡ sup Y .
Person j has a realized treatment zj ∈ T and a realized outcome yj ≡ yj (zj ), both of which
are observable. The latent outcomes yj (t), t = zj are not observable. An empirical researcher
learns the distribution P(x, z, y) of covariates, realized treatments and realized outcomes by
observing a random sample of the population. The researcher’s problem is to combine this
empirical evidence with assumptions in order to learn about the distribution P [y(·)] of response
functions, or perhaps the conditional distributions P [y(·)|x].
With this background, we may define an MIV assumption. Let x = (w, v) and X = W ×
V. Each value of (w, v) defines an observable sub-population of persons. The familiar meanindependence form of IV assumption is that, for each t ∈ T and each w ∈ W , the mean value of
y(t) is the same in all of the sub-populations (w, v = u), u ∈ V .
IV A SSUMPTION. Covariate v is an instrumental variable in the sense of mean-independence
if, for each t ∈ T , each w ∈ W and all (u1 , u2 ) ∈ V × V ,
E[y(t)|w, v = u2 ] = E[y(t)|w, v = u1 ].

MIV assumptions replace the equality in (2.1) by an inequality, yielding a mean-monotonicity
condition
MIV A SSUMPTION. Let V be an ordered set. Covariate v is a monotone IV in the sense of
mean-monotonicity if, for each t ∈ T , each w ∈ W and all (u1 , u2 ) ∈ V × V such that u2 ≥ u1 ,
E[y(t)|w, v = u2 ] ≥ E[y(t)|w, v = u1 ].

(2.2)

Certainly, the most commonly applied IV assumption is exogenous treatment selection (ETS).
Here, the IV v is the realized treatment z. Hence, assumption (2.1) becomes the following.
ETS A SSUMPTION. For each t ∈ T , each w ∈ W and all (u1 , u2 ) ∈ T × T ,
E[y(t)|w, z = u2 ] = E[y(t)|w, z = u1 ].

(2.3)

Weakening equation (2.3) to an inequality yields the special MIV assumption that we call
monotone treatment selection (MTS).
MTS A SSUMPTION. Let T be an ordered set. For each t ∈ T , each w ∈ W and all (u1 , u2 ) ∈
T × T such that u2 ≥ u1 ,
u2 ≥ u1 ⇒ E[y(t)|w, z = u2 ] ≥ E[y(t)|w, z = u1 ].

(2.4)

The MTS assumption should not be confused with the MTR assumption of Manski (1997). This
is the following.
MTR A SSUMPTION. Let T be an ordered set. For each j ∈J ,
t2 ≥ t1 ⇒ yj (t2 ) ≥ yj (t1 ).

(2.5)

2.2. Findings
This section summarizes the main analytical findings of Manski and Pepper (2000). To simplify
the exposition, we henceforth leave implicit the conditioning on w maintained in the definitions
of MIVs.
2.2.1. MIV assumptions. Consider an MIV assumption alone, not combined with other
assumptions. Proposition 2.1 gives sharp bounds on the conditional mean responses E[y(t)|v
= u], u ∈V and the marginal mean E[y(t)]. These bounds are informative if the outcome space
Y has finite range [K 0 , K 1 ]. The MIV bounds have particularly simple forms in the case of
monotone treatment selection.
P ROPOSITION 2.1. Let the MIV assumption (2.2) hold. Then for each u ∈V ,
sup E(y|v = u1 , z = t) · P (z = t|v = u1 ) + K0 · P (z = t|v = u1 )

It follows that

Let the MTS assumption (2.4) hold. Then bound (2.6) reduces to
u < t ⇒ K0 ≤ E[y(t)|z = u] ≤ E(y|z = t)
u = t ⇒ E[y(t)|z = u] = E(y|z = t)
u > t ⇒ E(y|z = t) ≤ E[y(t)|z = u] ≤ K1 .

(2.8)

It follows that
K0 · P (z < t) + E(y|z = t) · P (z ≥ t) ≤ E[y(t)] ≤ K1 · P (z > t) + E(y|z = t) · P (z ≤ t).
(2.9)
In the absence of other information, these bounds are sharp.
The basic finding in Proposition 2.1 is inequality (2.6), from which the other findings
are derived. The lower bound in (2.6) is the supremum of the no-assumptions bounds on
E[y(t)|v = u 1 ] over all u1 ≤ u. The upper bound is the infimum of the no-assumptions bounds
on E[y(t)|v = u 2 ] over u2 ≥ u. Hence, the MIV bound on E[y(t)|v = u] is a subset of the
no-assumption bound on E[y(t)|v = u]. The MIV assumption has no identifying power if the
no-assumptions lower and upper bounds on E[y(t)|v = u] weakly increase with u. Otherwise, it
has identifying power in the formal sense that at least some MIV bounds are proper subsets of
the corresponding no-assumptions bounds.
Bound (2.6) is a superset of the Manski (1990) IV bound on E[y(t)|v = u], which is the
intersection of the no-assumptions bounds on E[y(t)|v = u 1 ] over all u1 ∈ V . The MIV and IV
bounds coincide if the no-assumptions bounds on E[y(t)|v = u] weakly decrease with u. In this
case, the MIV and IV assumptions have the same identifying power.
2.2.2. MIV and MTR assumptions. The MIV and MTR assumptions make distinct contributions
to identification. When imposed together, the two assumptions can have substantial identifying
power. Combining the MTR and MTS assumptions yields a particularly interesting finding.
Whereas the MIV-MTR bounds are informative only when Y has finite range, the MTS-MTR
bounds are informative even if Y is unbounded. Proposition 2.2 gives these results.
P ROPOSITION 2.2. Let the MIV and MTR assumptions (2.2) and (2.5) hold. Then for each u ∈ V ,
sup E(y|v = u1 , t ≥ z) · P (t ≥ z|v = u1 ) + K0 · P (t < z|v = u1 )

2.3. Subsequent findings
The analytical findings described above have been applied in several empirical studies of
treatment response. As mentioned earlier, we reported MIV bounds on the wage returns to
schooling. Subsequently, Gonzáles (2005) has studied the wage returns to English proficiency.
Gerfin and Schellhorn (2006) have studied the effect of deductibles in health care insurance on
doctor visits. Kreider and Hill (2008) have studied the effect of health insurance coverage on
health care utilization.
Manski and Pepper (2000) proposed MIVs specifically to weaken the traditional meanindependence IV assumption in the analysis of treatment response. However, our broad idea
was to enhance the credibility of empirical research by replacing traditional distributional
equality assumptions with weak inequalities. Other manifestations of this idea have developed
subsequently.
The findings of our 2000 article apply immediately to inference on the population mean
of an outcome from a random sample with missing outcome data. Let T = {0, 1}, with t =
1 indicating that the outcome is observable and t = 0 that it is unobservable. Let y j (1) be
the outcome of interest. Let z j = 1 if y j (1) is observable and z j = 0 otherwise. With these
definitions, Proposition 2.1 gives the sharp bound on E[y(1)] when a covariate v satisfies MIV
assumption (2.2). This application of the MIV idea is developed in Manski (2003, section 2.5),
with the notational simplification that y(1) here is called y there.
Blundell et al. (2007) apply the missing-outcome version of the MIV assumption to inference
on wages. The outcome of interest is wage, which is observable when a person works but not
otherwise. Blundell et al. perform inference when a traditional statistical-independence form

S205

of IV assumption is replaced by a weak stochastic dominance assumption. To accomplish this,
they apply Proposition 2.1 to the distribution function P [y(1) ≥ r] = E{1[y(t) ≥ r]}, all r ∈ R 1 .
This work partially addresses the Manski and Pepper (2000) call for research on MIVs that
replaces the statistical-independence assumption of classical randomized experiments with weak
stochastic dominance. Blundell et al. also contribute new analytical findings on identification of
quantiles and inter-quantile differences.
MIV assumptions may also be applied when a researcher faces a data problem other than
missing outcomes. Kreider and Pepper (2007, 2008) consider inference on a conditional mean
when the data problem is partial misreporting of either the conditioning variable or the outcome
variable. They maintain assumption (2.2) for a given covariate v and obtain a version of
Proposition 2.1 in which the lower (upper) bound in inequality (2.6) is replaced by the supremum
(infimum) of several v-specific lower (upper) bounds that hold in the misreporting context.
Yet another related line of work begins with traditional parametric econometric models in
which the parameters of interest solve a set of moment equations, and replaces these equations
with a set of weak moment inequalities. Although replacement of parametric moment equations
with inequalities is very much within the broad MIV theme, the approaches used to study
partial identification of parametric models are quite different from and more complex than the
transparent non-parametric analysis of Propositions 2.1 and 2.2 (see Manski and Tamer, 2002,
Chernozhukov, Hong, and Tamer, 2007 and Rosen, 2008).

3. WHAT ARE IV AND MIV ASSUMPTIONS?
The concepts introduced in Section 2 suffice to define IV and MIV assumptions and to analyse
their identifying power. Imbedding these concepts within a broader framework, however, helps
to understand the meaning of these assumptions. Section 3.1 sets out this broader framework.
Section 3.2 uses it to develop a lemma suggesting MIV assumptions that might credibly be
imposed when analysing the returns to schooling. Section 3.3 discusses other applications of the
lemma to production analysis.
3.1. Treatments and covariates
The discussion of Section 2 suggests a sharp distinction between treatments and covariates.
Treatments have been presented as quantities that may be manipulated autonomously, inducing
variation in response. We have been careful to use separate symbols for the conjectural treatments
t ∈ T and for the actual treatment z j realized by person j. Covariates have been presented only
as realized quantities associated with the members of the population, with no mention of their
manipulability. We have used v j to denote a covariate value associated with person j. We have
given no notation for conjectural values of covariates.
A symmetric perspective on treatments and covariates emerges if, as in Manski (1997,
Section 2.4), we enlarge the set of treatments from T to the Cartesian product set T × S and
introduce a generalized response function y∗j (·, ·) : T × S → Y mapping elements of T × S into
outcomes. Now, for each (t, s) ∈ T × S, yj∗ (t, s) is the outcome that person j would experience
if she were to receive the conjectural treatment pair (t, s). The treatment pair realized by person
j is (z j , ζ j ), and her realized outcome is yj = yj∗ (zj , ζj ), where ζj ∈ S is the realized value of
s. The response function yj (·) : T → Y introduced as a primitive in Section 2 is now a derived


sub-response function, obtained by evaluating y ∗j (·, ·) with its second argument set at the realized
treatment value ζ j . That is,
yj (·) ≡ yj∗ (·, ζj ).

(3.1)

In this broadened framework, covariate ζ j is the realized value of treatment s.
With this as background, observe that the familiar statement ‘variable v does not affect
response’ has two distinct formal interpretations. One interpretation is that v is an IV, as defined
in (2.1). The other is that outcomes are constant under conjectural variations in v. Under the latter
interpretation, S = V and
yj∗ (t, u) = yj∗ (t, vj ) = yj (t)

(3.2)

for all j ∈ J and (t, u) ∈ T × V . Assumption (3.2) has not yet been named. We call it a constant
treatment response (CTR) assumption.
Similarly, the familiar statement ‘response is monotone in v’ has two interpretations. One
is that v is an MIV, as defined in (2.2). The other is that outcomes vary monotonically under
conjectural variations in v. Under the latter interpretation, S = V and
u2 ≥ u1 ⇒ yj∗ (t, u2 ) ≥ yj∗ (t, u1 )

(3.3)

for all j ∈ J and t ∈ T . This is an MTR assumption.
Distinguishing appropriately between IV/MIV assumptions and CTR/MTR assumptions is
critical to the informed analysis of treatment response. We cannot know how often empirical
researchers, thinking loosely that ‘variable v does not affect response’, have imposed an IV
assumption but really had a CTR assumption in mind. Introducing MIV assumptions here, we
want to squelch from the start any confusion between MIV and MTR assumptions.
3.2. Researcher-measured ability and the returns to schooling
Labour economists studying the returns to schooling commonly suppose that each individual
j has a wage function y j (t), giving the wage that j would receive were she to obtain t years
of schooling. Observing realized covariates, schooling and wages in the population, labour
economists often seek to learn the mean wage E[y(t)] that would occur if a randomly drawn
member of the population were to receive t years of schooling. Researchers often use personal,
family and environmental attributes as IVs for years of schooling. Yet, the validity of whatever
IV assumption may be imposed seems inevitably to be questioned.
Some formal analysis using the concepts of Section 3.1 suggests that school grades, test
scores and other measures of ability or achievement that are commonly observed by researchers
are plausible MIVs for inference on the returns to schooling. For succinctness, we refer below to
measures of ability rather than to measures of ability or achievement.
L EMMA 3.1. Let person j’s earning function be
yj∗ (t, s) = g(t, s, εj ).

(3.4)

Here, t ∈ T is years of schooling and s ∈ S is an ordered measure of ability that is observable
by employers. The quantity ε j is person j’s realization of another variable that takes values
in a space E and that is observable by employers. Assume that, for each (t, ε) ∈ T × E, the


More on monotone instrumental variables

S207

sub-response function g(t, ·, ε) is weakly increasing on S. Thus, wage increases with employermeasured ability. Let v ∈ V be an ordered measure of ability that is observable by a researcher.
Let ζ be the realized value of employer-measured ability. Assume that P (ζ |v) is weakly
increasing in v in the sense that P (ζ |v = u2 ) weakly stochastically dominates P (ζ |v = u1 ) when
u2 ≥ u1 . Assume that ε is statistically independent of (ζ , v). Then v is an MIV.
The lemma does not require that employers or researchers measure ability accurately.
Nor does it require that employers and researchers observe the same measure of ability.
It only requires that (i) wage increases with employer-measured ability and (ii) researchermeasured ability be a weakly positive predictor of employer-measured ability, in the sense of
stochastic dominance. These are understandable and plausible assumptions. Indeed, we think the
assumption that P (ζ |v) weakly increases in v in the sense of stochastic dominance appropriately
formalizes what many empirical researchers have in mind when they state that some observed
variable v is a ‘proxy’ for an unobserved variable ζ .
Although researcher-measured ability provides a credible MIV for inference on the returns to
schooling, we found in our own application that this MIV has little identifying power. Analysing
data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth, Manski and Pepper (1998) reported noassumptions bounds on the returns to schooling as well as bounds that use a respondent’s score
on the Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT) as an MIV. We found that the no-assumptions
bounds computed for different AFQT scores are nearly monotone increasing with the score. As a
consequence, the MIV bounds were only slightly narrower than the no-assumptions bounds.
3.3. Other applications to production analysis
For concreteness, we used the returns to schooling to motivate Lemma 3.1. We observe here that
the Lemma has other applications to production analysis.
In abstraction, let equation (3.4) give the production function for agent j, which might be a
firm producing a commodity, a person investing in human capital or another entity. Let t and s
be two conjectural factors of production whose realized values (z j , ζ j ) are either chosen by the
agent or predetermined. Let ε j be a production shock of some kind. For example, in agricultural
production, g(t, s, ε) might be crop output per acre, which varies with seed input t, planting effort
s and weather quality ε following planting.
Suppose that, for each agent j, a researcher observes the realized output y j and input z j . The
researcher does not observe input ζ j or the shock ε j , but he does observe a ‘proxy’ v j for ζ j . For
example, in the agricultural setting, the researcher might observe crop output y j , seed input z j
and labour hours v j allocated to planting. However, he might not observe cultivation effort and
weather quality.
Suppose the researcher finds it credible to assume that P (ζ |v) weakly increases in v in the
sense of stochastic dominance and that ε is statistically independent of (ζ , v). For example, these
assumptions are credible in the agricultural setting described above. Then, Lemma 3.1 shows
that v is an MIV.

4. COMBINING MIV AND HLR ASSUMPTIONS
Classical econometric analysis of treatment response, as codified in the literature on linear
simultaneous equations (Hood and Koopmans, 1953), supposes that the outcome space Y is the


entire real line and combines an IV assumption of form (2.1) with the homogeneous-linearresponse assumption
yj (t) = βt + δj .

(4.1)

Here, treatments are real-valued, δ j is an unobserved covariate and β is a slope parameter
that takes the same value for all members of the population. The central finding is that
assumptions (2.1) and (4.1) point-identify the response parameter β, provided that z is not mean
independent of v. For example, numerous studies of the returns to schooling report estimates of
β, interpreted as the common return that all members of the population experience per year of
schooling.
Empirical researchers have long used the HLR assumption even though it is not grounded
in economic theory or other substantive reasoning. The literature has not provided compelling,
or even suggestive, arguments in support of the hypothesis that response varies linearly with
treatment and that all persons have the same response parameter. Manski (1997) and Manski and
Pepper (2000) argue that much of the research that has used the HLR assumption could more
plausibly use the MTR assumption. Consumer theory suggests that, ceteris paribus, the demand
for a product weakly decreases as a function of the product’s price. The theory of production
suggests that, ceteris paribus, the output of a product weakly increases as a function of each
input into the production process. Human capital theory suggests that, ceteris paribus, the wage
that a worker earns weakly increases as a function of years of schooling. In these and other
settings, MTR assumptions have a reasonably firm foundation.
The above notwithstanding, it is important that researchers who want to maintain the
HLR assumption should understand its implications when combined with other assumptions.
This section studies identification when an MIV assumption of form (2.2) is combined with
assumption (4.1).
4.1. The classical result
As background, we first give a proof of the classical result that originally appeared in Manski
(1995, p. 152), with further exposition in Manski (2007, Chapter 8). This proof is much simpler
than those offered in traditional treatments of linear simultaneous equations. Moreover, it extends
easily when we replace the IV assumption with an MIV assumption in the next section.
Let u1 ∈ V and u2 ∈ V be any two points on the support of the distribution of covariate v.
Given (4.1), assumption (2.1) states that
E(δ|v = u2 ) = E(δ|v = u1 ).

(4.2)

Given (4.1), δj = yj − βzj for each person j. Hence,
E(y − βz|v = u2 ) = E(y − βz|v = u1 ).

(4.3)

Solving (4.3) for β yields
β=

E(y|v = u2 ) − E(y|v = u1 )
,
E(z|v = u2 ) − E(z|v = u1 )

(4.4)

provided that the dominator is non-zero. The requirement that the denominator be non-zero is
called the rank condition in the classical literature.

S209

Each quantity on the right-hand side of (4.4) is point-identified. Hence, assumptions (2.1),
(4.1), and the rank condition point-identify β. If V contains multiple (u 1 , u 2 ) pairs that satisfy
the rank condition, then there exist correspondingly multiple versions of equation (4.4). The
parameter β must equal the right-hand side of all such equations. If the right-hand side of all
versions of (4.4) have the same value, β is said to be over-identified. If versions of (4.4) differ in
value, either the IV or the HLR assumption is incorrect.
Equation (4.4) takes a particularly simple form in the case of an ETS assumption. Let v = z.
Then E(z|v = u2 ) − E(z|v = u1 ) = u2 − u1 . Hence, the rank condition holds and (4.4) reduces
to
β = [E(y|z = u2 ) − E(y|z = u1 )]/(u2 − u1 ).

(4.5)

4.2. Weakening an IV to an MIV
Now replace IV assumption (2.1) with MIV assumption (2.2). Let V be an ordered set and let
u 2 > u 1 be any two points on the support of v. Given (4.1), assumption (2.2) states that
E(δ|v = u2 ) ≥ E(δ|v = u1 ).

(4.6)

Recall that δj = yj − βzj for each person j. Hence,
E(y − βz|v = u2 ) ≥ E(y − ßz|v = u1 ).

(4.7)

Solving for β yields the inequality
β≤

E(y|v = u2 ) − E(y|v = u1 )
E(z|v = u2 ) − E(z|v = u1 )

if E(z|v = u2 ) − E(z|v = u1 ) > 0,

(4.8a)

β≥

E(y|v = u2 ) − E(y|v = u1 )
E(z|v = u2 ) − E(z|v = u1 )

if E(z|v = u2 ) − E(z|v = u1 ) < 0.

(4.8b)

This proves
P ROPOSITION 4.1. Let MIV assumption (2.2) and HLR assumption (4.1) hold. Then, β lies in
the intersection of the inequalities (4.8) over (u1 , u2 ) ∈ V × V such that u 2 > u 1 . In the absence
of other information, this bound is sharp.
Proposition 4.1 yields an informative bound on β if and only if z is not mean independent
of v. Thus, the rank condition here is the same as when an IV assumption is combined with the
HLR assumption. It may turn out that no value of β satisfies all of the inequalities in (4.8). If so,
either assumption HLR or MIV is incorrect.
In general, the bound in Proposition 4.1 does not point-identify β. However, the sign of β
may be identified. Inspection of (4.8) shows that sgn(β) is identified as negative if there exists a
u 2 > u 1 such that E(y|v = u2 ) − E(y|v = u1 ) < 0 and E(z|v = u2 ) − E(z|v = u1 ) > 0. Sgn(β)
is identified as positive if there exists a u 2 > u 1 such that E(y|v = u2 ) − E(y|v = u1 ) < 0 and
E(z|v = u2 ) − E(z|v = u1 ) < 0. Sgn(β) is not identified if E(y|v = u2 ) − E(y|v = u1 ) ≥ 0 for
all u 2 > u 1 .
Inequalities (4.8) take a particularly simple form in the case of an MTS assumption. Let
v = z. Then E(z|v = u2 ) − E(z|v = u1 ) = u2 − u1 > 0, so only (4.8a) is applicable. These

upper bounds on β reduce to
β≤

inf

(u2 ,u1 ):u2 >u1

E(y|z = u2 ) − E(y|z = u1 )
.
u2 − u1

(4.9)

Thus, the MTS and HLR assumptions together imply an upper bound on β but no lower
bound.
4.3. Restricted outcome spaces
The above analysis has supposed that the outcome space Y is the entire real line. Empirical
researchers often apply the HLR assumption in settings where Y is a restricted part of the real line,
perhaps a discrete set or a bounded interval. In such cases, the structure of Y implies constraints
on β that must hold even in the absence of an IV or MIV assumption. These constraints,
which typically are ignored in empirical studies, generally have no substantive interpretation and
often have the non-sensical implication that β must equal zero. These difficulties are regularly
overlooked in practice, so we call attention to them here, in the hope that empirical researchers
will henceforth be more judicious in their applications of the HLR assumption.
The source of the constraints is the fact that the outcomes generated by the HLR assumption
must logically be elements of Y. That is, β must be such that βt + δj ∈ Y for all t ∈ T and j ∈ J .
Recall that δj = yj − βzj for each person j. Hence, β must satisfy the constraints
β(t − zj ) + yj ∈ Y, ∀ t ∈ T

and

j ∈ J.

(4.10)

These constraints are unnatural when the outcome space is discrete. If Y and T are both
discrete, at most a discrete set of β values can satisfy (4.9). If Y is discrete and T is a continuum,
the only parameter value that satisfies (4.9) is β = 0. Hence, the HLR assumption is not sensible
when the outcome space is discrete.
The constraints imply a set of inequalities on β when the outcome space is a bounded interval.
Let Y = [K 0 , K 1 ]. Then (4.10) is the set of inequalities
K0 ≤ β(t − zj ) + yj ≤ K1 , ∀ t ∈ T

and

j ∈ J.

(4.11)

Manipulation of (4.11) yields these inequalities on β:
(K0 − yj )/(t1 − zj ) ≤ β ≤ (K1 − yj )/(t1 − zj ), ∀ j ∈ J ,

(4.12a)

(K1 − yj )/(t0 − zj ) ≤ β ≤ (K0 − yj )/(t0 − zj ), ∀ j ∈ J ,

(4.12b)

where t0 ≡ inf T and t1 ≡ sup T . These inequalities generally lack substantive interpretation.
Indeed, the only value satisfying (4.12a) is β = 0 if the population contains a member j for
which (yj = K0 , zj < t1 ) and a member k for which (yk = K1 , zk < t1 ). Similarly, the only value
satisfying (4.12b) is β = 0 if the population contains a member j for which (yj = K0 , zj > t0 )
and a k for which (yk = K1 , zk > t0 ). Thus, the HLR assumption generally is not sensible when
Y is a bounded interval.

5. ESTIMATION OF THE BOUNDS
Although identification usually is the dominant inferential problem in the analysis of treatment
response, finite-sample statistical inference can be a serious concern as well. It is easy to show
that analogue estimates of the bounds in Propositions 2.1 through 4.1 are consistent. Each bound
is a continuous function of point-identified conditional means. When V is finite, these conditional
means are consistently estimated by the corresponding sample averages. When V is a continuum,
non-parametric regression methods may be used. The bounds under the MTS assumption in (2.9)
and (2.13) have simple explicit forms, and the sampling distributions of analogue estimates are
correspondingly simple. However, the sup and inf operations in inequalities (2.6) and (2.10)
significantly complicate the bounds under other MIV assumptions, rendering it difficult to
analyse the sampling behaviour of analogue estimates. Moreover, the methods for forming
asymptotically valid confidence sets for partially identified parameters developed by Horowitz
and Manski (2000), Imbens and Manski (2004), Chernozhukov et al. (2007), Beresteanu and
Molinari (2008), Rosen (2008) and others appear not to apply.
An important statistical concern, noted but not analysed in Manski and Pepper (2000),
is that analogue estimates of bounds (2.6) and (2.10) have finite-sample bias that make the
estimates tend to be narrower than the true bounds. Section 5.1 explains this bias, gives Monte
Carlo evidence on its magnitude and describes a heuristically motivated bias-correction method.
Section 5.2 considers analogue estimation of the bound of Proposition 4.1. Although the present
discussion focuses on the estimation of MIV bounds, with obvious modifications it applies as
well to estimation of the IV bounds of Manski (1990).
5.1. Estimation of the bounds of Propositions 2.1 and 2.2
The finite-sample bias of analogue estimates is most transparent when V is a finite set. We restrict
attention to this case and focus on the lower bound in (2.6). Analysis of the upper bound in (2.6)
and the bounds in (2.10) is analogous.
To begin, observe that the lower bound in (2.6) may be rewritten as
max E{y · 1[z = t] + K0 · 1[z = t]|v = u1 }.
u1 ≤u

(5.1)

Let a random sample of size N be drawn. Let N(u) be the sub-sample size with (v = u). Consider
inference conditional on the vector N (V ) ≡ [N (u), u ∈ V ] of sub-sample sizes. The analogue
estimate of (5.1) is
max EN(V ) {y · 1[z = t] + K0 · 1[z = t]|v = u1 },
u1 ≤u

(5.2)

where E N (V) denotes the empirical mean. Suppose that all components of N(V) are positive, so
the estimate exists. Each term in (5.2) is an unbiased estimate of the corresponding term in (5.1).
It follows by Jensen’s inequality that


E ∗ max EN(V ) {y · 1[z = t] + K0 · 1[z = t]|v = u1 }
u1 ≤u


≥ max E y · 1[z = t] + K0 · 1[z = t]|v = u1 ,

where E∗ denotes the expected value of the estimate across repeated samples of sizes N(V).
The inequality in (5.3) is strict in the ordinary case where the distributions P {y · 1[z = t] + K0 ·
1[z = t]|v = u1 }, u1 ≤ u are non-degenerate and have overlapping supports.
The above shows that the analogue estimate of the lower bound is biased upwards for each
vector N(V) such that the estimate exists. Similar analysis shows that the estimate of the upper
bound is biased downwards. Thus, the mean estimate of the bound always is a subset of the true
bound and ordinarily is a proper subset.
5.1.1. Monte Carlo evidence. To obtain a sense of the magnitude of the bias, we have performed
a Monte Carlo experiment. Ceteris paribus, the bias is most serious when the no-assumption
bound is the same for all values of v, implying that the MIV assumption has no identifying
power. We consider such a setting. In particular,
a) v has a multinomial distribution with M equal-probability mass points {1/M, 2/M, . . . . ,
1}.
b) T = {0, 1}, zj = 1[vj + εj > 0], and ε is distributed N(0, 1).
c) yj = min{max[−1.96, ηj ], 1.96}, and η is distributed N(0, σ 2 ). Thus, y is censored
normal.
d) The random variables η, v and ε are mutually statistically independent.
In this setting,
E{y · 1[z = t] + K0 · 1[z = t]|v = u1 } = −1.96 · P (z = t|v = u1 ).

(5.4)

Let t = 1 and u = 1. Then (5.1) reduces to
−1.96 · min P (z = 0|v = u1 ) = −1.96 · P (z = 0|v = 1) ∼
= −0.31
u1 ≤1

(5.5)

for all values of M and σ 2 .
Fix values of N, M and σ 2 . To measure the bias of the analogue estimate, we draw 1000
random samples of size N from the distribution of {η, v, ε}, and compute the analogue estimate
of the MIV lower bound for each sample. The bias is then measured as the difference between
the average of the 1000 estimates and the true lower bound –0.31.
Table 1 displays the bias for N ∈ {100, 500, 1000), M ∈ {4, 8}, and σ 2 ∈ {1, 4, 25).
Qualitatively, the upwards bias increases with M and σ 2 and decreases with N. These findings
are sensible. The difference between the left- and right-hand sides of (5.3) increases with the
dispersion of the estimates. Dispersion increases with σ 2 and M, while it decreases with N.
Observe that the mean number of observations of y per value of v is N/M. Hence, for each value

of v, the sample size for estimation of E{y · 1[z = t] + K0 · 1[z = t]|v} tends to increase with N
and decrease with M.
Quantitatively, the bias is enormous when (N = 100, M = 8) for all values of σ 2 . Indeed, the
mean estimate of the bound is an empty interval when σ 2 ∈ {4, 25}. The bias is negligible when
(N = 1000, M = 4) for all values of σ 2 . Small to moderate biases occur at other values of (N, M,
σ 2 ).
5.1.2. Bias-corrected estimates. To counter the bias of the analogue estimate, it is natural to
seek bias-corrected methods. Kreider and Pepper (2007) proposed a bootstrap bias-corrected
estimator and applied it to their misreporting problem. The idea is to estimate the bias using the
bootstrap distribution, and then adjust the analogue estimate accordingly. For a random sample
of size N, let T N be the analogue estimate of the lower bound in (5.2) and let Eb (T N ) be the mean
of this estimate using the bootstrap distribution. The bias is then estimated to equal Eb (T N )T N , and the proposed bias-corrected estimator is 2T N -Eb (T N ). Analysing a partial identification
problem that is substantively different but has similar mathematical structure, Haile and Tamer
(2003) used a smoothing function to reduce the variability of analogue estimators across different
values of an index. While both correction methods seem reasonable and tractable, neither has a
firm theoretical foundation as of now.
Evidence on the efficacy of these corrections in finite samples can be obtained from
Monte Carlo experiments. We have assessed the Kreider and Pepper (2007) estimator using the
simulation design described earlier. To do this, we conducted further simulations to assess the
bootstrap distribution. For each of the 1000 random samples of size N, we drew 1000 random
pseudo-samples of size N, and used these pseudo-samples to compute the mean Eb (T N )of the
bootstrap distribution. The bias of the Kreider–Pepper estimator was then measured as the
difference between the average of the 1000 estimates and the true lower bound –0.31.
Table 2 displays the bias of the proposed estimator. Relative to the analogue estimator in (5.2),
substantial reductions in bias are realized in cases where N = 100 or M = 8. For example, when
(N = 100, M = 4, σ 2 = 25), the bias falls from 0.19 to 0.05. Overall, the biases are negligible
(less than or equal to 0.05) except in the extreme case when (N = 100, M = 8). The biases
are moderate in this case, but considerably smaller than the analogous biases of the analogue
estimator.
5.2. Estimation of the bound of Proposition 4.1
This final section considers estimation of the bound (4.8) obtained by combining an MIV
assumption with the HLR assumption. We first examine the special case in which the MIV is

the realized treatment. Here, inequality (4.9) gave the resulting sharp upper bound on β. The
argument of Section 5.1 shows that the analogue estimate of this bound is downward biased.
As earlier, consider inference conditional on N(V). The analogue estimate of (4.9) is
min

(u2 ,u1 ):u2 >u1

EN(V ) (y|z = u2 ) − EN(V ) (y|z = u1 )
u2 − u1 .

(5.6)

Let all components of N(V) be positive, so the estimate exists. Each term in (5.6) is an unbiased
estimate of the corresponding term in (4.9). It follows by Jensen’s inequality that


EN(V ) (y|z = u2 ) − EN(V ) (y|z = u1 )
E(y|z = u2 ) − E(y|z = u1 )

(5.7)
Thus, the estimate of the upper bound is biased downward for each vector N(V) such that the
estimate exists. Hence, the estimate is biased downward conditional on existence.
Now consider the general form of Proposition 4.1, where β lies in the intersection of the
inequalities (4.8). The analogue estimate of the upper bound is
min

u2 , u1 ∈ WU

EN(V ) (y|v = u2 ) − EN(V ) (y|v = u1 )
EN(V ) (z|v = u2 ) − EN(V ) (z|v = u1 )

(5.8a)

where WU ≡ {(u2 , u1 ) : u2 > u1 and EN(V ) (z|v = u2 ) − EN(V ) (z|v = u1 ) > 0}. Similarly, the
estimate of the lower bound is
max

(u2 ,u1 )∈WL

EN(V ) (y|v = u2 ) − EN(V ) (y|v = u1 )
,
EN(V ) (z|v = u2 ) − EN(V ) (z|v = u1 )

(5.8b)

where WL ≡ {(u2 , u1 ) : u2 > u1 and EN(V ) (z|v = u2 ) − EN(V ) (z|v = u1 ) < 0}.
The structure of this estimate is complex. In particular, the estimate is highly sensitive to
small variations in EN(V ) (z|v = u2 ) − EN(V ) (z|v = u1 ) when this quantity is near zero, with
discontinuity at zero. Realizations of EN(V ) (z|v = u2 ) − EN(V ) (z|v = u1 ) that are near zero tend
to occur frequently if the population mean difference E(z|v = u2 ) − E(z|v = u1 ) is near zero
and/or the dispersion of its estimate is large. Hence, estimate (5.8) has subtle sampling behaviour
in such cases. This is the MIV manifestation of the so-called weak instruments problem that has
drawn much attention in the literature on analogue estimation under the HLR and IV assumptions
(see e.g. Nelson and Startz, 1990, Bound, Jaeger, and Baker, 1995, and Staiger and Stock, 1997).
Observe that this weak-instruments problem does not occur in analogue estimation of the
bounds of Propositions 2.1 and 2.2. In those cases, the estimate always varies continuously as
a function of multiple sample averages. Even when an MIV has no identifying power at all, the
bounds of Propositions 2.1 and 2.2 exist and their analogue estimates are consistent.

Proof of Lemma 3.1: Let u2 ≥ u1 . We need to show that E[y(t)|v = u2 ] ≥ E[y(t)|v = u1 ]. The
assumptions imply that

E[y(t)|v = u2 ]−E[y(t)|v = u1 ] = E[y ∗ (t, ζ )|v = u2 ] − E[y ∗ (t, ζ )|v = u1 ]
= E[g(t, ζ, ε)|v = u2 ] − E[g(t, ζ, ε)|v = u1 ]


= g(t, ζ, ε)dP (ζ, ε|v = u2 ) − g(t, ζ, ε)dP (ζ, ε|v = u1 )

 
=
g(t, ζ, ε)dP (ζ |v = u2 ) − g(t, ζ, ε)dP (ζ |v = u1 ) dP (ε)

The first and second equalities apply (3.1) and (3.4). The third equality writes the expectations explicitly
as integrals. The fourth equality applies the assumption that ε is statistically independent of (ζ , v). The
final inequality applies the assumptions that g(t, ·, ε) is monotone and that P (ζ |v = u2 ) weakly dominates
