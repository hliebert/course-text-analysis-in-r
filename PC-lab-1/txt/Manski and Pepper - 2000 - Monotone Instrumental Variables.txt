MONOTONE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES: WITH AN
APPLICATION TO THE RETURNS TO SCHOOLING
BY CHARLES F. MANSKIAND JOHNV. PEPPER'

1. INTRODUCTION

ANALYSES
of treatment response have made extensive use
FORFIFTYYEARSECONOMETRIC
of instrumentalvariable (IV) assumptions holding that mean response is constant across
specified subpopulations of a population of interest.2 Yet the credibility of mean
independence conditions and other IV assumptions has often been a matter of considerable disagreement, with much debate about whether some covariate is or is not a "valid
instrument" in an application of interest. There is therefore good reason to consider
weaker but more credible assumptions. To this end, we introduce monotone instlumental
variable (MIV) assumptions holding that mean response varies weakly monotonically
across specified subpopulations. We study the identifying power of these MIV assumptions and give an empirical application. The findings reported here add to the literature
developing nonparametric bounds on treatment effects.3
This paper uses the same formal setup as Manski (1997). There is a probability space
(J, X2,P) of individuals. Each member j of population J has observable covariates xi E X
and a response function yj( ): T -> Y mapping the mutually exclusive and exhaustive
treatments t E T into outcomes yj(t) E Y. Person j has a realized treatment zj E T and a
1
both of which are observable. The latent outcomes yj(t),
realized outcome y -y(zi),

opportunity to present this work at the 1998 Winter Meeting of the Econometric Society and in
seminars at Duke University, the Federal Reserve Board, Northwestern University, UCLA, the
University of Bristol, the University of Mississippi, the University of Southampton, the University of
Texas at Austin, and the University of Virginia. We have also benefited from the comments of
Jinyong Hahn, Mark Manuszak, and two anonymous reviewers.
2Whereas a variable v was originally called an instrutmentalvariable if v has zero covariance with
a residual 8, the modern usage of the term has broadened to embrace assumptions that specified
functions of v and 8 are orthogonal. Hence it is now necessary to specify the type of IV assumption
one has in mind. Mean independence, quantile independence, and statistical independence assumptions (or the orthogonality conditions that these assumptions yield) have all been prominent in the
literature. See Manski (1988, pp. 25-26 and Section 6.1) for discussion of the history and exposition
of the variety of modern IV assumptions.
3Several contributors to this literature have examined the identifying power of IV assumptions in
the absence of parametric restrictions on the form of response functions. Manski (1990, 1994)
showed that mean independence assumptions imply sharp bounds on mean outcomes and average
treatment effects. Robins (1989) and Balke and Pearl (1997) have considered the statistical
independence assumption that holds in classical randomized experiments, where response functions
are statistically independent of assigned treatments. Hotz, Mullins, and Sanders (1997) have studied
contaminated inistrulment
assumptions. These suppose that a mean-independence assumption holds in
a population of interest, but the observed population is a probability mixture of the population of
interest and one in which the assumption does not hold.

t=zj are not observable. An empirical researcher learns the distribution P(x, z, y) of
covariates, realized treatments, and realized outcomes by observing a random sample of
the population. The researcher's problem is to combine this empirical evidence with
assumptions in order to learn about the distribution P[y( )] of response functions, or
perhaps the conditional distributions P[y( ) Ix].
With this background, we may formally define the MIV assumptions to be studied
here. Let x = (w, v) and X = W x V. Each value of (w, v) defines an observable subpopulation of persons. The familiar mean-independence form of IV assumption is that, for
each t e T and each value of w, the mean value of y(t) is the same in all of the
subpopulations (w, v = u), it E V:
IV ASSUMPTION:Covariate v is an instrumental variable in the sense of mzean-independence if, for each t E T, each value of w, and all (it, u') E (Vx V),
(1)

E[y(t) Iw, v=u'] =E[y(t)

Iw, v =u].

MIV assumptions replace the equality in (1) by an inequality, yielding a mean-monotonicity condition.
MIV ASSUMPTION:
Let V be an ordered set. Covariate v is a monotone instrumental
variable in the sense of mean-monotonicity if, for each t E T, each value of w, and all
(u1, u2) E (VX V) such that U2? u1,
(2)

E[y(t) I w, V= U2]

E[y(t) Iw, v = u1].

To illustrate how IV and MIV assumptions differ, let v measure a person's ability and
consider how wage functions vary with realized schooling. To use v as an IV is to assume
that persons with different measured ability have the same mean wage functions. To use
v as an MIV is to assume that persons with higher measured ability have weakly higher
mean wage functions than do those with lower measured ability. If the type of ability
measured by v is valued in the labor market, it is reasonable to assume that v is an MIV
but not that it is an IV.
Section 2 studies the identifying power of MIV assumptions alone, not combined with
other assumptions. We report sharp bounds on the conditional mean responses E[y(t) I
w, - u], t E V, and the marginal mean E[y(t) Iw]. These bounds are informative if the
outcome space Y is bounded and if the no-assumptions bounds of Manski (1989) are not
monotone increasing in u. The MIV bounds take a particularly simple form in the case of
monotone treatmentselection (MTS), where the realized treatment z is itself an MIV.
Section 3 combines an MIV assumption with the monotone treatmentresponse (MTR)
assumption of Manski (1997):
MTR ASSUMPTION:
Let T be an orderedset. For each j

The MIV and MTR assumptions make distinct contributions to identification. When
imposed together, the two assumptions can have substantial identifying power. Combining the MTR and MTS assumptions yields a particularly interesting finding. Whereas the
MIV-MTR bounds are generally informative only when Y is a bounded outcome space,
the MTS-MTR bounds are informative even if Y is unbounded.

Section 4 presents an empirical application using the MTS and MTR assumptions to
draw conclusions about the returns to schooling. We analyze wage and schooling data in
the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). In this application, the MTS
assumption asserts that persons who realize higher years of schooling have weakly higher
mean wage functions than do those who realize lower levels of schooling. The MTR
assumption asserts that, ceteris paribus, wage rises as a function of conjectured years of
schooling. We find that combining these assumptions yields informative upper bounds on
the returns to schooling. In particular, we find that the average year-by-year return to
college completion relative to high school completion is smaller than some of the point
estimates reported recently by labor economists.
To simplify the exposition in Sections 2 and 3, we henceforth leave implicit the
conditioning on w maintained in the definitions of MIVs. To keep the focus on
identification, we treat identified quantities as known. In the empirical analysis of Section
4, we explicitly condition on specified covariates w and we discuss statistical considerations. Section 5 briefly calls attention to some variations on the MIV theme.
2.

IDENTIFICATION USING AN MIV ASSUMPTION ALONE

We examine here the identifying power of an MIV assumption alone. We focus on the
problem of inference on the conditional means E[y(t) Iv = U], u E V, and the marginal
mean E[y(t)]. The findings are sharp bounds that weaken in obvious ways the sharp IV
bounds of Manski (1990, 1994). Section 2.1 gives the general results and Section 2.2
applies them to monotone treatmentselection, which weakens the familiar assumption of
exogenous treatment selection from an IV to an MIV.
2.1. General Case
The starting point for determination of the identifying power of MIV assumptions is
the no-assumptions bound on E[y(t) Iv] of Manski (1989). Let [Ko, K1] denote the range
of Y. Let u E V. Use the law of iterated expectations and the fact that E[y(t) IL)= U, z =
t] = E(y I v = u, z = t) to write

U).

The sampling process identifies each of the quantities on the right side except for the
censored mean E[y(t) Iv = U, z 7 t], which may take any value in the interval [Ko, K1].
This implies the sharp bound

Hence E[y(t) Iv = u] is no smaller than the no-assumption lower bound on E[y(t) Iv =
u1] and no larger than the no-assumption upper bound on E[y(t) IL.= U2]. This holds for

The MIV bound on the marginal mean E[y(t)] is easily obtained from Proposition 1.

Equation (7) shows that the MIV lower and upper bounds on E[y(t) Iv = u] are weakly
increasing in u. Hence the sharp joint lower (upper) bound on {E[y(t) Iv = u], u E V} is
obtained by setting each of the quantities E[y(t) Iv =u] u E V, at its lower (upper)
bound as given in (7). Inserting these lower and upper bounds into (8) yields the following
corollary.

is shaip.

4Whereas the MIV Assumption (2) implies Proposition 1, the IV Assumption (1) implies that
E[y(t) Iv = i] is constant across ui E V. Hence the common value of E[y(t) Iv = ui], II E V, lies in
the intersection of the bounds (5) across all the elements of V (Manski (1990)).
5Proposition 1 also applies to semi-monotone instrulmental variable assumptions, in which the set V
is only semi-ordered rather than ordered. The inequality (2) holds as stated, it being understood that
there may exist some pairs of covariate values that are not ordered.
6If V is not finite, the result below continues to hold with the summation replaced by a Lebesgue
integral, subject to measurability considerations.

The MIV bounds in Proposition 1 and Corollary 1 necessarily are subsets of the
corresponding no-assumptions bounds and supersets of the corresponding IV bounds.
The MIV and no-assumptions bounds coincide if the no-assumptions lower and upper
bounds on E[y(t) Iv = u] weakly increase with u; in such cases the MIV assumption has
no identifying power. The MIV and IV bounds coincide if the no-assumptions lower and
upper bounds on E[y(t) Iv = u] weakly decrease with u; in such cases, the MIV and IV
assumptions have the same identifying power.
2.2. Monotone TreatmentSelection
Certainly the most commonly applied IV assumption is exogenous treatmentselection
(ETS). Here the instrumental variable v is the realized treatment z. So the IV Assumption (1) becomes the following:
ETS ASSUMPTION:For each t E T,

(10)

VuE T,u'E T.

E[y(t)Iz=u']=E[y(t)Iz=u],

As is well known, this assumption implies that E[y(t)] = E(y Iz = t).
Weakening equation (10) to an inequality yields the special MIV assumption that we
call monotone treatnment
selection (MTS):
MTS ASSUMPTION:Let T be an ordered set. For each t E T,
(11)

U2 ? u1 = E[y(t) Iz = U2] ? E[y(t)

Iz = u1I

Applying Proposition 1 and Corollary 1 yield these sharp MTS bounds:
PROPOSITION1, COROLLARY2: Let the MTS Assunmption (11) hold. Then

? t)

< K1 P(z > t) + E(y Iz = t) P(z < t).

In the absence of other infoimation, these bounds are shaip.
To illustrate the ETS and MTS Assumptions, consider again the variation of wages
with schooling. The ETS Assumption asserts that persons who select different levels of
schooling have the same mean wage functions. The MTS Assumption asserts that persons
who select higher levels of schooling have weakly higher mean wage functions than do
those who select lower levels of schooling. Many economic models of schooling choice
and wage determination predict that persons with higher ability have higher mean wage
functions and choose higher levels of schooling than do persons with lower ability. The
MTS Assumption is consistent with these models but the ETS Assumption is not.

3. IDENTIFICATION COMBINING MIV AND MTR ASSUMPTIONS

We examine here the identifying power of an MIV Assumption of the form (2)
combined with a monotone treatment response assumption of the form (3). Section 3.1
motivates MTR Assumptions and explains how they differ from MIV Assumptions.
Section 3.2 gives the general findings. Section 3.3 focuses on the important special case of
monotone treatment selection and response. Section 3.4 obtains bounds on average
treatment effects.
3.1. MTR Assumptions

Classical econometric analysis of treatment response (Hood and Koopmans (1953))
combines an IV Assumption of form (1) with the linear response assumption
(14)

yj(t) =

t + ?j,

where et is an unobserved covariate. The central finding is that assumptions (1) and (14)
together identify the response parameter /3, provided that z is not mean independent of
u.7 For many years, empirical researchers have applied linear response models even
though these models are not grounded in economic theoiy or other substantive reasoning. The literature has not provided compelling, or even suggestive, arguments in support
of the hypothesis that response varies linearly with treatment and that all persons have
the same response parameter.
Much of the empirical research that has applied linear response models could more
plausibly apply monotone treatment response assumptions of the form (3) stating that,
ceteris paribus, response varies monotonically with treatment. Consumer theory suggests
that, ceteris paribus, the demand for a product weakly decreases as a function of the
product's price. The theoiy of production suggests that, ceteris paribus, the output of a
product weakly increases as a function of each input into the production process. Human
capital theory suggests that, ceteris paribus, the wage that a worker earns weakly
increases as a function of the worker's years of schooling. In these and other settings,
MTR Assumptions have a reasonably firm foundation.
The MIV Assumption (2) and MTR Assumption (3) are distinct in form and they have
distinct implications for the conditional means E[y(t) I = it]. Whereas the MIV Assumption implies the sharp bound given in Proposition 1, the MTR Assumption implies
this sharp bound (Manski (1997, Corollaiy M1.2)):

<E(y

) + K1 P(t >z I )=u).

It is important to understand how the MTS and MTR Assumptions differ from one
another. Consider the variation of wages witlh schooling. It is common to hear the verbal
assertion that "wages increase with schooling." The MTS and MTR Assumptions
interpret this statement in different ways. The MTS interpretation is that persons who
select higher levels of schooling have weakly higher mean wage functions than do those
who select lower levels of schooling; that is, a2 > it
E[y(t) Iz = i] > E[y(t) Iz = ui]
7It can be shown that if assumptioni(1) is weakened to an MIV Assumption of form (2), the value
of : is no longer identified but is bounded. The proof is available from the authors.

for each t E T. The MTR interpretation is that each person's wage function is weakly
increasing in conjectured years of schooling; that is, for each j e J, t2 2 tI y1(t2) ? y1(t1).
Although the MTS and MTR interpretations of the statement "wages increase with
schooling" are distinct, they are not mutually exclusive.8
3.2. GeneralFindings
It is straightforward to combine an MTR Assumption with an MIV Assumption. We
simply repeat the derivation of Section 2.1, with the MTR bound (15) replacing the
no-assumptions bound (5). Let v be an MIV. Then we have the inequality (6). Hence
E[y(t) Iv = u] is no smaller than the MTR lower bound on E[y(t) Iv = u1] and no larger
than the MTR upper bound on E[y(t) Iv = u,]. This holds for all uL < u and all u2 > u.
There are no other restrictions on E[y(t) Iv = u]:

for each u E v. In the absence of other information, this bound is sharp.
The MIV-MTR bound on the marginal mean E[y(t)] is obtained from (16). Recall the
application of the law of iterated expectations given in (8). Proposition 2 shows that the
MIV-MTR lower and upper bounds on E[y(t) Iv = u] are weakly increasing in u. Hence
the sharp joint lower (upper) bound on {E[y(t) Iv = u], u E V} is obtained by setting each
of the quantities E[y(t) Iv = u], u E V, at its lower (upper) bound in (16). Inserting these
lower and upper bounds into (8) yields the following corollary.

sAs discussed earlier, the MTS Assumption is consistent with economic models of schooling
choice and wage determination that predict that persons with higher ability have higher mean wage
functions and choose higher levels of schooling than do persons with lower ability. The MTR
Assumption is consistent with economic models of the production of human capital through
schooling.

3.3. Monotone Treatment Selection and Response

In general, the MIV-MTR bounds on E[y(t) Iv = u] and E[y(t)] are informative only
if the outcome space Y is bounded. Yet there is an important special case in which these
bounds are informative even if Y is unbounded. This is the case of monotone treatment
selection, in which v = z. Application of Proposition 2 yields this MTS-MTR bound on
E[y(t) Iz = u]:

3.4. Bounds on Average Treatment Effects

Propositions 1 and 2 give sharp bounds on mean outcomes under specified treatments.
Let s and t be two such treatments, with s < t. Often the objects of interest are average
9Equation (19) suggests a test of the joint MTS-MTR hypothesis. Under this hypothesis,
E(y Iz = u) must be a weakly increasing function of u. Hence we should reject the hypothesis if
E(y Iz = u) is not weakly increasing in u. This test is a weakened version of the stochastic dominance
test proposed in Manski (1997, p. 1327) for testing the joint hypothesis that treatment response is
monotone and that z is statistically independent of y(Q).

A(s, t)

E[y(t)]

-E[y(s)].

If only an MIV Assumption is imposed, the sharp lower (upper) bound on A(s, t) is
obtained by subtracting the lower (upper) bound on E[y(t)] from the upper (lower)
bound on E[y(s)]. If MIV and MTR Assumptions are imposed, a bound on A(s, t) may
be obtained in the same manner but this bound is not sharp. The general case is complex
to analyze, but the MTS-MTR case is straightforward.
Let u E T. Under the MTS-MTR Assumption, equation (20) gives sharp bounds on
each of E[y(t) Iz = u] and E[y(s) Iz = u]. Inspection of these bounds shows that it is
jointly feasible for E[y(t) Iz = u] to be at its upper bound and E[y(s) Iz = ui] to be at its
lower bound. Thus the MTS-MTR sharp upper bound on A(s, t) is the upper bound on
E[y(t)] minus the lower bound on E[y(s)], namely

Observe that, by (19), the right side of (23) is nonnegative and no smaller than
- E(y Iz = s), which is the value of A(s, t) under the ETS Assumption.
In contrast, it is not jointly feasible for E[y(t) Iz = u] to be at its lower bound and
E[y(s) Iz = u] to be at its upper bound. Placing E[y(t) Iz = u] and E[y(s) Iz = it] at these
limit points yields a nonpositive value for A(s, t). Under the MTR Assumption, however,
the lower bound on A(s, t) must be no less than zero (see Manski (1997) and Pepper
(2000)). Our application of the MTS-MTR assumption in the next section uses (23) as the
upper bound on A(s, t) and zero as the lower bound.

4. EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF THE RETURNS TO SCHOOLING

4.1. MaintainedAssumptions
Labor economists studying schooling as a treatment commonly suppose that each
individual j has a log(wage) function yj(t), giving the log(wage) that j would receive were
he to obtain t years of schooling. In theories of schooling and labor supply, yj( ) is
interpreted as person j's production function for human capital. Observing realized
covariates, schooling, and wages, labor economists often seek to learn features of the
distribution of these production functions in a subpopulation of interest. In particular,
many studies report estimates of the expected returns to completing t years of schooling

relative to s years for s < t, namely A(s, t Iw), where the covariates w define the
subpopulation of interest.10
To infer the returns to schooling, some researchers assume that treatment selection is
exogenous. Others use family and environmental attributes as instrumental variables."
Yet the validity of whatever IV Assumption is imposed seems inevitably to be questioned.
Researchers also often assume, without compelling reason, that log(wage) varies linearly
with conjectured schooling.
The empirical analysis presented here assumes only that treatment selection and
response are monotone. As discussed in Section 3.1, the MTS and MTR Assumptions are
consistent with conventional theories of human capital accumulation. Even if these
assumptions do not warrant unquestioned acceptance, they certainly merit serious
consideration. 12

4.2. Data
We use data from the NLSY. In its base year of 1979, the NLSY interviewed 12,686
persons who were between the ages of 14 to 22 at that time. Nearly half of the
respondents were randomly sampled, the remaining being selected to over-represent
certain demographic groups (see Center for Human Resource Research (1995)). We
restrict attention to the 1,257 randomly sampled white males who, in 1994, reported that
they were full-time year-round workers with positive wages. We exclude the self-employed. Thus our empirical analysis concerns the subpopulation of persons who, in the
notation introduced in Section 1 but since left implicit, have the shared observable
covariates
(24)

w = (white males, full-time year-round workers in 1994,
not self-employed).

We observe each respondent's 1994 hourly wage and realized years of schooling. In
our notation, z is realized years of schooling, the response variable yj(t) is the log(wage)
that person j would experience if he were to have t years of schooling, and yj=yj(zj) is
the observed hourly log(wage).
10The literature on the returns to schooling, as other applied literatures on treatment response,
exhibits varying definitions of the subpopulation of interest. The definition matters substantively
whenever there is concern that treatment response may vary from person to person. Considerations
in defining the subpopulation of interest are discussed in many sources, including Heckman and
Robb (1985), Bjorkland and Moffitt (1987), and Manski (1996). The theoretical analysis in the
present paper applies to any subpopulation of known composition; that is, to a subpopulation
defined by conditioning on observable covariates w. Our analysis does not apply to subpopulations of
unknown composition, such as those defined by Imbens and Angrist (1994) and by Heckman and
Vytlacil (1999) in their studies of local average and local IV treatment effects.
11See, for example, Angrist and Krueger (1991), Blakemore and Low (1984), Blackburn and
Neumark (1993, 1995), Butcher and Case (1994), Card (1993, 1994), Frazis (1993), Garen (1984),
Kenny et al. (1979), Land and Ruud (1986), Murphy and Welch (1989), Oosterbeek (1990), and
Willis and Rosen (1979).
12A potential counter to the MTS Assumption is suggested by Card (1994), who speculates that
ability and taste for schooling may be negatively associated.

4.3. Statistical Consideractions

The bounds developed in Propositions 1 and 2 are continuous functions of various
nonparametrically estimable conditional probabilities and mean responses. In our application, we need only estimate the MTS-MTR upper bound on A(s, t) given in (23). Thus
we need only estimate the probabilities P(z) of realizing z years of schooling and the
expectations E(y Iz) of log(wage) conditional on schooling. For each value of z, we use
the empirical distribution of schooling to estimate P(z) and the sample average log(wage)
of respondents with z years of schooling to estimate E(y Iz). So estimation of the
MTS-MTR upper bound is a simple matter.
Asymptotically-valid sampling confidence intelvals for the bounds may be computed
using the delta method or bootstrap approaches. We apply the percentile bootstrap
method. To be precise, the bootstrap sampling distribution of an estimate of the
MTS-MTR upper bound (23) is its sampling distribution under the assumption that the
unknown population distribution of (realized years of schooling, realized wages) among
persons with the covariates w specified in (24) equals the empirical distribution of these
variables in the sample of 1,257 randomly sampled NLSY respondents. Next to each
upper bound estimate we report the 0.95 quantile of its bootstrap sampling distribution.13
4.4. Findings
Table I gives the estimates of E(y Iz) and P(z) that we use to estimate the MTS-MTR
bounds. The Table shows that 41 percent of the NLSY respondents have 12 years of
schooling and 19 percent have 16 years, but the support of the schooling distribution
stretches from 8 years to 20 years. Hence we are able to report findings on zA(s,t) for
t = 9 through 20 and 8 < s < t.
In Section 3.3 we observed that the MTS-MTR Assumption is a testable hypothesis,
which should be rejected if E(y Iz = u) is not weakly increasing in u. The estimate of
E(y Iz) in Table I for the most part does increase with z, but there are occasional dips.
Computing a uniform 95 percent confidence band for the estimate of E(y Iz), we have
found that the band contains evelywhere monotone functions. Hence we proceed on the
basis that the MTS-MTR Assumption is consistent with the empirical evidence.
Table II reports the estimates and 0.95 bootstrap quantiles of the MTS-MTR upper
bounds on A(t - 1 t), t = 9, ... ,20, followed by the upper bound on A(12,16), which
compares high school completion with college completion. 14 To provide context for these
upper bound estimates, let us review some of the point estimates of zA(t- 1, t) reported
in the recent empirical literature on the returns to schooling. Most of the point estimates
13We caution readers that some applications may not be as straightforward from a statistical
perspective. In general, applications of Proposition 1 and 2 require taking infs and sups of
collections of nonparametric regression estimates. The consistency of the resulting bounds estimates
is easy to establish, but the sampling distributions of these estimates is not yet well understood. A
particular concern is that lower (upper) bound estimates, being sups (infs) of collections of
nonparametric regression estimates, may have non-negligible positive (negative) finite-sample biases.
This concern does not arise in the special case of MTS-MTR bounds, which do not require taking
sups and infs. We do not attempt to resolve the open statistical questions associated with general
applications of MIV bounds in this paper, which is primarily concerned with identification.
14 Point estimates of these treatment effects under the assumption of exogenous treatment
selection may be obtained directly from the first column of Table I. Under the ETS assumption,
A(s,t) = E(y Iz = t) - E(y Iz = s).

cited in the survey by Card (1994) are between 0.07 and 0.09. Card (1993), using a linear
response model and assuming that proximity to college is an IV, reports a point estimate
of 0.132. Ashenfelter

and Krueger (1994), assuming that treatment selection is exogenous

within their sample of twins, report various estimates and conclude that (p. 1171): "our
best estimate is that increased schooling increases average wage rates by about 12-16
percent per year completed."
None of the estimates of upper bounds on A(t - 1, t) in Table II lie below the point
estimates reported in the literature. The smallest of the upper bound estimates are 0.159
for A(13,14) and 0.165 for A(16,17). These are about equal to the largest of the point
estimates known to us, namely those in Ashenfelter and Krueger (1994). It might

therefore appear that the MTS-MTR assumption does not, in this application, have
sufficient identifying power to affect current thinking about the magnitude of the returns
to schooling.
A different conclusion emerges with consideration of the estimate of the upper bound
on A(12, 16). We estimate that completion of a four-year college yields at most an
increase of 0.397 in mean log(wage) relative to completion of high school. This implies
that the average value of the four year-by-year treatment effects A(12,13), A(13,14),
zA(14,15), and A(15,16) is at most 0.099, which is well below the point estimates of Card
(1993) and Ashenfelter and Krueger (1994). This conclusion continues in force if, acting
conservatively, one uses the 0.95 bootstrap quantile of 0.450 to estimate the upper bound
on A(12, 16). Then the implied upper bound on the average value of the year-by-year
treatment effects is 0.113. Thus we find that, under the MTS-MTR assumption, the
returns to college-level schooling are smaller than some of the point estimates reported
recently.

SOME VARIATIONS ON THE THEME

This paper has introduced the general idea of a monotone instrumental variable and
the important special case of monotone treatment selection. It is easy to think of
variations on the MIV theme that warrant study. One would be to combine the MIV idea
with the idea of contaminated instruments introduced by Hotz, Mullins, and Sanders
(1997). Another would be to begin from the statistical independence assumption that
holds in classical randomized experiments and weaken it to a stochastic dominance
assumption. Yet another variation on the MIV theme would be to weaken mean
independence to some form of approximate mean independence.
