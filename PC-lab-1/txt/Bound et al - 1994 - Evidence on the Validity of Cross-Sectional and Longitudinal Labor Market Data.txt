This article investigates error properties of survey reports of labor
market variables. We use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)
Validation Study, a two-wave panel survey of workers employed by
a large firm that shared its detailed payroll records. Individuals' reports
of annual earnings are fairly accurate. Errors are negatively related to
true earnings, reducing bias due to measurement error when earnings
are used as an independent variable. Biases are moderately larger for
changes in earnings. Earnings per hour are less reliably reported than
annual earnings. Biases in estimating earnings functions are relatively
small, but those in labor supply functions may be important.
Research reported in this article was supported by NSF grant SES 86200-86.
Lynn Dielman provided inspired research assistance throughout the data collection
of the second wave of the PSIDVS and in the analysis of those data represented in
this article. We have benefited from comments of participants in the Cornell Labor
Workshop and the Panel Data and Labor Market Studies symposium, Amsterdam.
We also owe special thanks to several members of the personnel and payroll offices
of the firm that cooperated with us in the PSIDVS. We regret that our pledge of
confidentiality precludes listing their names to give them some well-deserved recognition.

I. Introduction

In contrast to most other aspects of labor market phenomena, conventional wisdom about the nature and effects of the measurement
properties of earnings, work hours, tenure, and other key concepts is
based on assumption rather than direct observation. Despite some increase in the attention given to the problem of measurement error, most
empirical studies of labor market behavior ignore it altogether or, at
most, view it as a harmless component of the stochastic disturbance of
their behavioral models.
Measurement error models presented in econometric and statistical textbooks typically make strong-and exceedingly convenient-assumptions
about the properties of the error. Most frequently, measurement error in

a given variable is assumed to be uncorrelated with the true level of that
and all other variables in the model, measurement error in other variables,
and the stochastic disturbance (e.g., see Pindyck and Rubinfeld 1981;
Kmenta 1986). In some applications-such as the case where the error is
a sampling error in estimating a population mean-these assumptions can
be justified. But in most micro data analyses of labor markets, they reflect
convenience rather than conviction. From these assumptions comes much
of the conventional wisdom about the effects of measurement error on
estimates of cross-sectional models: (i) error in the dependent variable
neither biases nor renders inconsistent the parameter estimates but simply
reduces the efficiency of those estimates, and (ii) error in the measurement
of independent variables produces downward-biased and inconsistent parameter estimates, with the extent of bias and inconsistency dependent on
the extent of the error.
For panel data, the conventional wisdom about measurement errors is
much less well defined. The most common assumption is that measurement

errors in a given variable are uncorrelated across time, leading to the conclusion that measures of change produced by panel data are much noisier
than corresponding measures of levels, because differencing increases the
variance of the error but reduces the variance of the true variable. Allowance

for autocorrelation in these errors (as in Griliches and Hausman 1986)
but retention of the other assumptions leads to a focus on the relative sizes
of the error autocorrelation and of the autocorrelation in the true level.
The research summarized in our article is based on direct observation
of the measurement error properties of interview reports of such labor
market measures as earnings, work hours, and tenure. Our principal data
source, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics Validation Study (PSIDVS),
is a unique two-wave panel survey of a probability sample of workers from
a single large manufacturing company. As detailed in the Appendix, some
418 workers were interviewed in the first wave, conducted in the summer
of 1983, using a sampling scheme that produced approximately equal

numbers of hourly and salaried workers and a uniform age distribution.
Interviews were conducted 4 years later with 341 of the original sample
and with 151 additional hourly workers drawn at random from company
employment lists just prior to the interview. The questions asked about
annual earnings, hours, and tenure parallel those used annually for the
PSID, as do the editing and coding procedures.
Access to very detailed company records enabled us to obtain virtually
error-free validation of measures of earnings and hours worked. However,
the advantages of such precise validation are offset to some extent by the
restrictive nature of the single-firm sample: all hourly workers in the firm
are unionized, and the distribution of earnings is much more compressed
within the firm than among general population samples of workers even
within the same industry. Company records for hourly workers also showed
surprising variability in work hours and earnings from one pay period to
the next. The extent to which this variability is unique to this company

or its industry is an important and as yet unanswered issue in considering
how our results may apply to data from larger, more representative samples.
We compare our results to those of Bound and Krueger (1991). Their
direct observation of measurement error is based on matching panel data
on earnings from the March 1977 and 1978 waves of the Current Population
Survey to Social Security Administration (CPS-SSA) earnings records
(which they treat as the true values) for those same individuals. Sample
sizes in this CPS-SSA data set are much larger, and the data are representative of a greater proportion of the workforce. These advantages come at

a cost of some degree of imprecision in the validating information, complications arising from the truncation of earnings in the social security
records, and the lack of validating data for reports of weeks and hours
worked.
Both data sources provide much information to challenge the conventional wisdom. The amount of measurement error in cross-sectional reports
of annual earnings is rather low in both data sets, and the accuracy of
panel survey measures of change in earnings appears to be surprisingly
high. We also find that error in reports of annual work hours is higher,
while error in reports of hourly earnings, obtained by dividing annual
earnings by annual hours, is quite high.
The bias caused by measurement error when In(earnings) is an explanatory variable is greatly reduced by a pronounced negative correlation
between the error and true level of earnings. Such correlations are assumed
to be zero in classical measurement error models but are clearly pervasive
in our data, in Bound and Krueger's data, and in other validation studies.
Classical models of error-induced bias commonly presume zero covariances between measurement errors in each measure and the true levels
of other variables in the model. As with another validation study using a
different data source (Rodgers and Herzog 1987), we find considerable

positively correlated with schooling levels. When hours worked are regressed on the ratio of earnings to hours worked, errors in hours are an
important component of the error in the calculated wage, and the resulting
bias may be severe.
II. Econometric Issues

If one is likely to have measurement error, it is obviously convenient
assume it is of the classical variety. But in most labor market contexts
there is no a priori reason to believe that this assumption is correct. In
addition to providing some evidence about the magnitude of measurement
errors, validation studies permit one to determine whether measurement
errors are indeed uncorrelated with other variables.'
Assume the true model is
Y = Xf3 + ?,

where ? is uncorrelated with X. Instead of X and Y, we observe
X=X + U

and
Y= Y+v.

We will not assume u and v are uncorrelated with X and Y, but we will
assume that ? is uncorrelated with X, u, and v. The motivation for this
last assumption is partly strategic, partly conventional: a validation study
in principle allows us to observe u and v but never ? (so we have little
to say about such correlations), and they are in any case treated in the
literature (e.g., correlation between X and ? leads to a standard "omitted
variable" bias).
In the absence of validation data, the analyst observes only X, and Y.
The least squares estimator of 13 is

b = (X'X) - XT.
We will present a general approach to dealing with measurement errors

in X and g which are correlated with the true X and/or Y. Before doing
so, however, it is useful to highlight a few results that can be derived from
the general approach for the biases due to measurement errors when conl This approach builds on the one taken by Bound and Krueger ( 1991).

venient assumptions hold. To simplify discussion of the various biases, we
assume throughout that the X 's have been defined so that 03 2 0. Consider
three special cases.
First, if there is classical measurement error in only one independent

variable Xj, o} = + s. The proportional bias in estimating hi (i.e.,
minus the ratio of the bias to the true A,1) depends on GU/x). In particular,
with only one independent variable in the regression, the proportional

bias is just equal to this ratio. Alternatively, G&2 /(o(2x + sy2), the ratio of
true to total variance, gives the ratio of the expected value of the estimate
bj to the true by. This is the most common textbook result about measurement error in an independent variable.
Second, even if the error u, is correlated with the true Xj (or other X's),
the proportional downward bias is equal to the regression coefficient for
gjfrom a hypothetical regression of uj on the set of measured )&s. If there
is only one independent variable in the model, this reduces to the simple

regression coefficient bun. (When u and X are uncorrelated, bu. is equal
to the variance ratio Tul/(oTU + (TX). But if u and X are negatively correlated,
bu.n can be smaller than in the classical case. Indeed, it can even be negative.)
Third, if the dependent variable Y is measured with error, and that error
is correlated with the true Y (v = 6Y + v* where v* is uncorrelated with

X, Y, and u) and the X's are measured without error, then the
proportional bias in estimating each f3 is just equal to 6. To emphasize the
similarity to the previous case, note that 6 can be thought of as the regression

coefficient bY.
Each of the above results applies to cross-section analysis and to panel
data by substituting AX for X, etc. But when one uses A)> and AX' as
one' s dependent and independent variables, respectively, another aspect
of the data becomes important-the correlation over time in the true values
(the correlation between Y at time t and at time t - 1, and similarly for
X) and in the measurement errors (the correlation between v at time t and
at time t - 1, and similarly for u). A general result is that, if the variance
of a variable (say, X) is the same in both years, the variance of AX is equal
to 2G&~x(1 - rxtxt l), which is greater or less than c as rx,,x,1 is less than
or greater than one-half. A common concern, usually expressed in the
context of classical measurement errors, is that true values of X will be
highly correlated over time, while the measurement errors will be more

or less uncorrelated. In this case, cGx is less than Gy 2, but a is greater
than Gy, so that moving from "levels" to "changes" intensifies the bias
due to errors in measuring the independent variable(s).
This increase in bias does not necessarily mean that using "change"
variables should be avoided. In most cases, differenced models are used
when the analyst suspects that the error term , contains a component that
is constant over time and, contrary to our assumptions, is correlated with
X (typically because some variable that does not change over time cannot

al.

be measured). In this case, regressing Y on X will produce estimates of

f3 which are biased by both measurement error and the omitted variable,
while regressing A2 on AX) eliminates the latter bias but is likely to increase
biases due to measurement error.
Having highlighted some special cases in which the consequences of
measurement error can be summarized succinctly, we turn to a more general
model. With u and v potentially correlated with X and Y, the least squares
regression coefficient can be rewritten as

b = (X X) -IX'(Xp- up + v + F,)

= p3 + (9\'X) IX'(-Up + v + ?).
Therefore, the bias of the least squares estimator b is

plim b - P = plim(' )-I (-up + v).
It is useful to collect the measurement errors and their coefficients:

w [ulv],
--13

and

plim b- = plim()7'X )-IX 'wy plim Ay.
If there are k separate variables in the independent-variable matrix X,
then A is k by k + 1. It can be rewritten in a more intuitive form as

A = [bu. I b,2],
where the jth column of bux consists of the coefficients from regressing u
on X, and box is the set of coefficients from regressing v on X.

If there is measurement error in only one independent variable Xj, only
one column of A is nonzero, and A( = b~xj, as claimed in our discussion

of special cases. If v = 6Y + v* = 6X13 + 68 + v*, v* is uncorrelated
with the other variables of the model, and the independent variables are
measured without error, then bu, is a matrix of zeros, and bx = by. Thus,
the proportional bias for each coefficient equals 6.
It is also useful to note the analogous expressions among strictly observable variables; that is, before taking plims. Let bR be the ordinary least
squares (OLS) coefficients from regressing Y on X (the record variables),

e be the residual from this regression, and bi be the OL
regressing 2 on X (the interview variables). Then
b= (X'X)-1X'Y

= ( X X (XbR- ubR + V + e)
= bR + (X'X))1X'(-ubR + v + e)
= bR + Ac + (kIA)-lA'e
where

We can calculate bl, bR, A, and c, thus neglecting the
vanishes in the probability limit). The fact that it does not necessarily
vanish in the actual sample data could in principle tell us whether our
assumption is correct that F, the equation error in the model with the
correct variables, is uncorrelated with the measurement errors u and v.
However, in our data this discrepancy is usually small, so we have not
pursued this issue.
III. Measurement Error in Annual Measures of Earnings
Throughout this article, we treat the "record" value of a variable from
the company's own records (PSIDVS) as the "true" value and treat the
difference between the individual's report and this record value as measurement error. We do this because of our confidence in the accuracy and
recording of the company records, in part because of the extraordinary
cooperation of the company involved. This is crucial, because if there were
significant errors in the company records, one would have no way of
knowing how they were correlated with other variables.
In the first row of table 1, we present summary statistics for reports of
1986 earnings from the 1987 (second) wave of the PSIDVS. Our sample
is limited to males (the plant had few females) and excludes cases with
imputed earnings values.2 On average, the interview reports are extremely
accurate-the mean error in In (earnings) is less than .01 -but the standard
2 The PSID edits labor supply information by hand. Such procedures were used
on the PSIDVS data as well. Imputed cases consist of instances of so-called major
assignments where a respondent refusal or (less frequently) uncorrectable interviewer error led to the need for an imputation.

deviation of the error is substantial, amounting to 2/3 of the standard

deviation of the true variable. Consequently, the variance ratio 2 /[Gy2 +
cT] is 0.302. The error is negatively correlated with the true value, which
reduces the bias when ln(earnings) is the explanatory variable (bu. = 0.239
is less than 0.302, the variance ratio) but introduces bias (negative in this

case) when earnings are the dependent variable (bvy = -0.172 < 0).

In the second row of table 1, we delete a half-dozen outliers.3 As it

happens, these are cases with "sensible" values of earnings reported on the
interview (all interview reports lie between $15,000 and $70,000) but with

large errors; they could not be detected as outliers from information typically available to researchers. Thus, our attention to outliers is so that we
can be sure our results are not driven by a few cases, rather than to simulate
the deletion of outliers that researchers often employ (based on interview

data only). A further motivation for discarding outliers is that, for two
observations with large errors in 1986, our detailed examination of the
company records led us to suspect errors in the record values.
The result of deleting these cases is to reduce the importance of measurement error-no surprise here-and to soften the conclusion that the
error is negatively related to the true value. Keeping the outliers but using

3 We treat as an outlier an observation in which the true value, the reported
value, or the measurement error has a value at least 4 standard deviations from that
variable's mean. The standard deviation is recalculated after each deletion.

a "robust regression" estimate (that minimizes the sum of the absolute
deviations rather than the sum of squared deviations) points in the same
direction, reducing to 0.130 the bias when ln(earnings) is the explanatory
variable and to -0.020 the bias when ln(earnings) is the dependent variable.
The middle group of three rows in table 1 presents comparable statistics
for the 1983 wave reports of 1982 earnings. Overall, the biases are somewhat
smaller here, primarily because of larger true earnings variance in 1982, a

year of significant unemployment in the studied firm. The evidence that
errors are negatively related to true values is somewhat stronger for 1982
as well.
The bottom three rows of table 1 focus on the change in ln(earnings)
between 1982 and 1986. The standard deviation of the error in measuring
earnings changes is larger than the error for either year's levels, though
this increase is somewhat limited by a positive correlation between the 2

years' errors. The standard deviation of true earnings is not greatly reduced
by differencing; in these data the correlation between 1982 and 1986 earnings is only .44 (.64 when outliers are deleted). The various bias indicators

are somewhat larger for the change variable than for either of the levels,
though not dramatically so. Again, errors are negatively related to the true
change, so bu>x is less than the variance ratio.
Frequency distributions of the errors themselves are presented in figures
1-3. For each year and the 4-year change in earnings, the distributions are
centered on zero and are very nearly symmetric. They do not follow a
normal distribution, however: a normal distribution would imply that the
interquartile range was 1.33 times the standard deviation, while our interquartile ranges are consistently smaller than the standard deviations. Our
distributions are more concentrated at (near-) zero errors than normality
would imply.
Because our validation study is limited to a single firm, it is natural to
wonder what implications our findings have for broader samples. To address this question requires making some assumption about how the nature
of the measurement error changes as we move toward representative samples. It seems natural to assume that the magnitude of the error in reporting
earnings would go up less rapidly than the variance in true earnings. In
fact, with classical measurement error it might seem natural to assume that
the magnitude of the reporting errors would stay constant across samples.
In this case the magnitude of the bias inherent in using an error-prone
measure would be inversely proportional to the variance of true earnings
in the sample.
Matters are more complicated when the measurement error is correlated
with the true value. The results in table 1 might suggest
u = aX + 0,0

where o is uncorrelated with X and a < 0 accounts for the negative correlation between errors and true values in table 1. This model, however,
implies that the mean error would depend on X in the sample. However,
we find in table 1 that mean errors are essentially zero in our sample of
relatively well-paid workers, and Bound and Krueger report a similar finding in a more representative sample. An alternative assumption is
U = a(X - Xr) + (0

and workers' education, experience, and tenure. Pischke (1992) finds that transitory
earnings are underreported. The "reference group" approach is consistent with
both findings.

constant, too. These assumptions imply that cov(u, X) would be constant

across different samples, which implies that both bux and boy become
smaller in absolute value in samples with more variable earnings.

We combined these assumptions about the errors with estimates of the
variance of interview earnings from the PSID in the corresponding years,5
using samples of all males and of males who remained with the same
employer from 1982 to 1987 (i.e., with 5 years of tenure at the 1987 interview). In the Appendix we compare interview reports of earnings in
these two samples to the PSIDVS; the standard deviation of ln(earnings)
is three times as large for all PSID males as in the PSIDVS and twice as
large for PSID stayers; the standard deviation of the change in ln (earnings)
is about the same for PSIDVS respondents and PSID stayers, but about
70% larger for the full PSID sample.
The results of these calculations are presented in table 2. The main conclusion is that the implied estimates of the biases from errors in reporting
earnings are small when the earnings or change in earnings variables are
based on representative samples of workers but that the more serious biases

find the errors have near-zero means and modest variances and are negatively related to true values, for both the level and change in ln(earnings).

But in most cases we find smaller biases due to measurement error than
they do.

The most unexpected difference is that our estimates of the standard
deviation of the measurement error (which average .13 across the 2 years)
are much smaller than theirs (which average .32). For the change in earn-

ings, our estimate of the standard deviation of the measurement error is
.18, while theirs is .35. Equally striking, the difference is in the tails of the
distribution, because the interquartile ranges for the errors are the same:
they report an interquartile range of .082 (for 1977), while ours are .087
(1986) and .089 (1982).6
The fact that the discrepancy between our findings and those of Bound

and Krueger lies in the tails of the error distribution led us to look at the
(extreme) tails of their data more carefully. Specifically, we focused on
the 26 cases for which (1) social security earnings were below the ceiling
and (2) the ratio of social security to CPS earnings was greater than 5 or
less than .2. Among these "megaoutliers" we see some evidence of earnings
that are missed by the social security records,7 as well as four or five cases
where the CPS report in 1 year is off by a factor of 10, which may well
represent a recording error. Thus, it seems natural to assume that part of
the reason that Bound and Krueger find larger errors than we do has to
do with errors in the social security record and part has to do with CPS
recording errors. But the megaoutliers cannot account for the bulk of the
discrepancy-in 1977 (the year with the greater number of these outliers)
excluding the outliers altogether reduces the standard deviation of the
error by only a fifth.

IV. Measurement Error in Annual Measures of Earnings
per Hour and Hours Worked

The PSIDVS data also include interview and record information on
hours worked per year for hourly (nonsalaried) workers, so one can explore
6 We exclude proxy respondents, while Bound and Krueger's CPS data include
them. But in a supplementary calculation, they compared results for self-reporting
males to those of their broader sample and found little evidence that the selfreporters were appreciably more accurate.
7 Because we had two reports of earnings for 2 adjacent years, we asked which
of the four reports (two sources, 2 years) for each respondent lie furthest from the
overall four-report mean of ln(earnings). We expected that the problems would
be mostly with CPS reports; in fact in 15 of 26 cases it was one of the SSA reports
that seemed "out of line," in all but one case the SSA report being too low. It is
possible that in these cases "true" earnings are changing a lot, and the CPS reports
are incorrectly "too smooth"; but if so, CPS reports of weeks worked must be
smoothed, too, because dividing each earnings variable by the CPS report of weeks
worked that year did not change the pattern.

the biases due to errors in earnings per hour as well.8 These biases turn
out to be more severe than those for annual earnings.9
Table 3 has two panels. The first presents results for hourly earnings,
and the second for hours worked per year. Panel A shows that the biases
arising from using earnings per hour as an explanatory variable are serious.
When the variance ratio is used, the downward bias is two-thirds of the
true value in cross-section analysis, and (unlike annual earnings) the more

general measure b.x gives a very similar estimate. The consequences of
using earnings per hour as a dependent variable are less clear, with proportionate biases of essentially zero and 30% in the two cross sections.
Deleting outliers or using robust regression estimation makes almost no
difference for these results.10 If instead of levels one uses the change in
earnings per hour, matters are worse still-proportional biases of 81% or
85% when the change is the independent variable, and of 33% as a dependent variable.1
Panel B presents the summary statistics for hours per year. Errors in
annual work hours are severe enough to produce nonnegligible biases when
hours are either an independent or a dependent variable. However, the
previously noted errors in earnings per hour are not simply the result of
errors in measuring hours."2 Rather, the problems of measuring earnings
per hour in the PSIDVS data arise from an unhappy combination of errors
in measuring earnings, errors in measuring hours, and the intercorrelations
involved. The correlation between true earnings and hours is very high in
these data, reducing the variance of true earnings per hour, while the correlation between the errors in earnings and hours is much smaller.13
8 We included only those who reported working at least 520 hours but less than
3,500 hours in the year in question.
' Errors in reports of annual earnings by our hourly workers followed the same
general patterns as those of the full sample reported in table 1. For hourly workers,
the evidence that errors are negatively correlated with true values was a bit stronger
for 1982 and 1986 earnings and a bit weaker for the change in earnings.
10 We also investigated whether other measures of earnings per hour based on
last pay period's earnings and hours or on usual weekly earnings and hours appeared
to be preferable to the earnings-per-hour measure based on last year's experience.
In general, our results showed that an annual accounting period produced more
valid reports (Rodgers, Brown, and Duncan 1993).
l Altonji ( 1986) also concludes errors in measuring changes in earnings per hour
are a serious problem, using PSID data and several more complex estimation techniques.

12 It is important to keep in mind that the PSID annual work hours measure is
constructed from an elaborate question sequence asking about work lost to sickness,
vacation, strike, unemployment, and time out of the labor force, and considerable
time is spent on a manual editing of these measures. Simpler question sequences
or less editing may produce greater error variance.
13 The correlation between record ln(earnings) and ln(hours) was .882 in 1986
and .852 in 1982. In contrast, the correlation between the errors in ln(earnings)
and ln(hours) was .347 in 1986 and -.086 in in 1982.

We also combined the PSIDVS evide
of reported earnings per hour and of reported hours in the PSID (table
4). Overall, the results suggest that biases from errors in earnings per hour
are more serious than for annual earnings, but particularly for the variance

ratio and bux the biases are likely to be less severe in a national sample
than PSIDVS data alone (table 3) would suggest. If one focuses on those
who remain with their employer (the "stayers"), the biases may well be
very serious. Errors in measuring hours per year can generate biases of
15%-20% when hours per year are used as either the dependent variable
or the independent variable. In Section V we consider the biases that arise
when both earnings per hour and annual hours appear in the same equation,
as in studies of labor supply.
V. Implications for Earnings Functions and
"Labor Supply" Functions

As an illustration of the more general methodology, we present an ana
ysis of the consequences of measurement error for estimates of a simple
earnings function and a regression of hours worked on earnings per hou
For our earnings function, we regress the logarithm of annual earnings

education, tenure (years with current employer), and experience.14 A
often done in such contexts, our measure of experience is age - schooling

Survey data but had been restricted to information provided by the employers of
CPS respondents. Since there was no other attempt to verify the employer information, their data are best thought of as two fallible indicators of the underlying
wage and other employment conditions. They find very few differences between
coefficients obtained from the interview and employer data.

- 5. We focus on cross-sectional estimation, because the change in our
explanatory variables is either zero (education) or approximately constant
(experience, company tenure).

We have interview and record values of earnings and tenure; as it turns
out, errors in the latter are negligible, so our emphasis is on the impact of
errors in reporting earnings, and in particular whether they are correlated

with the explanatory variables. We have no independent verification of
education (as reported in the interview) or experience.15 Given that these
seem likely a priori to be relatively well-measured, and that we have no
independent way of verifying workers' reports, we assume these variables
are measured without error.

Table 5 is an elaboration of the algebraic relationship among b1, bR, c,
and A (from Section II). Column 1 gives values of b1, regression coefficients
based on interview data. Column 2 gives values of bR, based on the record
data, and hence (apart from sampling error) gives the "true" coefficients.
Since only tenure and In(earnings) are assumed to be measured with error,
the A matrix has only two nonzero columns, these being columns 3 and
4 of the table. Panel A of table 5 refers to the 1986 cross section, while
panel B refers to the 1982 data.
The estimated coefficients of the earnings function, based on the interview
data (b1), are similar to what one finds in the literature, with two exceptions.

First, they are generally smaller in absolute value, because our data refer
to one firm, and part of the return to education and experience comes
from access to higher-paying firms. Second, the coefficient of experience
is negative in the 1986 data, which is not what one finds in other data sets.
Differences between the coefficients obtained from record data and interview data may come from three sources: a relationship between the

error in tenure and the measured X, buTenurex; a relationship between the
error in earnings and measured X, bx; or the residual discrepancy. In
table 5, the relationship between the error in tenure and the measured
variables (including measured tenure) is negligible, because these workers

are able to report their tenure very accurately.16 However, errors in measuring earnings are related to education in the 1986 data and to tenure in
the 1982 data (t-ratios of 2.0 and 1.6, respectively). As a result, the proportionate difference between b1 and bR in these cases is not negligibleinterview data overstate the record return to education in 1986 by 40%
(when nothing is done about outliers) and understate the return to tenure

15 Our experience variable is, as noted above, calculated from information on
age and education. The latter is from company records (but the information was
initially provided by the workers), and the former is from workers' interview
reports.

16 The correlation between reported and true tenure exceeded .99 in each year.

ln(earnings) on measured values of variables like those in table 5 (plus additional
demographic variables such as marital status and region). They find small coefficients
that are not very stable across 2 adjacent years.

be correlated with true values of the regressors, there is
a pattern in other data sets based on these results.

Because PSIDVS has data on hours worked as well as annual earnings
for hourly workers, we can analyze the effects of errors in both variables
for regressions of hours worked on earnings per hour. Particularly given
our one-firm sample, we are reluctant to interpret this as a "labor supply"
regression (Abowd and Card 1989).
Using the notation of Section II, let Y be the logarithm of hours worked
per year and X be the logarithm of annual earnings divided by hours
worked, so that v is the error in measuring hours and u is the error in the
computed hourly wage. Then the biases introduced by measurement error

depend on the two components of A, bux) and box:

plim b - f = -ibex + box.
The first term is the "usual" errors-in-variables bias discussed in Section
III. The second term may be nonzero both because of "division bias"
(errors in hours appear in both the dependent variable and the denominator
of the hourly wage) and because errors in hours are negatively related to
true hours (and therefore presumably related to the wage). From table 3,

the estimates of bux are .666 (1986), .737 (1982), and .853 (change). Comparable estimates of box are -.319, -.339, and -.450. Unfortunately,

PSIDVS is not very helpful in estimating f3 directly-when record values
of the variables are used, the estimates are .40 (.09) in 1986, -.28 (.15) in
1982, and -.42 (.25) for the change-so our conclusions must be conditional on the true P3. If the true , is zero, all of the bias comes from the
bx term, the correlation between errors in hours and the computed wage.
Note that this is an absolute rather than relative bias-the estimated coefficient would be -.3 in the cross section and -.45 for the changes. But as
we noted earlier, this bias would be considerably smaller in a sample with
greater variance in the true wage. If, however, the true , is large and
positive, as implied by some models of intertemporal labor supply, the
first term is dominant, and tables 3 and 4 summarize the likely biases.
VI. Conclusions

The validation data set used in this article produces a number of f
that contradict assumptions made in and implications drawn from t
tional measurement error models. The major caveat in assessing our f
is that our data are drawn from a single firm. The most important
of this restriction is probably that the variances of true earnings,
and earnings per hour are smaller in our sample than in representative
national samples. This argues for adjusting various bias indicators downward in thinking about their implications for national samples, and our
adjustments are undoubtedly less precise than other parts of the analysis.

We
find
that
annu
the errors in measuring In(earnings) would bias its coefficient when used
as an independent variable by 4%-24%, with the range reflecting both
variation across the 2 years and different treatment of outliers. Bias is
reduced by the tendency for errors to be negatively related to true values;
but this correlation also means that there is some bias (2%-17%) when
In(earnings) is used as a dependent variable. These biases would probably
be regarded as fairly small in many applications; with increased true variance
in earnings in national samples, the biases would be smaller still. There

was also a surprisingly small increase in the importance of measurement
error when going from cross-sectional measures of earnings level to panel
measures of annual earnings change-there was more "news" than "noise"
when earnings were differenced over either 1- or 4-year intervals. These
findings are qualitatively similar to those of Bound and Krueger (1991);
probably the most important difference is that we find fewer extremely
inaccurate reports of earnings in our data than they found in theirs.
We also found nonzero covariances between earnings error and righthand-side measures such as education and job tenure. However, variability
in the estimates of these covariances (between years and across different
treatment of outliers) leaves us unable to assert with confidence what these
covariances and likely biases will be in general population data sets.
We found evidence of more serious biases from errors in measuring
earnings per hour, defined as the ratio of annual earnings to annual hours.
In the PSIDVS sample, the variance of the error was twice the value of
the true value, and even larger if changes in earnings per hour are considered. Again, these biases would be smaller in a representative sample, with
larger true variance in earnings per hour. But for the change in hourly
earnings, biases on the order of 30% seem plausible given our results even
in such samples. And in more restricted samples, such as those who remain
with their employer over a 4-year period, biases errors in measuring the
change in earnings per hour are likely to be even more severe.
Earnings per hour are often used to explain hours worked, using either
levels or changes. In this context we need to worry not only about the
error in measuring earnings per hour but also about the possibility that
errors in measuring hours are correlated with our earnings-per-hour variable. We find that if the true coefficient of earnings per hour is small, the
latter problem may be particularly important, even leading to wrong-signed
estimates. But if the true coefficient is large and positive, the more usual
problem of measuring the explanatory variable is most important.
Reporting errors also have important implications for analyses of earnings dynamics. Pischke (1992) has used the PSIDVS to study this issue in
some depth. He finds that many features of the PSIDVS data can be characterized by a model in which individuals underreport transitory components to their earnings. The implication of this is that, while the mea-

surement error in earnings introduces excess volatility into earnings
dynamics, it does so less than had errors been uncorrelated with the transitory component of earnings.
Taken together, the results show a need to recognize the potential importance of measurement error and to incorporate more realistic assump-

tions about the properties of such error into measurement error models.
Mean-reverting (i.e., negative) covariances between the error and true level
of a given measure were pervasive in our data. Building realistic (i.e., nonzero) assumptions about these covariances into measurement error models
will complicate the conventional wisdom regarding measurement errors
but also force researchers to consider whether conventional assumptions
are warranted in their models. A useful by-product of these considerations
is the recognition of the need for direct measurement of the covariances
through validation studies.
We believe that additional survey-based validation studies of labor market
panel data are needed. The evidence on errors in reports of hourly earnings
in our data suggests particular attention to this variable. Further work
would allow researchers to determine whether the variability (between
pay periods) in work hours and earnings that characterizes our firm is
unusual (and if so whether such variability influences the accuracy of the
survey reports). Testing new methods for motivating respondents to provide high-quality survey information would yield both additional evidence
on errors in traditional surveys and indications of how such errors might
be reduced.
Appendix

The Panel Study of Income Dynamics Validation Study
The validation study providing data for this article gathered interview
and company record data from a single large manufacturing firm with
several thousand employees. The firm's hourly workforce is completely
unionized, and virtually all workers, both hourly and salaried, work fulltime. At the time of the initial interviewing in the summer of 1983, the
company workforce was considerably older (and had more job tenure)
than was true of a national sample of workers, in part resulting from
layoffs and relatively few new hires in the 2 years prior to the initial
interview. These deviations were offset by a sampling procedure that
stratified the employee list by age and type of worker (hourly vs.
salaried) and selected a larger proportion of younger and salaried
workers.
The resulting 1983 sample was evenly divided between salaried and
hourly workers and had a fairly uniform age distribution. Interviews
were conducted by telephone with a questionnaire similar to that used

in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, with 418, or 78.3%, of the 534
potential respondents (or proxies) completing interviews. A more detailed

explanation of study procedures involved in the initial round of interviewing is given in Duncan and Mathiowetz (1985).
A second round of interviewing was conducted in the summer of
1987 with the 1983 respondents and a fresh sample of hourly workers.
Some 122 of the individuals with whom interviews were attempted in
1983 had retired, left the company for other reasons, had unlisted
telephone numbers, or for some other reason were not appropriate
potential 1987 respondents. Reinterviews were successfully conducted
with 341, or 82.4%, of the remaining 1983 sample; 275 individuals
were respondents in both 1983 and 1987. Given the much richer
company record information available for hourly workers, it was
decided that additional interviews should be conducted only on hourly

workers. An additional random sample of 202 hourly workers was
drawn, and interviews were successfully conducted with 151, or 75%,
of them. Thus, the 1987 data collection had a total of 492 interviews,
with a total response rate of 79.9%.
We compared interview reports of earnings and work hours from the
1983 and 1987 validation study samples to data from the Panel Study of
Income Dynamics (see table Al). The distributions of annual and hourly
earnings for the validation study sample have considerably higher means
and much lower variance than for the national samples (and this remains
true even when those national samples are restricted to unionized hourly
workers in durable manufacturing industries and the validation sample
is restricted to hourly workers). The reduced variance has implications
for the generalizability of findings about the extent of measurement
error found for the validation study sample.
Validation sources were company payroll records and company "activity
records" showing for hourly workers a daily accounting of work or
unemployment. Our analysis of the interview data is restricted to
information for which there was a very close match between the
information sought in the questionnaire and the information available
in the company records and for which validating information was judged
likely to be highly accurate. Interview and company records were
compared to identify cases with substantial apparent reporting error.
Both interview and record information in all such cases were rechecked
to ensure that differences were not the result of coding errors.
