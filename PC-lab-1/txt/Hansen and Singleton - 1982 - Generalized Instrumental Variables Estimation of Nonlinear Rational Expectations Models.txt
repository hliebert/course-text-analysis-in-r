GENERALIZED INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES ESTIMATION
OF NONLINEAR RATIONAL EXPECTATIONS MODELS'
BY LARS PETER HANSEN AND KENNETH J. SINGLETON
This paper describes a method for estimating and testing nonlinear rational expectations
models directly from stochastic Euler equations. The estimation procedure makes sample
counterparts to the population orthogonality conditions implied by the economic model
close to zero. An attractive feature of this method is that the parameters of the dynamic
objective functions of economic agents can be estimated without explicitly solving for the
stochastic equilibrium.

1. INTRODUCTION
THE ECONOMETRIC IMPLICATIONS of

dynamic rational expectations models in
which economic agents are assumed to solve quadratic optimization problems,
subject to linear constraints, have been analyzed extensively in [11, 12, 25, 29,
and 30]. Linear-quadratic models lead to restrictions on systems of constant
coefficient linear difference equations, which provide complete characterizations
of the equilibrium time paths of the variables being studied. Hence, the parameters of these models can be estimated using the rich body of time series
econometric tools developed for the estimation of restricted vector difference
equations [e.g., 11, 20, and 32]. Once the linear-quadratic framework is abandoned in favor of alternative nonquadratic objective functions, dynamic rational
expectations models typically do not yield representations for the variables that
are as convenient from the standpoint of econometric analysis. Indeed, in many
models, closed-form solutions for the equilibrium time paths of the variables of
interest have been obtained only after imposing strong assumptions on the
stochastic properties of the "forcing variables," the nature of preferences, or the
production technology. See, for example, the models in Merton [24], Brock [4],
and Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross [5].
The purpose of this paper is to propose and implement an econometric
estimation strategy that circumvents the theoretical requirement of an explicit
representation of the stochastic equilibrium, yet permits identification and estimation of parameters of economic agents' dynamic (nonquadratic) objective
functions, as well as tests of the over-identifying restrictions implied by the
theoretical model. The procedures we propose do not require a complete, explicit
representation of the economic environment and, in particular, do not require
strong a priori assumptions about the nature of the forcing variables. Consequently, estimation and inference can be conducted when only a subset of the
economic environment is specified a priori. While our strategy involves specifying
the objective functions of a subset of agents, it is distinct from specifying the

decision rules (e.g., dynamic demand or supply schedules) of a subset of agents
without specifying the entire economic environment.2 The latter approach is
characteristic of many applications of limited information methods to conventional simultaneous equations models. Lucas [21] has criticized this approach by
noting that, under the assumption of rational expectations, the dynamic decision
rules of economic agents depend explicitly on the stochastic specification of the
forcing variables and possibly the structural specification of the entire economic
environment.
The basic idea underlying our estimation strategy is as follows. The dynamic
optimization problems of economic agents typically imply a set of stochastic
Euler equations that must be satisfied in equilibrium. These Euler equations in
turn imply a set of population orthogonality conditions that depend in a
nonlinear way on variables observed by an econometrician and on unknown
parameters characterizing preferences, profit functions, etc. We construct nonlinear instrumental variables estimators for these parameters in the manner suggested by Amemiya [1, 2], Jorgenson and Laffont [18], and Hansen [10] by
making sample versions of the orthogonality conditions close to zero according
to a certain metric. An important feature of these estimators is that they are
consistent and have a limiting normal distribution under fairly weak assumptions
about the stochastic processes generating the observable time series. Also, more
orthogonality conditions are typically available for use in estimation than there
are parameters to be estimated and, in this sense, the models are "overidentified." The overidentifying restrictions can be tested using a procedure,
justified in Hansen [10], that examines how close sample versions of population
orthogonality conditions are to zero.
Other authors have proposed using stochastic Euler equations to estimate
parameters (but1not test restrictions) in the context of models containing linearquadratic optimization problems (e.g., Hayashi [16] and Kennan [19]). By focusing on the Euler equations in these linear models, some of the restrictions implied
by the model are ignored at the gain of computational simplicity (see Hansen
and Sargent [13]). In addition to computational simplicity, there is perhaps a
more compelling reason for using instrumental variables procedures in the
nonlinear environments considered here. Namely, there is the added difficulty of
obtaining a complete characterization of the stochastic equilibrium under weak
assumptions about the forcing variables.3 Fair and Taylor [7] proposed an
alternative, approximate maximum likelihood procedure that can be applied to
2By the economic environment we mean a specification of preferences, technology, and the
stochastic process underlying the forcing variables. By a decision rule we mean a rule used by
economic agents to determine the current period "decision" as a function of the current "state" of the
economy.
3The procedures discussed in this paper are also of use in quadratic optimization environments
when it is important to allow conditional variances to be dependent on variables in the information
set. Allowing for these dependencies complicates decision rule derivation and does not permit use of
conventional asymptotic distribution theory results for instrumental variables estimators. See Section
3 for further discussion of these issues.

an equation system that includes a set of stochastic Euler equations. By imposing
certainty equivalence on the nonlinear rational expectations model, they circumvent some of the difficulties in obtaining a complete characterization of the
stochastic equilibrium. The instrumental variables procedure proposed here
avoids their approximations for an important class of models.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the class of
stochastic Euler equations that can be used in estimation is discussed, and then
an example from the literature on multi-period asset pricing is presented. In
Section 3 the generalized instrumental variables estimator is formulated, and its
large sample properties are discussed. In Section 4 this estimator is compared to
the maximum likelihood estimator in the context of a nonlinear model of stock
market returns. This discussion contrasts the orthogonality conditions exploited
by the instrumental variables estimator with those exploited by the maximum
likelihood estimator when a specific distributional assumption is made. In
Section 5 results from applying the generalized instrumental variables estimator
to this stock return model are presented. Finally, some concluding remarks are
made in Section 6.
2. THE IMPLICATIONS OF RATIONAL EXPECTATIONS MODELS
USED IN CONSTRUCTING ESTIMATORS

Discrete-time models of the optimizing behavior of economic agents often lead
to first-order conditions of the form:
(2.1)

Eth(xt+? bo)

=

0,

where xt+n is a k dimensional vector of variables observed by agents and the
econometrician as of date t + n, bo is an 1 dimensional parameter vector that is
unknown to the econometrician, h is a function mapping Rk X R' into Rm, and
Et is the expectations operator conditioned on agents' period t information set, It.
Expectations are assumed to be formed rationally and, hence, Et denotes both
the mathematical conditional expectation and agents' subjective expectations as
of date t. For the purposes of this paper, we shall think of equation (2.1) as
emerging from the first-order conditions of a representative agent's utility maximization problem in an uncertain environment. Our procedures can also be
applied with some modification to models of panel data in which (2.1) represents
the first-order conditions associated with the optimum problems of heterogeneous agents, so long as the heterogeneity is indexed by individual characteristics
observed by the econometrician. More generally, our approach to estimation is
appropriate for any model that yields implications of the form (2.1) with x
observed. This latter qualification does rule out some models in which the
implied Euler equations involve unobservable forcing variables.
An example will be useful both for interpreting (2.1) and understanding the
estimation procedure discussed in Section 3. Following Lucas [22], Brock [4],
Breeden [3], and Prescott and Mehra [26], suppose that a representative con-

where Ct is consumption in time period t, fi Ee(0, 1) is a discount factor, and
U(.) is a strictly concave function. Further, suppose that the consumer has the
choice of investing in a collection of N assets with maturities Mj, j= 1, . .. , N.
Let Qjt denote the quantity of asset j held at the end of date t, Pj, the price of
asset j at date t, Rjt the date t payoff from holding a unit of an M1-periodasset
purchased at date t -MA1j, and W, (real) labor income at date t.4 All prices are
denominated in terms of the consumption good. The feasible consumption and
investment plans must satisfy the sequence of budget constraints

If, for example, the jth asset is a default-free, zero coupon bond with term to
maturity Mj, then Rjt+M' in (2.4) equals the real par value of the bond at date
t + Mj. Alternatively, if t denotes the quantity of shares of stock of a firm held
at date t, Djt denotes the dividend per share of stock j at date t, and Mj = 1, then
Rjt+I= (Pjt+I + Djt+) and (2.4) becomes
(2.5)

PjtU'(Ct )

fEt[(Pjt+ I + Djt+ 1) U'(Ct+ 1)

with Pjt interpreted as the exdividend price per share. Note that (2.5) is a
generalization of the model studied by Hall [9] in which preferences were
quadratic and real interest rates were assumed to be constant over time.
Estimation and testing using (2.4) or (2.5) requires that the function U be
explicitly parameterized. For the moment, we assume only that preferences are
described by a vector of parameters -y, U(-, y), in order to emphasize the
generality of our estimation strategy. At this level of generality, the representative
agent assumption plays a critical role in the derivation of (2.4) and (2.5).
4This income term W, could emerge under the assumption that labor is supplied inelastically. In
this case W, can be thought of as not being controllable by the representative consumer. Alternatively, we can introduce a period t labor supply variable L4 into the specification of U and let
U(Ct, Lt)-=U, (Ct ) -U2(4t)

where L, is a choice variable of the consumer. For this case, W, = L4wtwhere wt is the real wage rate
at period t.

Rubinstein [28] has shown, however, that (2.4) and (2.5) can implicitly accommodate certain types of heterogeneity when agents' preference functions are members of the HARA class. In Sections 4 and 5, we consider in detail the special
case of (2.5) with a constant relative risk averse preference function. Using a
theorem in Rubinstein [28], this version of (2.5) can be derived from a model in
which agents are allowed to have different stochastic endowment streams.
Relation (2.4) can be used to construct the h function specified in (2.1).
Suppose the econometrician has observations on Pi and Rj for a subset of m of
the assets (m < N) with maturities n , n2, . .. ., nm, and on consumption C. Since
C, and Pjtare known to agents at time t, (2.4) implies

Notice that x has m + n* coordinates.
We can interpret
Ut+n = h(xt+n?bo)

as the disturbance vector in our econometric estimation. The matrix Eutut' is
assumed to have full rank. This assumption implicitly imposes some structure
on the link between u and the "forcing variables" not observed by the
econometrician that enter, for example, through the production technology. The
autocovariance structure of u depends on the nature of the assets being studied.
If the m assets are stocks and n1 through n equal unity, for example, then
h (xt + I, bo) is constructed from the Euler equations by setting Xjt + 1 = (Pjt +1 +
Djlt+)/Pt. In this case, u is serially uncorrelated, since observations on xt ,
s ? 0, are contained in It and Et[h(xt+ 1,bo)] = 0. On the other hand, if n > 1 for
somej, as in the model of the term structure of bond prices implied by (2.4), the
condition Ej[h(xt+n, bo)] = 0 does not preclude serial correlation in u. This can
be seen by noting that x + - is not necessarily included in It if nj > 1. The

presence of serial correlation in u leads to a more complicated asymptotic
covariance matrix for our proposed estimator, but it does not affect consistency
(see Section 3).
Before describing our estimation strategy in detail, we briefly consider what is
perhaps a more "natural" approach to estimation in order to help motivate our
approach. A possible way of proceeding with estimation is: (i) to explicitly
specify the rest of the economic environment, including the production technology and the stochastic properties of the forcing variables; (ii) to solve for an
equilibrium representation for the endogenous variables in terms of past endogenous variables and current and past forcing variables; and (iii) to estimate the
parameters of tastes, technology, and the stochastic process governing the forcing
variables using a full information procedure such as maximum likelihood. This
approach will yield an exact relationship among current and past endogenous
variables and current and past forcing variables. To avoid an implication of a
stochastic singularity among variables observed by the econometrician, it can be
assumed that the econometrician does not have observations on some of the
forcing variables. This approach is viable if both the form of (2.1) and the
stochastic specification of the forcing variables are relatively simple. To allow for
a general representation of the forcing variables, explicitly solve for an equilibrium representation of the observables, and proceed to estimate the parameters
of tastes and technology together with the parameters of the forcing processes
appears to be an overly ambitious task outside of linear environments.5 For this
reason we adopt an alternative estimation strategy that can be viewed as an
extension to nonlinear environments of the procedures of McCallum [23] and
Cumby, Huizinga, and Obstfeld [6] for estimating linear rational expectations
models.
3. ESTIMATION

In this section we describe how to estimate the vector bo using a generalized
instrumental variables procedure. The basic idea underlying our proposed estimation strategy is to use the theoretical economic model to generate a family of
orthogonality conditions. These orthogonality conditions are then used to construct a criterion function whose minimizer is our estimate of bo. This criterion
function is constructed in a manner that guarantees that our parameter estimator
is consistent, asymptotically normal, and has an asymptotic covariance matrix
that can be estimated consistently. The orthogonality conditions also can be used
to construct a test of the overidentifying restrictions implied by the theoretical
model. We elaborate on each of the steps in the following discussion.
Let ut+ = h (x, + n, bo) and consider again the first-order conditions
(3.1)

Ej[ut+n] = 0,

with the additional assumption that the m constituents of ut,n have finite second
5Even in linear environments this is a nontrivial econometric endeavor. See Hansen and Sargent
[11, 12] and Sargent [30] for a discussion of these issues in linear environments.

moments. Also, let zt denote a q dimensional vector of variables with finite
second moments that are in agents' information set and observed by the
econometrician; and define the function f by
(3.2)

f(xt+W,tz b) = h(Xt+n,b)

0 Zt,

where f maps R k x R q X R ' into R r r = m - q, and 0 is the Kronecker product.
Then an implication of (3.1), (3.2), and the accompanying assumptions is that

where E is the unconditional expectations operator.6 Equation (3.3) represents a
set of r population orthogonality conditions from which an estimator of bo can be
constructed, provided that r is at least as large as the number of unknown
parameters, 1.
We proceed by constructing an objective function that depends only on the
available sample information {(x +n, Z1), (X2+n, Z2)' . . . (XT+n, ZT)} and the
unknown parameters. Let go(b) = E [f(x, +n,Z,, b)], where b E R' and it is assumed that the left-hand side does not depend on t. Note that (3.3) implies that
go has a zero at b = bo. Thus, if the model underlying (3.1) is true, then the
method of moments estimator of the function go,

evaluated at b = b0, gT(bo), should be close to zero for large values of T. Given
this fact, and the assumption that f is continuous in its third argument, it is
reasonable to estimate bo by selecting bT from a parameter space 52C R' that
makes gT in (3.4) "close" to zero. In this paper, we follow Amemiya [1,2],
Jorgenson and Laffont [18], and Hansen [10] and choose bT E 2 to minimize the
function JT given by
(3.5)

gT(b)'WTgT(b),

where WT is an r by r symmetric, positive definite matrix that can depend on
sample information. The choice of the weighting matrix WT defines the metric
used in making gT close to zero.
Sufficient conditions for strong consistency and asymptotic normality of
estimators constructed in this fashion are provided in Hansen [10].7 A few key
6A researcher may wish to use a (possibly different) subvector of z to form the orthogonality
conditions for each element of utn. Modifications to the following analysis to account for this
possibility are straightforward.
7Hansen [101assumes that the parameter space is compact, that continuity conditions are satisfied
for the 3h/ab, and that the stochastic process {(x,,Z,)),=I is stationary and ergodic. Presumably
these assumptions can be relaxed, perhaps along the dimensions proposed by White [331 for
cross-sectional analysis. In relaxing these assumptions it is important to consider the impact not only
on estimation, but on model specification as well. Many theoretical rational expectations models rely
on some form of stationarity to derive time invariant relationships.

observations are important. First, it is not necessary to specify how E,[u,+nu,+nt]
depends on elements in the information set as of time t. That is, we can allow
to be conditionally heteroskedastic and can conduct statistical inference
Ut+n
without explicitly characterizing the dependence of the conditional variances on
the information set. In the context of the asset pricing models discussed in
Section 2, for example, this feature of our estimation procedure allows the
conditional variances of asset yields to fluctuate with movements of variables in
the conditioning information set. Thus, we can accommodate the assumption in
Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross [5] that the conditional variances of interest rates vary
with the level of past interest rates.
Second, we can think of these estimators as instrumental variables estimators
where Zt denotes the vector of instruments. For this reason, we refer to our
estimators as generalized instrumental variables estimators. We require only that
the z's be "predetermined" as of time period t; they need not be "econometrically exogenous." For example, current and lagged x's can be chosen.
Furthermore, as noted in Section 2, u will generally be serially correlated when
n > 1. Our estimators will be consistent even when the disturbances are serially
correlated and the instruments are not exogenous. From the standpoint of
obtaining a consistent estimator, a researcher is given considerable latitude in
selecting zt.
Third, the asymptotic covariance matrix for these generalized instrumental
variables estimators depends on the choice of weighting matrix WT. It is possible
to choose WT "optimally" in the sense of constructing an estimator with the
smallest asymptotic covariance matrix among the class of estimators employing
alternative choices of weighting matrices WT. More precisely, assume that h is
differentiable, and that the vector of instruments Zt is chosen such that the matrix

D?= E a (Xt+nWbo)0Zt],
has full rank. Also, assume that the weighting matrix WTconverges almost surely
to a limiting constant matrix W0 of full rank. Let

with the number of population autocovariances, n, determined by the order of
the moving average disturbance term ut. Assuming that S0 has full rank,
Hansen's [10] Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 imply that the smallest asymptotic covariance matrix for an estimator bT that minimizes (3.5) is obtained by letting W0 be
Wo*= S0-. The resulting asymptotic covariance matrix is (D6Wo*DO)f
In order to implement this "optimal" procedure and to conduct asymptotically
valid inference we need consistent estimators of Do and Wo*.These matrices can

Note that to compute WT in actual applications, a consistent estimator bT of bo is
needed. This can be obtained by initially using a suboptimal choice of WT in
minimizing (3.5) to obtain bT. Then this bT can be employed to calculate WT
using the formulas supplied above. Once WTis calculated, b* can be obtained by
minimizing (3.5) with WT substituted for WT. Thus, the "optimal" estimation
procedure requires two steps.
The optimal properties of the bT estimator proposed above are, in one sense,
weak. Nowhere did we offer any precise suggestions about how to choose zt
optimally from the information set as of time t. The solution to this problem is
discussed in Hansen and Singleton [15].9 The general solution for Zt may not be
operational because it requires the researcher to make precise assumptions about
the entire economic environment. Nevertheless, there are potentially important
special cases in which the optimal choice of Zt can be used for estimation of
models like (2.1).
Before concluding this section, we consider a straightforward way of testing
the restrictions implied by the model. The estimation procedure sets the I linear
combinations of the r orthogonality conditions associated with the first-order
conditions to the minimization problem (3.5) equal to zero in estimating bo:

8If n > 1, then WT in (3.6) is not positive definite by construction. Alternative spectral estimators
that are positive definite by construction are available [e.g., 10 and 13]; however, these estimators do
not exploit the fact that the defining sum for S only involves a finite number of terms.
In practice, one may wish to remove the product of the sample means gT(bT)gT(bT)'
from the
cross-products f(X1+ n, Zt, bT)f(xt + n-z s,
bT)' when computing RT(i) in (3.6). Under the null
hypothesis, this adjustment has no effect on the asymptotic properties of the test statistics or
parameter estimates. Under some alternative hypotheses, not all elements of gT(bT) are expected to
be near zero. In these circumstances the sample mean corrections may have important effects on the
values of the test statistics and, hence, the power of the tests.

and Sargent [131 and Hayashi and Sims [17].

Thus, when r > 1, there are r - 1 remaining linearly independent orthogonality
conditions that are not set to zero in estimation, but should be close to zero if the
model restrictions are true. To test these overidentifying restrictions, we invoke a
theorem in Hansen [10] that implies that T times the minimized value of (3.5) for
an optimal choice of WT is asymptotically distributed as a chi-square with r - 1
degrees of freedom. It follows that the minimized value of the second step
objective function can be used to test the nonlinear rational expectations model
(3.1). The particular r - 1 orthogonality conditions underlying this test are
determined by the choice of the matrix premultiplying gT(b) in (3.7), which in
turn was chosen to make bT "optimal." If one has a priori reasons for believing
that another set of r linear combinations of gT(b) should hold, then the
overidentifying restrictions associated with these conditions can also be tested
using the results from Hansen's [10] Lemma 4.1.
4. COMPARISON TO MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD

Amemiya [2] has noted in a somewhat different context that maximum
likelihood estimators will, in general, be asymptotically more efficient than
nonlinear instrumental variables procedures if the distributional assumptions are
specified correctly. On the other hand, maximum likelihood estimates may fail to
be consistent if the distribution of the observable variables is misspecified. In this
section we illustrate the second point in the context of the stock return model in
Section 2.
For the purposes of this illustration and the empirical example in Section 5, we
assume that preferences are of the constant relative risk averse type,

specification of the stock price model.
Maximum likelihood estimation requires that additional distributional assumptions be imposed on the model. Suppose that the stochastic process x' = (xl,
x2, ... ., xm,xk) is lognormally distributed, and that X= log x is stationary,

econometrician chooses to estimate a and ,Bin (4.1) using observations only on x

From the first-order conditions of the likelihood function, it can be seen that
the method of maximum likelihood implicitly uses the logarithmic orthogonality
conditions (4.7). The validity of these orthogonality conditions is crucially
dependent on x being lognormally distributed. For other distributional assumptions, the logarithmic form of the orthogonality conditions (4.7) will generally not
hold. Consequently, the maximum likelihood estimators of a and /B obtained
from (4.7) under the assumption of lognormality will generally not be consistent
if this distributional assumption is incorrect. In contrast, the procedures which
we proposed in Section 3 do not require that the distribution of x be specified a
priori and, in particular, they do not require that the logarithmic form of the
orthogonality conditions hold. Instead, we work directly with the orthogonality
conditions implied by (4.1).
5. EMPIRICALRESULTS

To illustrate the use of the generalized instrumental variables estimator, we
estimated the parameters of preferences, a and /3, for the model of stock prices
discussed in Section 4. Two different measures of consumption were considered:

nondurables plus services (NDS) and nondurables (ND)." The monthly, seasonally adjusted observations on aggregate real consumption of nondurables and
services were obtained from the Federal Reserve Board. Real per capita consumption series were constructed by dividing each observation of these series by
the corresponding observation on population, published by the Bureau of Census. Each measure of consumption was paired with three sets of stock returns:
the equally-weighted average return on all stocks listed on the New York Stock
Exchange (EWR), the value-weighted average of returns on the New York Stock
Exchange (VWR), and equally-weighted average returns on the stocks of three
two-digit SEC industries. The industries chosen were chemicals (SEC code 28),
transportation and equipment (SEC code 37), and other retail trade (SEC codes
50-52 and 54-59). The aggregate return data were obtained from the CRSP
tapes and the industry return data were obtained from Stambaugh [31]. Nominal
returns were converted to real returns, which appear in (4.1), by dividing by the
implicit deflator associated with the measure of consumption.
Following the notation adopted in Section 4, we let

and
h(xt+ I, bo) =

(X2t+ 1) aXlt+

I-1,

where bo = (a, /8). The vector of instruments zt was formed using lagged values
of Xt+1. For this specification of the process {(xt +I, zt); t = 1,2,.... }, the
stationarity assumption accommodates certain types of real growth in consumption. The number of lagged values of xt+ included in Zt, NLAG, was chosen to
be 1, 2, 4, or 6. As NLAG is increased, more orthogonality conditions are
employed in the estimation. Furthermore, the asymptotic covariance matrix
becomes smaller, and the number of overidentifying restrictions being tested
increases.12
Table I displays the parameter estimates obtained using the aggregate return
series for the period February, 1959 through December, 1978.
" Using a separation argument like that for labor supply discussed in note 4, it is possible to argue
that the restrictions hold for a measure of a subset of aggregate consumption. For instance, suppose
that Cl, and C2, are two different components of consumption at time period t and that the function
U is given by
U(Cl,,

C2t) = (CJ)

+ U2(C2t).

In this case, the restrictions we test are appropriate when Cl is used as the measure of consumption.
The two choices for C, considered correspond to two potentially different assumptions about the
separability of U.
12To be more precise, the asymptotic covariance matrix will not increase as more orthogonality
conditions are used. Using more orthogonality conditions may, at some point, lead to estimators with
less desirable small sample properties.

The estimates of a range from -.95 to -.68 when ND is used as the measure
of consumption, and from -.97 to -.82 when ND is used as the measure of
consumption. The estimated standard errors for a, SE(a), are smaller when
consumption is measured as ND than when consumption is measured as NDS.
As expected, all of the estimates of /8 exceed .99 but are less than unity. The
chi-square tests are also displayed in Table I, where the number of overidentifying restrictions is indicated by DF and Prob is the probability that a X2(DF)
random variate is less than the computed value of the test statistic under the
hypothesis that the restrictions (3.1) are satisfied. These tests provide greater
evidence against the model when EWR is included as the return, and when the
instrument vector is formed from a small number of lagged values of x.
For comparison, we present some results in Table II from estimating a and /3
using the method of maximum likelihood under the assumption that x is
lognormally distributed. They were obtained using the procedure described in
Section 4 assuming that log x has a sixth-order vector autoregressive representation. The corresponding estimates of a and P3from the two methods of estimation
are similar. However, the estimated standard errors of a and /3 from the
instrumental variables procedure are smaller than the corresponding standard
errors from the maximum likelihood procedure.'3 Three possible explanations for
this result are that the asymptotic standard errors are being estimated imprecisely, the economic model of stock returns is misspecified, or the auxiliary
assumptions underlying the maximum likelihood procedure are incorrect. The
maximum likelihood procedure assumes that x is lognormally distributed and
that the lag length specification of the vector autoregression is correct. Since the
13Analytical differentiation, as opposed to numerical differentiation, was used to calculate the
standard errors.

sum of lognormally distributed random variables is not lognormally distributed,
it seems implausible that both (and perhaps either) the value weighted and (or)
the equally weighted stock return indices are lognormally distributed. Also, the
lag length specification does not emerge from any theoretical consideration. The
generalized instrumental variables procedure does not require that either one of
these auxiliary assumptions be satisfied.14 On the other hand, the maximum
likelihood estimates provide a more complete characterization of the stochastic
process x when the lognormality and the lag length specifications are correct.
Table II also presents the likelihood ratio tests of the restrictions implied by
the lognormal version of the model, where the unrestricted model is an unrestricted sixth-order vector autoregression. In contrast to the instrumental variables results, the maximum likelihood results provide more evidence against the
restrictions when VWR is used than when EWR is used. For a more complete
description of the maximum likelihood estimation and a more comprehensive set
of results, see Hansen and Singleton [14].
If the Euler equation (4.1) holds for a given measure of consumption and all of
the stocks listed on the NYSE, then versions of (4.1) must also hold simultaneously for the equally- and value-weighted aggregate returns. In Table III we
present the results from estimating a and ,B using the orthogonality conditions
implied by the respective versions of (4.1) for EWR and VWR, with the z vector
formed using lagged values of EWR, VWR, and the consumption ratio. Note
that these estimates of a are smaller than the corresponding estimates in Table I.
Also, the estimated standard errors for at are smaller than the corresponding

14Another attractive feature of the generalized instrumental variables procedure is that it requires
a numerical search over a smaller parameter space than is required from the maximum likelihood
procedure.

estimates in Table I when consumption is measured as NDS, and they are
comparable for the models using ND.'5 Finally, there is considerably more
evidence against the models when the overidentifying restrictions associated with
EWR and VWR are tested simultaneously than when separate tests are conducted.
Table III also presents the results from estimating a and ,B using the three
industry-average returns simultaneously. In these cases, the coordinates of x,+1
are the three real stock returns and the consumption ratio, the Zt vector was
formed using lagged values of x + I, and the sample period was February, 1959
through December, 1977. The point estimates for a obtained using industry
returns are smaller than the corresponding estimates in Table I. At the same
time, the industry return data provides more evidence against the restrictions,
since the models with NLAG = 4 are rejected at the one per cent significance
level.
To summarize, all of the models considered yield economically plausible
estimates of a and /P.The test results for the single-return models are mixed, with
marginal confidence levels close to unity occurring for small values of NLAG
but not for large values. In contrast, the test statistics for the multiple-return
models all have probability values of .95 or larger, except one. Thus, the latter
results provide considerably more evidence against the stock pricing model with
constant relative risk averse preferences.
15One qualification to the four lag results in Table III should be mentioned. When NLAG = 4,
twenty-six and fifty-one orthogonality conditions are used to estimate the parameters a and /3 for the
aggregate and industry models, respectively. The quality of the consistent estimator of the weighting
matrix may deteriorate when the number of orthogonality conditions being used is large. In such
cases, one may wish to take the large sample approximations less seriously in evaluating the
parameter estimates and the restrictions implied by the model.

6. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have discussed a procedure for estimating the parameters of
nonlinear rational expectations models when only a subset of the economic
environment is explicitly specified a priori. We also described how to test the
over-identifying restrictions implied by the particular economic model being
estimated. The advantages of these procedures are that they circumvent the need
for explicitly deriving decision rules, and they do not require the specification of
the joint distribution function of the observable variables. The techniques are
appropriate for any dynamic model whose econometric implications can be cast
in terms of a set of orthogonality conditions. As an application of these
procedures, we estimated the parameters characterizing preferences in a model
relating the stochastic properties of aggregate consumption and stock market
returns.
