measures settings the loss of information can be quite significant, especially when the data on the covariates and outcome data prior to drop-out are highly predictive of Y.

Remark 2. If the data are MAR, then (3) reduces to the
weighted mean of the complete cases, where the weights
are estimates of the inverse probabilities of drop-out given
the covariates and outcomes prior to drop-out. This estimator is commonly applied to unit nonresponse in surveys

(Little and Rubin 1987, sec. 4.4) and is based on the ideas
underlying the Horvitz-Thompson estimate (Horvitz and
Thompson 1952). The method is also a weighting analog
of the multiple imputation method of Lavori, Dawson, and
Shera (1995), which is implemented in the first release of
SOLAS (Statistical Solutions, Inc. 1998). The incomplete
cases are used for bias adjustment but, as in the MCAR
case, are not used to predict missing values of Y. Thus,
whereas the SRR estimator is focused on bias reduction,
model-based approaches have the potential to reduce both
bias and variance, although they can be vulnerable to mis-

specification of the regression of the missing variables on
the observed outcomes and covariates.
Remark 3. If the data are not MAR, then the weights

in (3) are modified to yield consistent estimates under the
assumptions of (1). As in the MAR case, the information
in the incomplete cases is confined to bias adjustment, and

we suggest that (3) is inefficient when the outcomes observed prior to drop-out are good predictors of the missing outcomes, appeals to semiparametric efficiency bounds
notwithstanding.
