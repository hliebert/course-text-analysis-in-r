PANEL DATA FROM TIME SERIES OF CROSS-SECTIONS
Angus DEATON*

In many countries.
there are few or no panel data. but there exists a series of independent
cross-sections.
For example, in the United Kingdom,
there are no panel data on consumers’
expenditure
or on household labor supply, but there are several large household surveys carried out
every year. Samples for these surveys are drawn anew each year, so that it is impossible to track
individual households over time. This paper considers the possibility of tracking ‘cohorts’ through
such data. A ‘cohort’ is defined as a group with fixed membership,
individuals of which can be
identified as they show up in the surveys. The most obvious example is an age cohort. e.g. all males
born between 1945 and 1950, but there are other possibilities (Korean war veterans or founding
members of the Econometric
Society). Consider any economic relationship of interest that is linear
in parameters
(but not necessarily in variables). Corresponding
to individual behavior. them will
exist a cohort version of the relationship
of the same form. but with cohort means replacing
individual
observations.
If there are additive individual fixed effects, there will be corresponding
additive cohort fixed effects. Further, the sample cohort means from the surveys are consistent but
error-ridden
estimates of the true cohort means. Hence. provided errors-in-vanablcs
techniques are
used (and error variances and covariances can be estimated from the surveys), the sample cohort
means can be used as panel data for estimating the relationship.
Such data are immune to attrition
bias and can be extended for long time periods. There is also evidence to suggest that the errors in
variables problems may be Just as severe for genuine panel data; in the created panels considered
here, the problem is controllable.
The paper discusses appropriate
errors in variables estimators.
with and without fixed effects.

1. Introduction
In many countries, there are few or no panel data, but there exists a series of
independent
cross-sections.
For example, in the United Kingdom, there are no
panel data on consumers’ expenditure or on household labor supply, but there
are several large household surveys that are carried out every year. Samples for
these surveys are drawn anew each year, so that individual households cannot
be traced over time. This paper is concerned with the possibility of tracking
‘cohorts’ through such data. A ‘cohort’ is defined as a group with fixed
membership,
individuals
of which can be identified as they show up in the
surveys. The most obvious example is an age cohort, for example, all males
born between 1945 and 1950, but there are many other possibilities;
consider
Korean war veterans, or founder members of the Econometric
Society. For

Punel data from time series

of cross-sections

large enough cohorts, or large enough samples, successive surveys will generate
successive random samples of individuals
from each of the cohorts. Summary
statistics from these random samples generate a time series that can be used to
infer behavioral
relationships
for the cohort as a whole just as if panel data
were available.
Procedures for constructing
such cohorts and for estimation
using the resulting data are discussed in this paper.
I consider economic relationships
that are linear in parameters,
though not
necessarily
in data, and that may or may not contain individual
fixed effects.
Corresponding
to these individual
relationships,
there will exist averaged
versions of the same form for the cohort population,
but with unobservable
data points. If there are additive individual
fixed effects, there will be corresponding additive cohort fixed effects for the cohort population.
Furthermore,
the sample cohort means from the surveys are consistent
but error-ridden
estimates of the unobservable
cohort populations
means. Since the micro data
are used to construct the means, they can also be used to construct estimates of
the variances and covariances of the sample means. It is therefore possible to
use errors-in-variable
estimators to estimate consistently
the population
relationships.
Sections 3 and 4 of this paper derive appropriate
estimators in the
absence and in the presence of individual fixed effects.
Section 2, below, presents some of the models for which the technique is
designed
with particular
emphasis
on models of consumption
and labor
supply. I suggest that the estimation procedures discussed here may shed light
on some long-standing
puzzles in empirical demand analysis, and that they are
likely to be useful for the estimation
of life-cycle models in the absence of
panel data.
Although the methods discussed here are primarily formulated as a response
to the absence of panel data, it is not necessarily the case that they will give
inferior results. The attrition problem that effectively curtails the useful length
of much panel data is absent here. Because new samples are drawn each year,
representativeness
is constantly
maintained.
Indeed, to the extent that longrunning panels replace respondents
that drop out by ‘look alikes’, the resulting
data will have many of the features discussed here. Of course, the errorsin-variables
nature of the current methodology
is absent in genuine panel
studies, but I suspect that the difference is more apparent than real. Survey
statisticians
who collect panel data are in little doubt as to the magnitude
of
response error, particularly
in the differenced data for individual respondents.
And as Ashenfelter
(1983) has shown, it is extremely difficult to interpret the
diversity of labor supply elasticities obtainable
from the Michigan PSID data
(certainly the most heavily used panel data set among American economists),
without assigning a central role to large and persistent errors of measurement.
The technique
discussed here has the advantage of recognizing
measurement
error from the outset and explicitly controlling
for it.

111

2. Model formation
The models discussed in this section are of substantive
interest in their own
right and form the basis for current research using the methods discussed
below. The main purpose in presenting them here, however, is to motivate the
methodological
discussion in the following sections. Further, the provision of
concrete economic examples will justify some of the specific issues of estimation that are dealt with later.
In all of this work, my ultimate
aim has been to bring to bear the
methodology
of panel data on problems of consumer demand analysis. Even in
the United States, there is little panel information
on the details of consumer
expenditure,
and a few isolated examples apart, the same is true of the rest of
the world. For cross-sectional
consumer expenditure
surveys, however, most
countries
of the world are better supplied than is the United States, For
example, the British Family Expenditure
Survey is in continuous
operation and
surveys some 7000 households annually;
questions on income, labor supply.
and a very detailed disaggregation
of consumers’ expenditure
provide a mass
of high-quality
data. There are also many excellent series of household surveys
from LDC’s; India’s National
Sample Survey Office has run some twenty
nationwide
household
expenditure
surveys since independence,
and both
Indonesia and Sri Lanka have closely comparable household surveys for two or
more separate years. There is therefore a large potential for any method that
can ‘convert’ these data sets into panel data.
To illustrate
some of the more important
issues, consider the Engel curve
model,
qrhr =frh(%~

(1)

4,

for quantity
purchased
of good (or leisure) i by household
h in period t,
household
total outlay xhl, and vector of socio-economic
or demographic
characteristics
a,,,. A convenient
functional
form is provided by taking the
as dependent variable and writing
budget share W,hr = P,r%hr/Xhr

where

there are J socio-economic
characteristics,
(Y, /? and y are parameters,
represents
an
error
term.
Eq.
(2)
is
typically
estimated in one of two
and ‘,ht
derived forms. In the first, using a single cross-section,
the r subscript
is
dropped,
and systems of Engel curves are estimated.
In the second, the
equation is aggregated over h to give, for example,
fi,t = a, + P,logE,

+Ecy,,Lz/,

+ E,,,

(3)

A. Deaton, Panel data jrom

fltne senex of cross-sections

where iG1,, ii,, and Elt are weighted averages using xh/cxh
as weights, and 2,
is a representative
budget level defined by the aggregation
procedure
[see
Deaton
and Muellbauer
(1980) for a full discussion
of the model]. The
weighting procedure guarantees that G,, is the share of good i in the total of
consumers
expenditures,
and, provided the distribution
over households of x
does not change over time (as measured
by Theil’s entropy
measure of
inequality),
2, can be replaced by XI. Consequently,
apart from the substitution of demographics
for prices, neither of which explains very much in
aggregate, (3) is a conventional
aggregate demand system.
The point I want to emphasize is that the values of /3, estimated
from
cross-sections
tend to differ substantially
from those estimated
using time
series. Such contradictions
were first extensively
documented
by Kuznets
(1962), not only for aggregate consumption,
but also for the components
of
consumption.
It is widely known that savings ratios rise more in cross-sections
that in aggregate time series. It is less well-known that it is generally true that
total expenditure
elasticities for many commodities and groups of commodities
are further dispersed from unity when estimated on cross-sections
than when
estimated on time series. For example, the food share in England in 1955 was
almost identical to its value a century earlier in spite of a manyfold increase in
real income and in spite of the repeated confirmation
of Engel’s law in every
household
survey during that century; see Deaton (1975) Stone and Rowe
(1966) and Clark (1957) for further details. The presence of such phenomena
also poses problems
for forecasting demands in those situations where only
cross-sectional
data are available.
In terms of the foregoing model, goods are necessities if p, < 0, luxuries if
j3, ) 0, and neither if p, = 0. The Kuznets’ finding, so stylized, is that p, is
closer to zero in time series than in cross-sections.
Presumably, the problem lies
in inadequate
statistical control. Expenditure
differences between poor and
rich consumers
are not likely to be replicated by making a poor man rich
unless the poor and rich consumers
are otherwise identical. Controlling
for
even a long list of socio-economic
characteristics
is not satisfactory compared
with the opportunity
yielded only by panel data to use individuals as their own
controls. Recognizing
this, write (2) as

W,hr

=

a! + &logxht

+CYrlajhr

+ erh + Erhr3

(4)

for individual
fixed effect elh. Since, in general, 8,, will be correlated with the
other explanatory
variables, such an equation can only be consistently
estimated from panel data. Consider, however, the case where h is a member of a
well-defined
cohort group that can be tracked via its (randomly
chosen)
representatives
through successive surveys. Let h belong to a cohort c, and

rrt

to c to obtain

(5)

where asterisks denote population
(i.e., cohort population)
means. If it were
possible to observe the true cohort means, eq. (5) would hold for each cohort in
each time period rather than for each household in each time period. and could
be directly estimated using cohort dummy variables for the cohort fixed en‘ects
6,:. This would be feasible since each cohort appears in each time period; it is
of course infeasible
on the individual
model (4) since each individual
household appears only once. In practice, the other starred variables can only be
proxied by cohort means from the sample; these will contain sampling errors
and if used without appropriate
correction will generally lead to inconsistent
estimates
since the model is effectively one of errors in variables with all
variables (except dummies) subject to error. However, the sample can be used
in the standard way to derive estimates of sampling variances and covariances
and these estimates can be used to derive consistent estimators using more or
less standard errors in variables procedures;
see sections 3 and 4 below.
Two other features of eq. (5) should be noted. First, the total outlay variable
is the mean of the logarithms. not the logarithm of the means. There is no need
in this context to fudge the issue since the sample can be used just as easily to
estimate
the mean of a non-linear
function
as to estimate the non-linear
function of the mean. Second, it is usually possible to select cohorts that are
more or less broadly defined. Ultimately.
the cohort that is all inclusive is the
total population
and (5) becomes a macroeconomic
aggregate time-series
model. In consequence,
selection of cohort size allows us to move by degrees
from micro to macro data; this is ideal for detecting the roots of a contradiction between micro and macro results.
In the foregoing example, the formation of cohorts can be thought of as an
instrumentation
procedure that removes the inconsistencies
associated with the
fixed effects. In my second example. the cohort structure arises naturally out of
the formulation
of the problem. Consider an individual
household choosing
consumption
and labor supply in an intertemporal
setting to maximize the
expectation

where. as before, 4, includes leisure demands, U, is period r’s utility function,
W, is assets at t, y, is income, and ir+l is the money interest rate from t to
t+l.
In Browning, Deaton and Irish (1985) it is shown that the solution to this
problem
can
be straightforwardly
characterized
in terms
of Frisch
demand/supply
functions

the vector of which is the gradient with respect to P,~ of a period t ‘profit
function’ ~T,(T,, p,), a convex linearly homogeneous
function. The quantity
r,,
the period t price of utility, evolves stochastically
according to

E,{(l +i,+h’l;+~) =1/r,.
Once again, the discussion is more useful given a specific functional
form.
Browning.
Deaton and Irish show that the following is consistent
with the
theory:
q,[ = a,, + P,log

P,, + C%,

{

P,l/PJ1’2

- PJx~r.

This model is correct both under certainty and under uncertainty.
In the
former case, (9) holds without the expectation
operator so that r, is simply
proportional
to a discount factor II(l + i,) relative to some arbitrary date.
Re-introducing
the household
subscript
h, the certainty
version of (10) is
therefore
4 rhr = a,hr +

,&l”gdrr + bt,(

P,,/P,I)~‘~
- P,logrOh,

(11)

1’1

where r,,h is independent
both of time and the commodity under consideration
discounted
back to the arbitrary
data 0. It is therefore an
and P,, is P,,
individual
fixed effect which is essentially a sufficient statistic for the influence
of current and future values of assets, prices, interest rates, and wages; see
MaCurdy
(1981). Since r,, is the price of life-time utility to h, it is an
increasing
function
of life-time real wealth given concavity
of (6). Consequently rob will vary with h and thus with cohorts in the cohort version of (11).
Moreover, since younger cohorts are on average wealthier than older ones, we
should expect the cohort dummy variables to be monotonically
related to
cohort age. The cohort structure here not only has the advantage of linking
micro with macro. but also explicitly
recognizes
the life-cycle nature of
consumption
and labor supply. Indeed cohort methods have been widely used

A. Deuton, Panel datu fromtime senes oJcross-sections

in work with life-cycle models; see e.g. Ghez and Becker (1975) and Smith
(1977) though these authors work with single cross-sections
which lack the
panel element introduced
here.
Under uncertainty,
(9) can be written approximately
as

where P,, is the real commodity i rate of interest. Note that in this case, even if
the shocks to the system, u,, are stationary, log rt will be non-stationary,
so that
differencing
is required to obtain consistent estimates. In general, the u, can
only be guaranteed
to be mean stationary,
and further assumptions
will be
required
for the consistency
of techniques
applied to (13). Even so, the
differenced version is likely to be a better starting point for estimation than the
original version in levels once uncertainty
is taken into account. Once again,
the aggregation
to cohorts provides the repeated observations
necessary for
differencing,
while the microdata
provide the estimates
of cohort means
together
with their sampling
errors. The differenced
versions will have a
different
measurement
error structure
than the levels models, and this is
discussed below in sections 3 and 4. Note also that in (13) to the extent that
the current prices and interest rates contain relevant new information,
the
innovation
v,,, will be correlated with the explanatory variables necessitating
an
estimator than can deal with both errors of measurement
and simultaneity.
3. Estimation

of models in levels

Before presenting
the estimator to be discussed, consider an alternative, and
perhaps more obvious approach to the estimation of an equation like (4) of
section 2. To unify notation, rewrite this in standard form as
Yh,

=

Xhr-B

‘h

+

‘h,,

(14)

where the i subscript is no longer required, y,, is the dependent
variable for
individual
h at t, xhr is a vector of explanatory
variables, and 19, is the fixed
effect. Aggregate first over those h belonging to cohort c that happen to be
observed in the survey taken at t. We then get observed sample cohort means
which satisfy the relationship
(15)

116

A. De&on,

Note that c?~, is the average of the fixed effects for those members of c that
show up in the survey; unlike the unobserved
fixed effect for the cohort
population
mean, e,., say, e,, is not constant over time. Furthermore,
8, is
unobserved
and, in general, is correlated with the Xct. Hence, although (15)
may be useful for ‘signing’ the bias in regressing j,., on Xc,, it is not an
appropriate
basis for consistent estimation
any more than is (14), unless the
cohort sample sizes are so large that #,, is a very good approximation
for 0,. In
this case, (15) can be estimated by replacing e,., by dummy variables, one for
each cohort.
Consider, instead of (15) the cohort population version of (14). I write this

where y,‘; and x:~ are the unobservable
cohort population
means, and 8,. is the
cohort fixed effect. Since the population
belonging to the cohort is assumed to
be fixed through time, 8c is a constant for each c and can be replaced in (16)
by cohort dummies. The JJ~ and x,*, cannot be observed, but the cohort sample
means Jc, and Xcl are error-ridden
estimators, with variances that can also be
estimated from the micro survey data. Eq. (16) can then be estimated by errors
in variables techniques where all variables, except the dummies, are measured
subject to error.
Eq. (16) can now be written in convenient
standard form
y,* = XT. /3 +

E,,

(17)

where the cohorts and surveys have been ‘stacked’ into a single index t,
running from 1 to T where T is the product of the number of surveys and the
number of cohorts. The cohort dummies 0, have been absorbed into the XT’S;
there is no loss of generality since the dummies can be thought of as being
measured with an error that has zero mean and variance. To fix ideas, take the
British Family Expenditure
Survey as an illustration.
Currently,
there are
about ten years of data available, with about 7000 observations
per year. In
Browning, Deaton and Irish’s (1985) work on consumption
and labor supply,
various selection criteria (which are always likely to be present in one form or
another)
reduce this to between 2500 and 3000 observations,
which were
formed into sixteen cohorts of five-year age bands. Hence, T = 80, but the
cohorts, with a maximum size of 300, are not large enough for us to ignore the
sampling errors in estimating y!* and x7 by j, and X,. Since, in this context
(and in many others) there is a new survey every year, it is sensible to construct
estimators
that are consistent
as T tends to infinity;
with sixteen cohorts
T + 00 sixteen times faster than annual, and four times as fast as quarterly
time series data. The cohort size, however, is held fixed as T becomes large.

The error E, in (17) is assumed to be normal, independent
over t, and
homoskedastic;
if the cohorts are very different in size, this will require that
each observation
be weighted by the square root of the cohort size. I shall
assume this has been done as necessary. The model is completed by adding to
(17) the assumed measurement
structure. The cohort means, jr and X, are
observed;
dropping
the overbars - from now on these are the basic data - I
assume

Given the sampling structure, the normality does not seem to be an implausible assumption.
However, the error variances u,, will in general have to be
estimated
by their sample counterparts
s,, based on the micro survey data.
Note that, in estimating the u,,‘s, all T observations
can be pooled, so that, if
there are n,. observations
in each cohort, the sampling variance of s,, diminishes in proportion
to (Tn,)- ’ and that of 3, and X, as (n, ) ‘. The former
is (a) smaller, and (b) tends to zero as T + cc instead of remaining fixed, so
that it may be reasonable to assume that the u’s are known in carrying out the
estimation.
Nevertheless,
I shall derive formulae for both cases, when u,,,), u
and 2 are known, and when they are estimated by s,~~~.s and S.
The model is now in the form in which I can apply the results of Fuller
(1975,1981);
indeed, in the rest of this section, I essentially
repeat Fuller’s
(1975) formulae in the current context and notation. The interested reader is
referred to that paper for further details.
Assume that means have been removed from all data and let the sample
moments and cross-product
matrices of X and J be M, ,. m , , and t71,,, in an
obvious notation. Write u,’ for the variance of E, and Q for the moment matrix
of the unobservable
x,! ‘s. Hence
E(M,,)=L2+2=2,,,

The derivation
of the variance-covariance
matrix of /I*, the estimator using
the estimated error variances, requires only minor modification
of the above. I
assume that the estimates s,, of a,,, i, j = O,l,.. . , K, the dimension of x, are
based on UT degrees of freedom. If all cohorts are pooled in estimating
the

per cohort, but clearly other schemes
are possible. Some estimate of the variances and covariances of the s,, is also
required;
to focus attention
I shall use that derived from sampling under
normality.
Hence, I assume that s,, is consistent for u,,, and that asymptotically,

Note that if v is large, (41) reduces to (30), the case of known variances; this
latter is likely to be a formula that would normally be adequate in practice.
Eqs. (23) (24), (38) and (41) are the basic results of this section. I conclude
with four issues of practical importance.
First, the error variances uoO, u and Z:
will generally vary from survey to survey and cohort to cohort. Write a&,, u’
and 2 for the values at observation
t, so that (19) and (20) become
E(M,,)=Q+C,

(19’)

E(m,,.)=A@+C,

(20’)

where %,a are the mean values over the t observations.
The analysis then goes
through with uoo, u and JZ (or soo, s and S in the case of estimated variances)
replaced by their means. Given the nature of the variation
with t, an appropriate
variance-covariance
matrix for the <,‘s can be derived and substituted for V(s - ~$3) in (41). Second, it is necessary to allow for the presence
of some x variables that are measured without errors. For example, relationships like (5) of section 2 contain cohort dummies that are clearly error-free.
Other variables
may not be drawn from the surveys but from other data
sources; macroeconomic
variables that are the same for all cohorts but vary
with time (prices) are the obvious examples, and, exceptionally,
there may be
other relevant
data on the cohorts themselves.
One way to proceed is to
introduce
additional
error-free variables to the right-hand
side of (14) and to
track them through the analysis. This turns out to be equivalent to the simpler
(and intuitive)
procedure of setting the appropriate
elements of u and rows
and columns
of 2 to zero; the formulae
for /3, /3* and their asymptotic

variances then remain unchanged. Third, for the reasons discussed in section 2,
it may be necessary to recognize contemporaneous
correlations
between some
of the XT’S and Ed. Instrumental
variables will typically be available; in the
example of section 2, in the form of lagged cohort wages or prices. On the
assumption
that the instrument
vector wr is constructed
from a survey prior to
that used for x, so that their errors of measurement
are uncorrelated,
the
appropriate
instrumental
variable estimator is

firv=[w’x(ct/‘w- 72,,)--‘x’w]-‘[w’x(w’w-

T2J1W’y],
(43)

with a variance matrix calculable by the methods given above. If measurement
errors in W and X are correlated, the obvious additional
corrections can be
made. Fourth, and finally, note that there will typically be some flexibility in
constructing
cohorts. If cohorts are constructed
by age, the age bands can be
taken broad or narrow (e.g., a five-year window versus a one-year window),
and other qualifying
characteristics
can be left unspecified or tightly defined.
Clearly, the construction
of cohorts with members that are distinct from one
another
and internally
homogeneous
will minimize
the errors in variable
problem and enhance precision. Beyond that, it is possible to use trial cohorts
to estimate @ and its variance, and to use these consistent estimates to gauge
the consequences
of combining or separating cohorts.

4. Estimation

of models in differences

In this section, I develop the estimators appropriate
for the case where the
model, like the second model of section 2, requires differencing
prior to
estimation.
The previous results do not go through directly because the
measurement
errors induced by the sampling
scheme now have a MA(l)
structure relative to the unobservable
true first differences.
I now write the model in the form
Ay,* =A$

./3+~!,

for the true unobservable
ment structure is

first differences.

(44)

(46)

122

and

U,, =

u,, -

(48)

Uf-l,,

with u,~ and ut, the original
respectively.
The relationship

measurement
errors on the yI and x,, variables
between Ay, and AX, is therefore given by

Ay,=B.Ax,+(~~+u~~-B.i)t).

(49)

In passing note a tempting but ineffective possible route to estimation.
for
Consider
Nx, = x, + x,-i, the moving average, as a possible instrument
Ax,, the first-difference,
and for simplicity, assume x, is scalar. Since Nx, =
of u, = U, - u,+i, Nx, is
Nx,* + U, + u,_~, and since U, + u,-i is independent
orthogonal
to the compound
error in (49). However, in large samples Nx,
is also orthogonal
to the regressor Ax,; E(Nx; Ax,) = x7’ - xr*_2i, so that
E(T-‘ZNx;
Ax,) = T-‘(x;*
- xg2) with a limit as T + co of zero. In consequence, instrumental
variables estimation
of this type will not work. It is
therefore necessary to follow through a scheme similar to that of section 3.
To ease notation, write n, = A y, and z,, = Ax, so that, corresponding
to (19)
to (21) the moment matrices are now
E(M,,)=

W+22=ZZZ,

say,

(50)

E(m=,)=

Wb+2a=a,,,

say,

(51)

E(m,,)

= #l’Wp + ui + 2a,

= Us,,,

say,

(52)

where W is the sample moment matrix of the Ax: = z: variables. The doubled
role of measurement
error comes from the moving average errors in (47) and
(48). The first-difference
estimator, &, is immediately
given as

&=

(A4,,-22)-'(m,.-

2a),

(53)

or equivalently
&=(Z’Z-2TZ)-‘(Z’n-2Tu).

Expansion,

as in section

3, yields

The variance of this is tedious to calculate, particularly

The presence of W+ and W- reflects the autocorrelation
in the measurement
error. Comparing
with (29) and taking the case where W+= W-= 0, the
measurement
errors now play a much larger role in determining
the variance.
Put differently,
given the same amount of variance in the true unobservables
under levels and differences, estimation
precision will be lower in the latter
case. This result, which is not surprising,
can be enhanced
or modified by
positive or negative autocorrelation
in the true z,X series.
The asymptotic variance covariance matrix of j$ is obtained by substituting
(58) into (56). In practice, an estimation
formula can be obtained by noting
