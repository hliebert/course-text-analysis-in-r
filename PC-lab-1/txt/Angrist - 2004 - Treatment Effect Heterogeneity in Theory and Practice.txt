1. Causality and Potential Outcomes in Research on Childbearing

The effects of children on marital stability have long been of interest to soc
scientists and are of course of more than academic interest to many marr
couples. Previous research (Becker et al., 1977; Cherlin, 1977; Heaton, 1990 and
Waite and Lillard, 1991) suggests the presence of young children increases mar
stability, although many authors acknowledge serious selection problems that m
bias results. A related issue is the connection between childbearing and wome
standard of living. A large literature looks at the effect of teen childbearing
mothers' schooling, earnings, and welfare status, sometimes using instrumen
variables (Bronars and Grogger, 1994). Interest in this question can be motiva
by welfare reform, which includes 'family caps' in many US states. Family c
reduce or eliminate benefits paid for children born to welfare recipients, on t
theory that further childbearing by welfare mothers increases the likelihood t
will stay poor and therefore continue to receive benefits.2
Are children the glue that holds couples together or a burden that accelerate
fragile family's collapse? Does childbearing further impoverish poor wom

2 See Maynard et al. (1998) for more on the motivation for family caps. The possibility of a li
between childbearing and poverty notwithstanding, there is little evidence that family caps actu
affect fertility. See, e.g., Grogger and Bronars (2001), Blank (2002) or Kearney (2002).

Implicit in these questions is the notion of potentia

For both practical and substantive reasons, I focus h
defined with reference to the transition from two to more than two children. On

the practical side, instruments based on sibling sex composition are available
this fertility increment. Angrist and Evans (1998) used parents' preferences f

mixed sibling sex composition to estimate the labour supply consequence

childbearing. On the substantive side, post-war reductions in marital fertility
been concentrated in the 2-3 child range (Westhoff et al., 1963). While almost
couples want at least one child, the decision to have a third child may be du
part to a sense of whether this is good for long-term marital stability or, m
generally, the economic welfare of the family. Finally, interest in the 2-to-3
increment is supported by the fact that the population of welfare mothers in
had an average of about 2.3 children and a median of 2 children.
Since Yli and Yoi are never both observed for the same woman, research o

causal effects tries to capture the average difference in potential outcomes

different subpopulations. For example, we may be interested in
E (Y Yi - YoilDi = 1), which is the effect on women who have a third child. Note that

E(YliljD = 1) is an observable quantity, so estimating E(Yli - YoilDi = 1) is equivalent to estimating the counter-factual average, E( YoiDi = 1). Alternately, we may
be interested in the unconditional average treatment effect (ATE), E(Yli- Yoi),
which can be used to make predictive statements about the impact of childbearin
on a randomly chosen woman (or a woman with a particular set of characteristics
the analysis conditions on covariates). Estimation of ATE is equivalent to estim

tion of both counterfactual averages, E(YoiDi -- 1)and E(YlijDi = 0).
Causal parameters are easy to describe but hard to measure. The observed dif

ference in outcomes between those with Di = 1 and Di = 0 equals
E ( Yi - Yoi|Di = 1) plus a bias term:

E(YijDi = 1) - E( YiDi = 0) = E(YlijDi = 1) - E(YoilDi = 0)
= E(Yli - YoiDOi = 1)

+ [E(YoilDi = 1) - E(YoilDi = 0)]. (1)

The bias term disappears when childbearing is determined in a manner independent of a woman's potential outcomes. But this independence assumption seems
unrealistic since childbearing decisions are made in light of information about
family circumstances and earnings potential.

2. IV in Context

IV estimates capture the effect of treatment on the treated for those whose treatment

status can be changed by the instrument at hand. This idea is easiest to formalise
using a notation for potential treatment assignments that parallels the notation
for potential outcomes. In particular, let Doi and Dli denote potential treatment
assignments defined relative to a binary instrument. Suppose, for example, Di i
determined by a latent-index assignment mechanism,

Di = 1(0 + 71Zi > qi), (2)

where Zi is a binary instrument, and ti is a rand
instrument. Then the potential treatment assign

These assumptions capture the notion that the instrument is 'as good as randomly

i.e., the population for which Dli = 1 and Doi = 0.
A standard assumption invoked in most empirical
effects, i.e.,

Yli = Yoi + 0,

for some constant c. In the empirical study, below, this implies that IV
consistently estimates the common effect of childbearing on all women, since,
given constant effects, E(Yli - YoilDli > Doi) = o. The LATE result highlights the
fact that in a more realistic world where this effect varies (and indeed it must

vary if, for example, Yi is a binary outcome or other variable with limited
support), then we can be sure only that IV captures the effect on individuals
whose treatment status can be changed by manipulating Zi. These are people
with Dli = 1 and Doi = 0, or Dli - Doi = 1. Note also that since Dli and Doi are
defined with reference to a particular instrument, we should expect different
instruments to uncover different average causal effects. We might, for example,
expect an IV strategy based on the same sex instrument to identify a different
average effect from an instrument based on twin births. In fact, Angrist and
Evans (1998) report IV estimates using twin birth instruments that are much
lower than those using same sex instruments.

Angrist et al. (1996) refer to people with Dli - Doi = 1 as the population of
compliers. This terminology is motivated by an analogy to randomised trials where Zi
is a randomised offer of treatment and Di is actual treatment status. Since

D i - Doi = 1 implies Di = Zi, compliers are those who comply with an exper
menter's intended treatment status (though not all those with Di = Zi are com-

pliers, as explained below). For compliers, the averages of Yi1 and Yoi as well as th
average difference are also identified. In particular, Abadie (2002) shows that

E(YjDijZi = 1) - E(YYDilZi = 0)
E(DijZi = 1) - E(DijZi = 0)= E(YlijDni

> Doi) (3a)

E[Yi(1 - Di)lZi = 1] - E[Yj(1 - Di)|Zi = 0]
= E(Yoi|D1; > Doi). (3b)
E[(1 - Di) Zi = 1] - E[(1 - Di)|Zi = 0]

The entire (marginal) distributions of Yli and Yoi are similarly identified, a fac
used by Abadie et al. (2002) to estimate the causal effect of treatment on th
quantiles of potential outcomes for compliers.
An important econometric result in the theory of causal effects is that when

treatment is assigned by a mechanism like (2), population average treatmen

Proof of the LATE result: E(Yi|Zi = 1) = E[Yoi + (Yli - Yoi)DilZi = 1], which equal

E[Yoi + (Yli - Yoi)Dli] by independence. Likewise E(Yi|Zi = 0) = E[Yoi + (Yli- Yoi)Doi], so the Wald

numerator is E[(Y1i- Yoi)(DIi-Doi)]. Monotonicity means Dli-Doi equals one or zero, s

E[(Yli - Yoi)(Di - Doi)] = E(Yli - Yoil|Di > Doi)P(Dli > Doi). A similar argument shows E(DiZiZ = 1)
E(Di|Zi
= 0) = E(Di, - Doi) = P(Dli > Doi).

heterogeneity, however, I briefly explore the relationship between LATE, A
and effects on the treated in a parametric model that mimics the same sex s

2.1. A Parametric Example

Following Heckman et al. (2001), I calculated average causal effects using a t
riate Normal model for the joint distribution of potential outcomes and the
term in the latent-index assignment mechanism given by (2). Assuming th
tribution of (Yli Yoi qi)' is joint standard Normal, ATE is zero by construct
Assume also that 71 > 0 so monotonicity is satisfied with D1,i 2 Doi and let plo be

written:

E(Yli - YoilDli > Doi) = E(Yli- YoilYo + 71 > rli > To)

= Plo{[R(Yo) - P(0o+1)][(Y0 o+-y) - ((y)]-'}, (4)

where 9p() and D(-) are the Normal density and distribution functions. Similarly,
we can use Normality to write the effect on the treated as:

E(Yi - YoiDi = 1) = E[E(Yli - Yoil70 + YiZi > qi, Zi)|Di = 1]

= -Pio{(TYo + 71)E(ZilDi = 1)

+ 2(To0)[1 - E(Zi Di = 1)]}. (5)

where (') is the inverse Mill's ratio, c(-)/(I(-). This formula is us

calculation, but the following expression better clarifies the difference
LATE and the effect on the treated:

E(Yi - Yoi|Di = 1) = E(Yi - Yol o + 71 > qi > Yo)@ + E(Yi - Yoillo > ri)(1
(6)
where w= [@((70+ 1) - (0yo)] [P(Zi= 1)/P(Di= 1)] and 1i - = F(7yo)/P(Di= 1).

Equation (6) shows the effect on the treated to be a weighted average of LATE and

the average effect on those with 70 > ji, with weights that depend on the first stage
and the distribution of Zi.

the size of the first stage effect from 0.07 to 0.30 pulls both LATE and the effec

The effect of treatment on the treated is above LATE for all first-stage b

values, a consequence of the fact that selection on gains makes E(Yli - Yoi0y
bigger than LATE. Moreover, LATE provides a better measure of the effec
treatment on a randomly chosen individual (ATE) than does the effect on

Equation (7) generalises (6), which gives the sa

E ( Y - YoijDi = 1) is not.
To pinpoint the identification challenge in this context further, note that
E( YlijDo0 =- Di = 1) and E( Yoi|Doi = Di = 0) can be estimated using the following

relations:

E(YIiDoi = Diz = 1) = E(Y1i|Doi = 1) = E(YjiDi = 1, Zi = 0) (8a)
E(YoilDoi = Dli = 0) = E(YoilDli = 0) = E(Yi|Di = 0, Zi = 1). (8b)
The missing pieces of the identification puzzle are therefore the fully counterfactual averages, E(YlijDoi = Dli = 0) and E(Yoi|Doi = DO i = 1).

The conditional expectation functions (CEFs) of Yli and Yoi given potential

E(YoilDoi, Dli) = to + fooDoi + l0Dli. (9b)

Equations (9a) and (9b) impose no restrictions since there are three potential
assignment subpopulations and three parameters in each CEF. The 6 conditional
means, E(1YjiD0i, Dli), are uniquely determined by (9a,b) as follows:

THEOREM. Suppose the Independence, First-Stage, and

and that Yoi and Y1i have multinomial distributions. Let
denote the conditional distribution functions for potentia
ments and let fyDZ(y, d, z) denote the joint distribution of
and fi (y |DiD, Doi) are not identified from fYDz(y, d, z).

Proof Factor the d.f. using fyDZ(y, d, z) = fYDZ(Y

term is unrestricted. Let

f(ylDli, Doi) = aj (y) + fjo(y)Doi + #jl(y)Dli,

substitute into fyDz(y, d, z), and iterate expectations to obtain the multinom

likelihood solely as a function of the parameters determining fo(yIDli,Doi) an
fi (yIDli, Doi). Finally, substitute for fo(ylDli, Doi) and fi (ylDli, Doi) to show
likelihood is invariant to the choice of #Foo(y) and ,ll (y) as long as c (y) + #ll(y
constant. Non-identification of oo0(y) implies non-identification of the margin
distribution of Yoi while non-identification of #11 (y) implies non-identification
the marginal distribution of Y1i.
The multinomial distributional assumption raises the question of how gener
the theorem is. It seems general enough for practical purposes since, as noted b
Chamberlain (1987), any distribution can be approximated arbitrarily well by
multinomial. Moreover, I would like to rule out identification based on

continuity or support conditions to avoid paradoxes such as 'identificati
infinity'.6

3.2. A Menu of Restrictions

A variety of restrictions on (9a,b) are sufficient to identify ATE. I briefly discuss
four cases that strike me as being of special interest. The simplest is ignorable
treatment assignment or 'no selection bias.'
RESTRICTION 1 (No Selection Bias).

Pfl0 = 01 - 10 11 = 0.
This implies LATE = al - Lo = ATE. Under Restriction 1, ATE can be estimated
from simple treatment-control comparisons.
Because the assumption of no selection bias involves four restrictions while two
would be sufficient, ATE is over-identified in this case.7 A standard Hausman
(1978) test for endogeneity exploits over-identification by comparing IV and OLS

estimates, equivalent here to a comparison of Wald estimates with simple
6 See Chamberlain (1986). The multinomial assumption has some content since it implies that

potential outcomes have bounded support, so that ATE and effects on the treated are bounded. See
Manski (1990) or Heckman and Vytlacil (2000).
7 A weaker version of Restriction 1 with fl# = foo = 0 is also sufficient to identify ATE since this
equates never-takers with compliers for the CEF of Yli and always-takers with compliers for the CEF of
Yoi. This seems no easier to motivate than Restriction 1, so I limit the discussion to the over-identified
case.

treatment-control differences. A modified and

be based on the fact that under Restriction 1, E(YjilDoi= 1) = al and
E(Yoi|Dli=- 0) = o. Using (8a,b), this suggests the following specification test:
Test for Selection Bias.

E(Yi|Zi = 1) - E(YOIZi = 0)
= 1, Zi = 0) - E(YilDi = 0, Zi = 1)]. (T1)
E(DilZiE(Yi1Zi1)-=
= 1) - E(DilZi[E(Yi|Di
= 0)
In the Appendix, I show how a test statistic based on T1 can be computed using
regression software.

The Hausman test for selection bias replaces E(YilDi = 1, Zi = 0) - E(YilDi = 0,

Zi = 1) on the right hand side of T1 with E(YilDi = 1) - E(YilDi = 0). The

Hausman test will also work in the causal framework outlined here since under

Restriction 1 both OLS and IV estimate ATE. The difference between Ti and a

Hausman test arises from the fact that the Hausman test implicitly comp

E(YjilDli> Doi) with E(Yji]Di=j) for j= 0,1, while Ti implicitly com

E(YjilDli > Doi) with E(YjilDi = Doi = j) for j = 0,1. These two pairs of co
sons are the same under monotonicity but not in general. The empirical r

below suggest that Ti, which uses monotonicity, indeed provides a more po
specification test.8

While pivotal for specification testing, the assumption of no selection bia

possibility of selection bias. An alternative assumption that allows for selecti
amounts to the claim that the difference between Yli and Yoi is mean-indep
of potential treatment assignments. I refer to this as 'conditional constant e
Formally, this means:

RESTRICTION 2 (Conditional Constant Effects).

l00 = #10; o01 = #11

This pair of restrictions is just sufficient to identify ATE. In particular, w

have LATE = a - ao = ATE, or, equivalently, E(Yli - YoilDli, Doi) = E(Yli

While Restriction 2 allows for selection bias in the sense that Yli and Yoi are

correlated with potential treatment assignments, the correlation is restricted to be
the same for both potential outcomes, so that the difference between Yli and Yoi is
orthogonal to potential treatment assignments.
In the same sex example, Restriction 2 amounts to saying that average treatment
effects, while not constant, are nevertheless the same regardless of a woman's
likelihood of having children. Restriction 2 rules out Roy (1951) type selection,
where treatment status is determined at least in part by the gains from treatment.
In the case of childbearing, for example, a woman's childbearing decision must be
independent of individual-level variation in the labour-supply consequences of
childbearing. On the plus side, Restriction 2 is weaker than the usual constant-

effects assumption in that it does not require a det
Yoi.9

A third restriction, which I call 'linearity', is appealing because it is not fundamentally inconsistent with a benchmark Roy-type selection model. The linearity
condition is:

RESTRICTION 3 (Linearity).

floo0 = 01; flio = fill

In this case, the potential-outcomes CEFs can be written:

E( YiJDoi, Dli) = oq + ,, (Doi + Dli) (10a)
E(YoiJDoi, D1i) -= o + flol(Doi + Di). (10b)
Restriction 3 requires the potential-outcomes CEF to be linear in D =_ Doi + Dli,
where D* is a summary measure of the desire or suitability of an individual for
treatment. If the restriction is false, we can nevertheless think of (10a) and (10b) as
providing a minimum mean-squared error approximation to the unrestricted
model, (9a) and (9b).
To see how average causal effects are identified under Restriction 3, write the
probabilities of being an always-taker and never-taker as

P(Doi = Di = 1) = E(Doi) = Pa
P(Doi = Dli = 0) = E(1 - Dli) = Pn
and note that

E(Doi + Di) = 1 + (Pa - Pn).
Substitute into (10a) and (10b) and difference to obtain

E(Y - Yoi) = [(a + fill) - (to + l0)] + (P11 - f01)(Pa - Pn)
= E( Yi - YoilDli > Doi) + {[E(YilDo0i = 1) - E(YliIDli > Doi)]

-[E(YoilDi > Doi) - E(YoilDli = 0)]}(pa - Pn). (11)
The components on the right hand side of (11) are easily estimated; details are
given in the Appendix.
A calculation similar to that used to derive (11) shows that the effect of treatment on the treated can be constructed using

E(Yli - YoilDi = 1) = [(a + /11) - (to + 01)] + (fil - l01)(Pa/Pd)
= E(Yli - YoilDli > Doi)
+ {[E(Yi|Do0i = 1) - E(Yli|Dl > Doi)]

-[E(Yoi|Dli > Doi) - E(YoiDli = O)]}(pa/pd), (12)
9 Note that the first part of Restriction 2 is sufficient to identify the effect of treatment on the treated,

while the second part is sufficient to identify the effect of treatment on the non-treated. Although
conditional constant effects is the basis of much empirical work and may be a reasonable approximation
for practical purposes, as a theoretical matter this is typically implausible unless treatment is exogenous;
see, e.g., Wooldridge (1997, 2003).

3.3. Symmetry Revisited

Restriction 3 is closely related to the symmetr

metric example. To see this, note that as a c

interpolate the CEF for compliers by averaging

E(YjiDli > Doi) = [E(YjilDoi = 1) +

This means that expected outcomes for compli
of expected outcomes for always and never-take
support a relation like (13)? Suppose treatment
assignment mechanism, as in (2). Then,

E(YjiDli = Doi = 0) = E(Yjiqli > 7o +

E(YjilDli - Doi = 1) = E(Yjili < Yo),
and

E(YjiDli > Doi) = E(YjiY t- + 1 > Gi > Yo).
If in addition, y, = -2o0, then (13) holds as long as (Yji, qi) is jointly symmetric,
as in the Normal model. The restriction y, = -270 implies

P(Di = I|Zi = 0) = P(qi < 70) = 1 - p (14)
P(Di = llZi = 1) = P(ji < -Yo) = P
for some p E (0,1) so the first stage is also symmetric (e.g, a first stage effect of

that shifts the probability of treatment from 1 - p = 0.45 to p = 0.55).
The upshot of the previous discussion is that a symmetric latent error distr
tion and a symmetric first stage imply the interpolating property, (13), or, e
alently, Restriction 3. Moreover, we again have LATE equals ATE since pa =
given the first stage described in (14).11 Intuitively, a symmetric first-stage
symmetrically distributed latent errors equates LATE with ATE because ave

treatment effects for individuals with characteristics that place them in the midd

of the qi distribution (compliers) are representative of average treatment eff
for individuals over the entire distribution of ~i.
A first-stage relationship may be fortuitously symmetric, as for the 1990 C
sample of teen mothers using the same sex instrument. In such cases, it see
10 With no always-takers, we have Doi - 0, so Restriction 3 is not binding.

11 To see this, note that P(Di = 1|Zi = 0) 1 - p implies Pa = 1 - p. Since pa + pn + [P(Di =
1) - P(Di = l1Zi = 0)] = (1 - p) + p, + (2p - 1) = 1, this implies p, = 1 - p. As noted in the di

sion of the parametric model, LATE = ATE given (14) also results when E(Yjilri) is an odd functi

the marginal distribution of qi, is symmetric. This makes it possible to have a relation like (13) with,
binary or otherwise limited dependent variable for which a symmetric distribution is implausible.

3.4. Weakening Restriction 3

Suppose again that treatment assignment can be mod
the potential-outcomes CEFs are linear in qi (as would
Normality). Then we can write,

E(YlilDoi, Dii) = x1 + pE((rllDoi

E(YoilDoi, Dli) = oo + PoE(jilDo
where

E(qriDoi, Dli) = E(qlDli = 0) + [E(qilDoi = 1) - E(rliDli = 1, Doi = 0)]Doi

+ [E(lilDli = 1, Doi = 0) - E(qlDli- = 0)]Dli. (16)

Substituting (16) into (15a) and (15b) generates an expression for the coefficie
in (9a), (9b). This leads to the following generalisation of Restriction 3:
RESTRICTION 4 (Proportionality).

floo 001o; fho = 0111, for 0 > 0.

The first part of the proportionality restriction comes from (15 a,b) alone. U
(16), we have

[E(iJDoi = 1) - E(qliDli 1, Dli = 0)]
[E(rlDli = 1, Doi = 0) - E(qrlDli = 0)]'
which shows why 0 is positive.

Restriction 4 leads to a generalisation of the interpolation formula for aver
potential outcomes. In particular, we now have

E(YjilDai > Doi) = [1/(1 + O)]E(YjilDoi = 1) + [8/(1 + 8)]E(Yji Dli = 0), (1

so that if 8 = 0, compliers have the same expected potential outcomes as alw
takers, while as 8 approaches infinity, compliers have the same expected pote
outcomes as never-takers.

4. Childbearing, Marital Status, and Economic W

The same sex instrument is a dummy for having two

second birth. Angrist and Evans (1998) showed th

likelihood mothers with at least two children go on
6-7 percentage points but is otherwise uncorrelated

characteristics. The data set used here is the 1990 Census extract used in the

Angrist and Evans paper. This sample includes mothers aged 21-35 with tw
more children, the oldest of whom was less than 18 at the time of the Census.

Descriptive statistics are reported in Table 1 for the full sample, for a subsample
of ever-married women and for four subsamples defined by mothers' education
and age at first birth. The division into subsamples was motivated by earlier results
showing markedly different effects of childbearing by maternal education and
because of the policy interest in teen mothers. The probability of having a third
child ranges from a low of 0.33 in the sample of women with some college, to a
high of 0.5 in the sample of teen mothers. The probability of having a same-sex
sibling pair is more or less constant at 0.505. Some of the estimates control for the
demographic covariates listed in Table 1 using linear models.14 Means for the
outcome variables of interest appear at the bottom of Table 1.
4.1. OLS, IV, and 2SLS Estimates
The effect of same sex on the probability of having a third child varies from a low of

5.9 percentage points in the some-college sample to a high of 6.5 percentages
points in the no-college sample. This can be seen in the first row of Table 2,
which reports first-stage estimates. The first-stage effect without covariates,
E(DniZi - 1) - E(DilZi = 0) = E(Dli - Doi), is also an estimate of the proportion
of the population in the compliers group.15 As a benchmark, the next two rows of
14 See Abadie (2003) and Frolich (2002) for nonlinear causal models with covariates.
15 Although we cannot identify individual compliers in any sample and tabulate their characteristics
directly, it is possible to describe the distribution of complier characteristics and to compare this to the
unconditional distribution. In particular, the difference in first-stage estimates across samples defined
by covariates characterises the distribution of covariates among compliers. To see this, note that for a

binary covariate,xi, E(xijDi > Doi)/E(xi) = E(D1i - Doijxi - 1)/E(Dli - Doi). Table 2 therefore also

shows same sex compliers to be less educated and more likely to have been married than the overall
average.

the sample of all women, those with more children are less likely to be married
But this is at least in part due to uncontrolled demographic factors such as age a
first birth, since OLS estimates with controls show that additional childbearing
associated with an increase in the likelihood of being married. In contrast to the
OLS estimates, IV estimates with or without covariates suggest that the causal effect

of childbearing is a reduced probability of being married. Thus, an important

finding is that when the effect of childbearing is estimated in models wit

demographic controls, IV and OLS estimates have opposite signs.
The most important change in marital status caused by childbearing appears to
be an increase in the likelihood of being divorced or separated. The estimat
effects of childbearing on the probability of being ever-married or divorced (bu
not separated) are not significantly different from zero. Consistent with an in

crease in marital breakup, the birth of a third child also appears to lead to

marked increase in the likelihood a woman lives in a family with total family
income below the poverty line. Here we should expect at least a mechanical effec
since the poverty threshold falls as family size increases. Although OLS estimate
are larger than IV estimates in models without covariates, OLS and IV estimates
models with covariates both indicate that a third child increases the likelihood a

woman is poor by 9-10 percentage points.

appear to be caused by childbearing, it seems reasonable to expect that the bi

a third child also increases the likelihood a woman is on welfare. Both the IV and

OLS estimates tend to support this, though the IV estimates are imprecise.

OLS estimate of the effect on welfare use range from 6.7 percentage p

without covariates to 3.9 percentage points with covariates. The IV estimat
marginally significant 3.3% with or without covariates. While small in lev
effect of this magnitude represents a roughly one-third increase in the num
women on welfare.

The IV estimates show no relationship between childbearing and the probabili
a woman has ever been married, so estimates limited to the sample of ever-marr
women are unlikely to be affected by selection bias. Not surprisingly, therefore, the
IV estimates in the sample of ever-married women are almost identical to those
the full sample. On the other hand, while the IV estimate of the reduction in
marriage rates is a significant 8 percentage points (s.e. = 0.028) for women wi
no college, it is close to zero and insignificant for women with some college. Th
effects of childbearing on poverty are also larger in the no-college sample, thou
the difference in effects on welfare use by college status is reversed and mu
smaller than the difference in effects on poverty rates.
The difference in estimates by mothers' age at first birth also suggest a pattern o
larger effects with decreasing socioeconomic status, though the contrast is not
clear cut as the differences by schooling group. While the increases in marita
dissolution and welfare receipt are larger for teen mothers than for adult mothers,
the estimates are significant only in the latter group. Estimates of effects on
vorce/separation are similar in the two groups, though again much more precis
for the sample of adult mothers. This difference in precision undoubtedly refle
the smaller sample of teen mothers. One clear contrast, however, is the high
likelihood that a third birth pushes a teen mother into poverty. The impact o
poverty status is significant regardless of mothers' age at first birth but it is rough
three times larger for teen mothers.

4.2. Heterogeneity across Potential-assignment Subpopulations

The first-stage estimates imply that 6-7% of each sample consists of compliers, i
mothers who had a child in response to a homogenous sibling-sex mix. Becaus
the overall probability of treatment ranges upwards from about 0.32, the ove
whelming majority of treated individuals are always-takers. This can be seen
Table 4, which gives the distribution of potential-assignment subpopulations.
the sample of all women, for example, 6.3% are compliers, 34% are always-take
(i.e., have a third child without regard to sibling-sex composition) and 59% ar
never-takers (i.e., would never have a third child regardless of sibling-sex comp
sition). The proportion of treated who are compliers is 1 - (pa/Pd), or about 8
Given the relatively small proportion of compliers, the scope for differences

4.2.1. Symmetric subpopulations

The value of zero for (Pa - Pn) in the teen mother sample is noteworthy because it
means that LATE is the same as ATE under Restriction 3. This is a consequence of
the fact that the first stage for teen mothers is almost perfectly symmetric: the same

sex instrument shifts the probability of further childbearing from about 0.47 to
0.53. Moreover, because 0 for teen mothers is about 1 when estimated using (20),
estimates of ATE for teen mothers under Restriction 4 are also close to LATE.

The first two columns of Table 5 focus on the comparison between estimates for
all women and teen mothers only, repeating earlier estimates for these samples
from Table 3 without covariates, including the first-stage coefficient and intercept.
For the most part, IV estimates for teen mothers are similar to those for the sample

of all women. While the estimated effect on employment is considerably lower at
-0.026 (s.e. = 0.051) versus -0.084 (s.e. = 0.027) in the full sample, the effect of

childbearing on weeks worked is -5.2 (s.e. = 1.3) in the full sample and -4.8
(s.e. = 2.4) for teen mothers. Similarly, the effect on marital status is -0.062
(s.e. 0.024) in the full sample and -0.066 for teen mothers (0.051). Note that we

can view the parameters estimated in the full sample as estimates of
E (Yi - YoilDli > Doi, X = all women), while the estimates in column 2, for teen
mothers, can be interpreted as measuring E (Yli- YoilX= teen mothers) under
Restriction 3 or 4. A test of equality across columns 1 and 2 is therefore ajoint test
of the invariance of average treatment effects to conditioning both on X and on
the compliers potential-outcomes subpopulation. The fact that these are similar is

evidence against substantial treatment effect heterogeneity in both dimension
though of course there are scenarios where this test has no power.16
There is some evidence for a difference in effects on poverty status between t

teen mother and all-women samples. For all women, the IV estimate of the effect of

childbearing on poverty status is 0.095 (s.e. = 0.023), while the correspondi
estimate is 0.143 (s.e. = 0.05) in the teen mother sample. The comparison acros

samples is weakened, however, by the fact the estimates in the teen mother sam
are much less precise than in the full sample. This raises the question of wheth
we can construct a larger sample with a symmetric first stage. I attempted to
construct such a sample by estimating a Probit first-stage allowing interactions with
covariates and then selecting the sample based on covariate-specific fitted values

16 As with an over-identification test, the power of the test turns on maintaining the validity o
benchmark. Here, we maintain E(Yli- YoilX = teen mothers) = E(Yi - Yoi).

17 A maintained assumption here is that the distribution of Yji and ri is jointly symmetric conditio
on the covariates used to select the sample with a symmetric first stage.

The details of the symmetric sample selection are as foll
parametric model to capture the variation in the first-sta
childbearing with demographic covariates. The model all
interaction terms with covariates. I then look for covaria

dicted first-stage effect is symmetric in the sense required b
with a Probit first-stage equation:

P(D-i = 1|Zi, Xi) = D[K'Xi + (K' Xi)Zi], (21)
where Xi is a vector of covariates that includes age, age at first birth, Black and
Hispanic dummies, and dummies indicating women with some college and college
graduates. The main effects, iK'Xi, and interaction terms, K'1Xi, use the same
parameterisation of covariate effects (in particular, they both allow for linear terms

in the age variables plus main effects for the dummies). In practice, K'oXi takes on
about 1,700 distinct values. For each of these values, I calculated

ro(Xi) -- I(c'Xi),
the distribution of which is plotted in Figure 3. This gives the distribution of the
probability of childbearing for women with different X-characteristics and Zi equal

to zero, i.e. the probability of being an always-taker. The distribution of ito(Xi) is

concentrated around the overall average of about 0.34, though there is
considerable spread.
By definition, a symmetric first stage shifts the probability of treatment across
the value of one-half. To identify a sample where this is most likely, I initially
selected women with it7(Xi) between 0.4 and 0.6. Column 3 of Table 5 reports
estimates for this sample, which has about 104,000 observations. The estimated
first-stage in this sample shifts the probability of treatment from 0.47 to 0.54, i.e.,
approximately from p to 1 - p, as required by symmetry. For most outcomes, the IV

estimates in this symmetric sample are smaller in absolute value than in the full
sample and smaller than in the sample complementary to the symmetric sample,
for which results are reported in column 4. For example, the estimated effect on

weeks worked in the symmetric sample is -3.7 (s.e. = 2.2), while the corresponding estimate in the complementary sample is -6 (s.e. = 1.6). Again, however,
the comparison is handicapped by a lack of precision.
The long right tail of the distribution of first-stage base values plotted in
Figure 3 suggests that an even larger symmetric sample can be constructed simply
by dropping values of 7o(Xi) beginning from the left and working up. As it turns
out, limiting the sample to individuals with values of ~t0(Xi) greater than or equal
to 0.35 leads to a first stage that shifts the probability of treatment from 0.465 to
0.533, virtually perfectly symmetric. This can be seen in column 5 of Table 5, which

reports first-stage and IV estimates for the resulting sample of 162,264 observations. Most of the estimates in this symmetric sample are close to those in the full
sample. For example, the effect on weeks worked is -5.9 (s.e. = 1.8) and the effect
on divorce or separation is 0.068 (s.e. = 0.032). Perhaps surprisingly, the estimated effect on poverty status differs markedly between this sample and its complement (0.136 versus 0.048) but the estimated effect is still significantly different
from zero in the complementary sample.

LATE. Again, this is partly a problem of precision. But the estimates of
outside the teen mother sample move substantially closer to zero than the es
mates of LATE. For example, while LATE suggests the probability of divorce
separation increases by 0.053 (s.e. = 0.019), the corresponding estimates of AT

are 0.028 (s.e. = 0.019) when 0 equals one and 0.009 (s.e. = 0.021) when 0

2004] TREATMENT EFFECT HETEROGENEITY C81

Y = 60 + 61[1(D = Z)] + 62[(D - Z)/2] + v. (A2)

The test for selection bias is a test of whether A1 = 62 when (Al) is estimated b
as an instrument and (A2) is estimated by OLS. The two coefficients and the
standard error for their difference can be estimated by stacking (Al) and (A2)
for heteroscedastic and correlated residuals. In practice, for sample sizes on
that used here, it seems reasonable to treat the estimate of 62 as non-stochastic
standard error of the estimate of A1 to construct a t-test.

2. Estimates under Restriction 3

Use (A2) to write:

E(YaID = 1, Z = 0) = E(YIID1 = Do = 1) = 60 + 62/2
E(Yo0D = 0, Z = 1) = E(Y ID1 = Do = 0) = 60 - 62/2.
Estimates of E(YoIDI > Do) and E(Y1ID1 > Do) can be obtained as IV estimates of the
coefficients A01 and All in (A3) and (A4), below:

DY = A10o + A1lD + 1 (A3)
(1 - D)Y = Aoo + Aol (1 - D) + 10. (A4)

Estimates of ATE under Restriction 3 are a linear combination of 60, 62,
coefficients and the standard error for any linear combination of them

stacking (A2), (A3), and (A4).
To further simplify, rewrite (11) in terms of the parameters in (A2

E( Y - Yo) = AI[1 - (Pa- Pn)] - Ao [ + (pa -pn)] + 26o

To accommodate models with covariates, it is convenient to use a regress

Pa - pn. Define a dependent variable d* = D(2Z - 1) - Z. Regress d on Z;
is an estimate of Pa - p,. Note that (without covariates) the standard erro
Pa - Pn is the same as the standard error for the first-stage coefficient

written 1 - p, - pa. To estimate E(Y1 - YoJD = 1), replace Pa - Pn with
Models with covariates were estimated by adding covariates to the r
equations, and to (A1)-(A4). As a shortcut for inference for estimates
seems reasonable to treat (pa - pn) and 60 as known since these are es
precisely than All and A01, which are themselves instrumental variable
that IV estimates of All and A01 are independent.

3. Estimates under Restriction 4

Substitute parameters from (Al)-(A4) into (19) and simplify to obtain
E(Yi - Yo0) = All[ - (Pa - 0-'pn)] - A0o [1 + (OPa - Pn)]

+ [60(1 + 8-1) + (62/2)(8-1 - 1)](8pa - p,).
Standard errors were calculated treating pa, Pn, 60, 62, and 8 as known.
