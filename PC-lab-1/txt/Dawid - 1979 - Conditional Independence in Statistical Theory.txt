1. INTRODUCTION
INDEPENDENCE

wheretheyformthe basis of severalareas of study,such as limittheoremsand Markov
chains. It is the aim of this paper to show that independenceand (more particularly)
in thetheoryof statisticalinference.
conditionalindependenceare equallyfundamental
It transpiresthat many of the importantconceptsof statistics(sufficiency,
ancillarity,
etc.) can be regardedas expressionsof conditionalindependence,and thatmanyresultsand
theoremsconcerningtheseconceptsare just applicationsof some simplegeneralproperties
of conditionalindependence.By takingconditionalindependenceas basic, and expressing
in termsofit,we achievea unification

The above claimis a big one, and the readermustdetermine

it is substantiated
by thispaper. My plan has been to take severalareas of statistics,
express
themin termsofconditionalindependence
and examinetheconsequencesofthispointofview.
Most (thoughnot all) of the resultsare well known,but have not beforebeen considered
fromthisangle. (Notable exceptionsare Hall et al., 1965; Pitmanand Speed, 1973; and to
some extentLauritzen,1974; who have made fundamental
use of conditionalindependence
in theirwork.) Some of the areas studiedmay seem entirelyunconnectedwitheach other:

Mr E. F. HARDING (CambridgeUniversity):
This is indeeda superbpaper,on whichit is

The firstconcernsSection2.2 which,apartfromtheBayesianparagraph,says onlythatS,

The sectionappearsto say more,in "turning

In passing,theabove "principle"needsinterpreting,
