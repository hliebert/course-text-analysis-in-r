SUMMARY

This paper proposes a simple technique forassessingthe rangeof plausible causal conclusions fromobservationalstudieswitha binaryoutcome and an observedcategorical
covariate. The technique assesses the sensitivityof conclusions to assumptionsabout
an unobservedbinarycovariaterelevantto both treatmentassignmentand response.A
medical studyof coronaryarterydisease is used to illustratethe technique.

NON-RANDOMIZED STUDIES; SUBCLASSIFICATION

1. INTRODUCTION AND NOTATION

theresultsof clinicalstudiesare subjectto dispute.In observational
Inevitably,
studies,onebasis
fordisputeis obvious:sincepatientswerenotassignedto treatments
at random,
patientsat greater
riskmaybe over-represented
in sometreatment
groups.Thispaperproposesa methodforassessing thesensitivity
of causalconclusionsto an unmeasured
patientcharacteristic
relevantto both
treatment
assignment
and response.Despitetheirlimitations,
observational
studieswillcontinue
to be a valuablesourceof information,
and therefore
it is prudent
to developappropriate
methods
of analysisforthem.
Our sensitivity
analysisconsistsof the estimation
of the averageeffectof a treatment
on a
binaryoutcomevariableafteradjustment
forobservedcategorical
covariatesand an unobserved
binarycovariateu, underseveralsets of assumptions
aboutu. BothCornfield
et al. (1959) and
Bross(1966) have proposedguidelines
fordetermining
whetheran unmeasured
binarycovariate
havingspecifiedproperties
could explainall of theapparenteffectofa treatment,
thatis,whether
the treatment
effect,afteradjustment
foru could be zero.Ourmethodhas twoadvantages:
first,
Cornfieldet al. (1959) and Bross (1966) adjustonly forthe unmeasured
binarycovariateu,
whereaswe adjustformeasuredcovariatesin additionto the unmeasured
covariateu. Second,
Cornfieldet al. (1959) and Bross(1966, 1967) onlyjudgewhetherthe effectof thetreatment
could be zero havingadjustedfor u, whereCornfieldet al. (1959) employan implicityet
extremeassumptionabout u. In contrast,we provideactual estimatesof the treatment
effect
adjustedforbothu andtheobservedcategorical
covariates
underanyassumption
aboutu.
In principle,
the ithof theN patientsunderstudyhas botha binaryresponser1ithatwould
have resultedif he had receivedthe new treatment,
and a binaryresponsero0thatwouldhave
resultedif he had receivedthe controltreatment.
In this formulation,
treatment
effectsare
of r1iand roi,suchas r1i- roi.Sinceeachpatientreceivesonlyone treatment,
comparisons
either
but notboth,andtherefore
comparisons
ofrli androiimplysomedegreeof
rli or ro0is observed,
speculation.
Treatment
effectsdefinedas comparisons
of thetwo potentialresponses,
r1iandroi,
of individualpatientsare implicitin Fisher's(1953) randomization
test of the sharpnull
hypothesisthat rli = roi, i = 1, . . ., N. Such definitionsare used explicitlyby Kempthorne(1952)

in his discussionof randomization-based
in experiments,
and by Rubin(1977, 1978),
inference
Hamilton(1979) and Rosenbaumand Rubin(1983) in discussions
of observational
studies.The
definition
does containsome implicitassumptions,
such as the assumptionof non-interference
betweenpatients;see Cox (1958, Chapter2) or Rubin(1978, Section2.3) fordiscussion.Here,
theN patientsin the studyareviewedas a simplerandomsamplefromsomepopulation,
andthe

whereE

(

E (r1) -E (ro) = pr(r = 1)-pr (ro = l)T1
-ro,
(1.1)
) andpr( ) denoteexpectationandprobability,
respectively,
in thepopulation,

For the ith patientof N patientsin the study(i = 1, . . ., N) let zi be the indicatorfortreatment

and let zi 1 if patienti is assignedto thenew treatment,
and zi = 0 if patienti is

assignedto thecontroltreatment.
or subclassified
Supposethatpatientshavebeen stratified
into
one ofJ subclasseson thebasisof an observedcategorical
andthatpatienti fallsin subcovariate,
class si, i = 1, 2, . . ., N, where si is an integerbetween 1 and J. The population model forthe sub-

variables is assumedto be a saturated
classifying
multinomial.
If thestudyhad been a randomized
blockexperiment
withblocksdefinedby subclasses,
treatz andresponse(rl, ro) wouldbe conditionally
mentassignment

givens, or inDawid's
(1979) notation:
(rl, ro) AL z I s.
(1.2)
in sucha study,1 > pr(z = 0 Is) > 0 forall s. Theseconditions
Moreover,
arenotknownto hold
in an observational
study.Generally,
we shallsaythattreatment
assignment

we shall
say simplythattieatmentassignment
is strongly

is strongly

thenit is ignorable
ignorable,
in Rubin's(1978) sense,buttheconverseis nottrue.
We developand apply a methodto aid in judgingthe sensitivity
of conclusionsto certain
plausiblevariationsin assumptionsabout an unobservedbinarycovariateu. In particular,
we
assumethattreatment
assignment
is not strongly

(1.3)
(rl, ro) 11 z Is, u
is true,where1 > pr(z = Is, u) > 0 forall s, u. If conclusionsare insensitive
overa rangeof
plausibleassumptions
about u, the numberof interpretations
of thedata is reduced,and causal
conclusions
aremoredefensible.
An alternative
approachis brieflymentionedin the reviewby Schlesselman
(1978). In that
approach,however,
theparameter
usedto measuretheeffectof thetreatment,
namely,
O z =0, u = 1,s)
pr(r =0 IZ= , u = 1,s)
pr(r

(1.4)

(or rA in Schlesselman's
notation),refersonly to a subpopulation
of patientsdefinedby the
unobserved
variableu, thatis, thesubpopulation
withu = 1; as a result,as assumptions
aboutu
are varied,themeaningof theparameter
changes.Unlessadditionalassumptions
are made about
the absence of certaininteractioneffects(in particular,that expression(1.4) equals the
corresponding
expressionwithu = 0), thisparameter
is not suitableforsensitivity
analysesthat
considervariousassumptions
about u. Moreover,if the problemis formulated
in termsof the
scalarobservableresponsevariablerz, thenit is impossibleto statethe crucialassumption
(1.3)
underwhichthesensitivity
analysisis correct.

In order to study the sensitivity
of estimatesto the assumptionof stronglyignorable

we now assumethattreatment

is not strongly
ignorable,
but ratherthat

assume(1.2) is falsebut(1.3) is true.Table2 displaysthesensitivity

sensitivity
analysis,(a, 6 1, 6o, r) is assumedin Table 2 to be the sameacrossall subclasses.The
generalmethodpresentedin Sections2 and 4 does not requirethisrestriction;
the

Appendixdisplayssubclassspecificresultswhichdo notdependon thisassumption.
In Table 2, the estimatesof the proportion
improvedvaryfrom0.34 to 0.38 formedicine
and from0.63 to 0.70 forsurgery;
theserangesof valuesof To and "r are aboutthesameas the
standarderrorof the directlyadjustedproportions
(i.e. 0.04 formedicine,0.06 forsurgery).
Consequently,
we see thatthishypothetical,
unobserved
covariateu, whichhas defiedthecardiologists'attemptto recordall variablesusedin assigning
treatments,
wouldhaveto morethantriple
the odds of surgery
and morethantripletheoddsofimprovement,

thattheproportion

Althoughthisdifference
mayreflecta placeboeffectof surgery,
thedifference
does notseemto
be easilyexplainedas theresultof an imbalancedue to the non-randomized
natureof thestudy.
Anotherway of describing
thisanalysisis to saythatwe haveexploredtheextentto whichthe

fromthisperspective,
