1. Introduction
It is often the case that economic variables employed in econometric analyses themselves need to
be estimated before they can be used. Since generated regressors often have large sample wtriation
only because they have large variation in their standard errors across observations, they need to be
modelled as variables measured with error. The main intent of the paper is to demonstrate ways to
deal with generated regressors in linear and nonlinear models which practitioners in all fields should
find useful. A case in point is the innovative and important models in the literature of the political
economy of protection advanced by Grossman and Helpman (1994), (1995). In the next section we
consider two hypotheses fl'om their models and in the third section we perform the estimations using
I
generated regressors.

where t~ is the ad valorem trade taxes or subsidies for good i: z~ is the ratio of domestic output to
imports and e~ is the absolute own price elasticity of import demand." Consider the denominator in the
right-hand side expression, e,. All else equal, industries with high absolute import demand elasticities
or export supply elasticities will have smaller deviations from free trade. The reason is two-fold. First,
the social cost of protection is relatively higher in such industries and the government will be
relatively more averse to protecting these industries. Second, lobbies in industries other than the one
seeking protection who share the deadweight losses, especially upstream industries, will lobby against
protection to that industry. Now consider the numerator, z,. All else equal, industries with great
political power, here reflected in a high ratio of domestic output to imports, z~, will secure greater
protection ~cause in high value-added industries the stakes from protection are greater, inducing
larger political contributions from factors specific to these industries, while low import volume (which
raise z,) does not impose enough of a social cost that would lead to organized opposition against
protection t'or those industries. Hence the prediction that fl>0.

Hypothesis Z (Grossman and Helpman, 1995; restatement of Eq. (25).) Let t, be the home tariff rate
and t~* be the foreign tariff rate on industry i's imports. Then in a 'trade talks' equilibrium the ratio
(~/r*) where ~ = l + t , and 7"*=l+t~*, can be written as a function of home and foreign
output-to-import ratios (z~ and z;*, respectively) and absolute home and foreign import elasticities (e,,
e,*, respectively) as follows:

Eq, (2) is derived from Eq. (25) in Gmssman and Helpman and written in a form suitable for the
empirical analys~s.* The predictive content of this theory is contained in the hypothesis that for
industries that are organized into lobbies in both countries, ~ > 0 and ~* >0. The pattern of protection
reflects equilibrium at two levels. At the domestic level equilibrium is determined by the weight
government places on a marginal dollar of PAC lobbying for protection (which is itself determined
within the Grossman and Helpman (1994) framework of inter-firm political competition) versus a
marginal dollar of welfare loss imposed on the public due to the protection. At the international level
a bargaining equilibrium is determined between two countries conditionally on the sets of (t,t*)
allowed by their domestic equilibria. This is the most theoretically rigorous model in this literature
and makes the most precise prediction about the cross-industry pattern of protection. The prediction
that ~ > 0 and ~ * > 0 means that even though the two governments grant protection to those industries
:The full proposition in Grossman and Helpman (1994) includes industries that are net exporters, but since we have no data
on export supply elasticities, those industries are excluded from the analysis. Since our data is for US trade barriers against
Japan, we do not lose many observations from dropping US (bilateral) net export industries from the US-Japan
cmss~section.

that lobby intensively, where lobbying intensity drops off they are each willing to lower protection
relative to the partner country. The positive coefficient on ( thus conveys the message that the lower
the domestic cost to the US (incorporated in the rhs variable without asterisks in Eq. (2)), the lower its
level of protection relative to its partner. Further, when industries are organized politically on both
sides, it is the difference in the political pressures they are able to apply to their governments that
determine their relative levels of protection.

3. M o d e l

estimation

3.1. M e t h o & d o g y

with generated regressors

In Eqs. ( I ) and (2) the key import elasticity variable needs to be separately estimated. Fo,'tunately.
these elasticities have been estimated for each of the 3-digit SIC industries by Sheills et al. (1986),
which we borrow for ()tit" purpose. 4 Let the variable E (own price elasticity of imports) denote those
elasticity estimates. For some industries i, E, is quite imprecisely estimated while tbr others it is
sharply estimated, with sample values in ! - 2 3 . 8 5 , - 0 . 0 4 2 1 ; s and standard errors in 10.070,118.01.
Clearly, the direct use of the unadjusted E variable will lead to quite erroneous and unpredictable
results. We propose to use an errors-in-variables correction on E based on the methodology in Fuller
(1987). E, is modelled as the observed value of the true (unobserved) own price elasticity of imports,
e,, but which is measured with error:
E, = e, + u~,

(3)

where u, is the measurement error in E, with mean 0 and known va,'iance ,~r~.,~' This variance is equal
to the square of the estimated standard errors reported on the estimates E, in Sheiils el al. (1986).
First consider model ( 1 ). It is linear in parameters although nonlinear in the variable measured with
error. This requires a specitication of the error distribution on the right-hand side variable (z,/E,) or an
approximation, under the presumption z, (the value added-to-imports ratio) is measured accurately. If
we use a Taylor approximation on E i I .:.,, the error variance is 7

"Normality is not needed for consistent estimation, only the weaker conditions in Eqs. (3.1.3) and (3.1.4) of Fuller.
However. normality of Eq. (4) is needed far statistical testing and inference.

To evaluate this expression we use max{E~ 2 _ o'].;, o'~.;} to avoid small numbers. Now Eq. ( ! ) can be
analyzed as a model linear in (z, le,) which is measured as (z, lE~), a variable that has measurement
error with mean zero and variance given by Eq. (4). We can then estimate the model using the method
of moments estimator in Eq. (3. I. 19) of Fuller ( ! 987, p. 193).
Now consider model (2). It is nonlinear in parameters and in the variable measured with error. The
method of moments estimator is difficult to apply here. An alternative, simpler, method (see, e.g.,
Fuller, 1987, Ch. 3) is to replace e; in Eq. (2) by the prediction/~ constructed as follows. Denote the
sample variance of E by O-~: and the mean of the measurement error variances by 0"]. Let
t~'~ = f f ~ - O'~ and E denote the sample mean. Now construct the predictor

Thus, whenever E, has measurement error variance exactly equal to o',. (an estimate for the sample
variance of e, had we been able to measure it exactly) it is presumed to be measured without error.
Otherwise it is scaled down or scaled up according to Eq. (5).s The model in Eq. (2) is then estimated
by nonlinear least squares or ML with the predictor in Eq. (5) used in place of E,.

3.Z Empirical results
Two differences between the theoretical prediction in Eq. (I) and the estimating equations above
should be noted. First, while Grossman and Helpman derive their equation for ad valorem tariffs, we
use NTB coverage ratios as of 1983, since the practice of protection after the Tokyo round has
primarily involved NTBs (see, e.g., Learner, 1990). Second, own import elasticities are available only
for the US. In order to proceed to estimate model (2) we must make the assumption that the
elasticities (true and measured) are the same in the US and its partner countries, that is, E, = E~*.
While this would be quite incorrect if the partner countries were developing countries, this assumptioa
is not unreasonable for similar countries who mostly trade in similar goods. The alternative of
performing the Sheills et al. study for the partner country is a costly one. Construction of the NTB
data and other variables used in the study is detailed in Gawande (1995).
A stochastic version of Eq. ( I ) is used to investigate the Grossman and Helpman (I 994) hypothesis
of protection for sale. in Table I two models are estimated based on Eq. (I): a simple linear model
with just the issue variable ,-,le, together with a constant term, and a model with ten politicaleconomic control variables in addition to the variables in the simple model. These variables are
motivated by Baldwin (1986). In order to group NTBs into somewhat homogeneous categories we run
the models with price NTB coverage ratios (P,) that include and quantitative NTB coverage ratios

~Very large estimated standard errors on E0, can raise ~'~ so high as to lead to a negative value fi~r +}~.This points out that
eslimales or"if, in Shcills el al, with very high standard errors arc "inadmissible'. We drop E, estimates with standard error
e×c~ing 9. After dropping these p~rly measured elasticities and applying the correction in Eq. (5), values of ~, lie in the
interval i-2.35~,,-0.524! which are realistic elasticity values. By contrast the uncorrected E, values were contained in the
la~e imerval [-23.85,-0.~21. Taking account of the positive values of E, that were dropped from consideration earlier, we
ha~,'e a sample size of 247.

report the m e t h o d of m o m e n t s estimates using Eq. ( 3 . ! . 1 9 ) in Fuller (1987). In the c o l u m n s under
" N o errors in variables c o r r e c t i o n " are reported O L S estimates. Before e x a m i n i n g the effect of
m e a s u r e m e n t errors, consider the nature of the inferences about the G r o s s m a n and H e l p m a n
hypothesis. The main implication of the G r o s s m a n and H e l p m a n hypothesis is that f l > 0 ; industries
with greater stakes (higher value added-to-imports ratio) and lower potential for d e a d w e i g h t losses
(smaller absolute import elasticities) will succeed in obtaining greater protection. This is borne out by
US price N T B s on imports from Japan, but not by US quantitative N T B s on imports from Japan. Price
N T B s are similar to ad valorem tariffs in their effects than are quantitative restrictions, and therefore
"Price NTBs include, for example, antidumping and countervailing duties, and quantitative NTBs include quotas and
voluntary export restraint agreements. Hence P, and Q, replace t, in the Grossman and Helpman model. We ran the models
with post-Tokyo round tariffs, but tbund no support for the theory from that data.

are closer in spirit to the Grossman and Helpman theory which is framed in terms of tariffs, t° If the
theory is judged in terms of the price NTB results, the estimates provide sot~le support for the theory.
However, that support is statistically weak. When there is no correction for measurement errors in E~,
and E, is used in place of e,, the estimate on fl of 0.166 from the simple model is statistically
significant at 5% (right-tailed test) and the estimate of 0.253 from the general model is statistically
significant at I%. However the method of moments estimates after the EIV corrections, while larger in
magnitude than the OLS estimates (0.221 from the simple model and 0.365 from the general model)
are not statistically significant. The increased standard error of estimate(s), which is a well-known
result in the EIV literature, is the main effect of the EIV correction; if we remove the variation in E
that arises from measurement error from the precision matrix X'X, this has the effect of making the
matrix of regressors X more collinear. This reduces the intbrmation contained in the data about
individual coefficient, which is then reflected in higher standard errors or lower t-values. Hence, if we
wish to correct for EIV and want sharper inferences, the only recourse is through the use of personal
prior information, as suggested by Klepper and Learner (1984). Another effect of the EIV correction,
but not obvious from Table I since the full results are not reported, is that variables other than the
variable measured with error are affected, usually adversely, upon making the required EIV correction.
This point is underscored in the application of Klepper et al. (1993).
In order to examine Hypotheses 2 about the bargaining equilibrium postulated by Grossman and
Helpman (1995), we estimate a stochastic version of Eq. (2) which we report in Table 2, The
Grossman-Helpman hypothesis is the joint hypothesis ~:>0 and so*>0. A weaker hypothesis is that
either one of the inequality holds. For our controls, we use just tour industry-group dummies (Food,
Resource-intensive, Manufacturing, Capital-intensive), described in Note 4 of Table 2, so as to give
equal and symmetric treatment to US and Japan NTBs. tt First consider the nature of the inferences.
The only result that conforms to the GH prediction is the positive estimate on s~* from Model 2 (with
controls) with dependent variable ( l + P , ) / ( I + N * ) . Otherwise the results go against the Grossman
and Helpman predictions. What are we to infer about the Grossman and Helpman theory upon which
the prediction is based? Probably not much, The results may mostly indicate that as of 1983,
US=Japan NTBs did not display the characteristics of a bargaining equilibrium. That is probably true
since US=Japan trade relations at the time, as now, could be better described as a trade war and NTB
escalation rather than a period of compromise. A test of the theory will probably have to wait until
after the effects of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act, which allows the US greater bargaining strength
through the delivery of stronger and more credible threats, work themselves out. Now consider the
effect of the EIV correction using Eq. (4). Here, the effect of the EIV correction is different from the
effect on the method of moment (MOM) estimates of Table I. In Table 2 the use of the EIV-corrected
variable leads to larger coefficients with higher t-values. The methodology used for the nonlinear
model is due to the fact that the method for Hypothesis I cannot be employed here. Since this model
is nonlinear in parameters, the MOM computations are difficult, sometimes even impossible, to
perform. The price paid in order to use this simpler methodology is that the estimates are biased. The
"'~rhaps the results based on quantitative NTBs may be an indication that coverage ratios are not adequate measures of the
restrictiveness of quotas and voluntary e×port restrictions that are the main quantitative instruments used by the US. The
costly construction of tariff equivalents for individual industries may be required if more precise inferences are required.
~lThe set of political economic control variables is available only for the US and not Japan. Hence industry dummies are
used, The measures of fit indicate an adequate fit for the cross-sectional data.

argument for its use is that this bias can be significantly lower than if the correction were not made) 2
Given the large range of sample values for E~, we presume that the bias is substantially reduced due to
the correction.

4. Conclusion
The need to use estimates from separate studies as regressors often arises. Such regressors need to
be modelled as variables measured with error. The innovative models of Grossman and Helpman
(1994), (1995) make simple testable predictions, but since import elasticities across industries figure
prominently in their predictions elasticity estimates from a separate study need to be used in place of
the true elasticities. We demonstrate how to deal with this problem of using generated regressors in (i)
a linear setting and (ii) a nonlinear setting.
~2Fuller (1987, p. 268) provides an estimator tbr the bias.
