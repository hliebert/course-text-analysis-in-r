When consensus choice dominates individualism: Jensen’s
inequality and collective decisions under uncertainty
Charles F. Manski
Department of Economics and Institute for Policy Research, Northwestern University

Research on collective provision of private goods has focused on distributional
considerations. This paper studies a class of problems of decision under uncertainty in which an efficiency argument for collective choice emerges from the
mathematics of aggregating individual payoffs. Consider decision making when
each member of a population has the same objective function, which depends on
an unknown state of nature. If agents knew the state of nature, they would make
the same decision. However, they may have different beliefs or may use different decision criteria to cope with their incomplete knowledge. Hence, they may
choose different actions even though they share the same objective. Let the set of
feasible actions be convex and the objective function be concave in actions, for
all states of nature. Then Jensen’s inequality implies that consensus choice of the
mean privately chosen action yields a larger mean payoff than does individualistic decision making, in all states of nature. If payoffs are transferable, the mean
payoff from consensus choice may be allocated to Pareto dominate individualistic
decision making. I develop these ideas. I also use Jensen’s inequality to show that a
planner with the power to assign actions to the members of the population should
not diversify. Finally, I give a version of the collective-choice result that holds with
consensus choice of the median rather than mean action.

1. Introduction
Economists working in the utilitarian paradigm have a strong predisposition to think
that individualistic decision making regarding private goods is more efficient than collective choice. Research on public provision of private goods, whether normative or positive, has largely focused on distributional considerations. See, for example, Blackorby
and Donaldson (1988), Besley and Coate (1991), Bruce and Waldman (1991), Blomquist
and Christiansen (1995), and Epple and Romano (1996).
Researchers have occasionally provided efficiency arguments for collective decision making. Garratt and Marshall (1994) argued that public finance of higher education brings into existence a desirable gambling market that would not exist otherwise.

Coate (1995) combined distributional and efficiency concerns by considering an economy with altruistic agents. Fang and Norman (2008) examined a setting where government observation of demand for publicly provided goods reveals private information
that is useful in setting tax policy.
This paper develops a distinct efficiency rationale for collective choice of private
goods. I study a simple problem of private decision making under uncertainty in which
the argument for collective choice emerges directly from the mathematics of aggregating individual payoffs.
I mainly consider decision making when each member of a population faces the
same choice problem and wants to optimize the same objective function, which maps
actions and an unknown state of nature into outcomes. If agents knew the state of nature, they would make the same decision. However, they may have different beliefs about
the state or may cope with their incomplete knowledge by using different decision criteria. Hence, acting independently, they may choose different actions even though they
share the same objective.
For example, some agents may believe that they know the state of nature and, hence,
choose an action that maximizes the objective function in this state. Others may have
probabilistic beliefs and maximize expected utility with heterogeneous subjective probability distributions and risk preferences. Yet others, not having probabilistic beliefs,
may use varying criteria for decision making under ambiguity, such as the maximinor minimax-regret criterion.
Applied economics abounds with research in which agents are assumed to maximize expected utility with heterogeneous beliefs or risk preferences. Economists often
suppose that agents have common priors and that heterogeneity in probabilistic beliefs
stems from individual observation of different data (private signals). They sometimes
argue that agents may hold divergent probabilistic opinions even when all information
is public, the reason being that they interpret this information differently. For example,
in the field of financial economics, see Miller (1977), Mayshar (1983), Harris and Raviv
(1993), and Kandel and Pearson (1995).
Applied study of choice under ambiguity has been much less common, but warrants
considerable attention. In research over the past decade, I have studied a variety of settings in which ambiguity arises from partial identification of the relevant state of nature.
I have emphasized that heterogeneity in nonprobabilistic beliefs may occur when individuals observe the same data but make different nonrefutable assumptions about what
states of nature are feasible. See Manski (2000, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010).
Suppose that the set of feasible actions is convex and the objective function is concave in actions for all states of nature. In this context, Section 2 shows that population
coordination on a specific consensus action yields a larger mean payoff than does individualistic decision making in all states of nature. The consensus action with this remarkable property is the mean action that agents would choose independently. This
result is an immediate consequence of Jensen’s inequality. I use input choice by firms
and asset allocation by investors to illustrate the result. I show its robustness to some
relaxations of the assumption that each member of the population wants to optimize
the same concave objective function.

Consensus choice dominates individualism 189

Section 3 shows that if payoffs are transferable, the mean payoff realized by collective
choice of the consensus action may be allocated across the population so that collective
choice Pareto dominates individualistic decision making in all states of nature. A Pareto
dominating collective-choice mechanism is implementable if agents truthfully reveal
the actions they would choose individualistically. I give conditions under which truthful
revelation is incentive compatible.
I also compare collective choice with an alternative in which agents first reveal
their choice-relevant attributes to one another and then make individualistic decisions. The outcome of this mechanism depends on what agents learn about each
other. Communication-augmented private choice makes collective choice unnecessary
if agents learn that heterogeneity stems solely from the existence of private signals. However, collective choice Pareto dominates communication-augmented private choice if
agents learn that heterogeneity stems from differing assumptions about the feasible
states of nature, differing prior probabilistic beliefs, or differing decision criteria.
Whereas Section 3 concerns decision making by a population whose members must
agree on a collective-choice mechanism, Section 4 considers treatment choice by a planner who has the power to assign actions to the members of the population. Here Jensen’s
inequality implies that any heterogeneous treatment of the population is dominated by
assigning the associated mean treatment to all persons. Thus, the planner should not
diversify treatment. I explain why this result differs from the positive findings for diversification obtained in Manski (2009, 2010). There I studied different classes of planning
problems, where the choice set may not be convex, treatments may be interdependent
across persons, and agents may have heterogeneous, nonconcave objective functions.
Except for the discussion of robustness in Section 2, the paper thus far concerns
decision making with a convex choice set and a common concave objective function.
Section 5 supposes instead that the choice set is ordered and that agents have objective
functions that are unimodal in each state of nature. The state-specific mode is invariant
across agents, but the objective functions may otherwise vary. In this setting, I show
that consensus choice of the median individualistic action makes the majority of agents
better off than they would be with private choice in all states of nature. This result is
closely related to the median voter theorem.
The analysis of this paper is simple and straightforward. It nevertheless appears to
be new to research on collective choice of private goods. The closest connection that
I have been able to discover is to the distantly related literature on consensus forecasting. Section 6 makes this connection. Section 7 makes concluding remarks about the
broader implications of this work for social choice theory.
2. Analysis with a convex choice set and a concave objective function
2.1 Notation and concepts
To begin, let (J  P) be a probability space of agents, each of whom must choose an
action from a set X. Here J lists the agents, the σ-algebra  places probability on individual agents, and P is the probability measure. For example, J may be a finite group of

190 Charles F. Manski

Quantitative Economics 1 (2010)

size |J|, in which case P(j) = 1/|J| for j ∈ J. Alternatively, J may be a continuum indexed
by the unit interval, in which case P is the uniform distribution on [0 1].
The set S lists states of nature. The objective function f (· ·) : X × S → R maps actions
and states into the real line. Each agent wants to choose an action that maximizes f (· r),
where r ∈ S is the actual state of nature. All agents know that r ∈ S, but they may not
know the identity of r. Hence, they may not be able to solve the optimization problem
maxx∈X f (x r).
Agents may have different beliefs about r. Some may think that all elements of S
are feasible states, while others may believe that only certain elements of S are feasible.
Some may place complete subjective probability distributions on the states they consider feasible, while others may have incomplete probabilistic beliefs, or no beliefs at
all. Agents may use different decision criteria to make choices with their beliefs. In any
case, let xj be the action that agent j ∈ J would choose
in a regime of individualistic

decision making. Then the mean payoff in state s is f (xj  s) dP(j).
Consider an alternative regime of collective choice in which all agents choose some
consensus action, say c ∈ X. Then the mean payoff in state s is f (c s) dP(j) = f (c s).
The question of interest is whether there exists a consensus choice that improves on
individualistic decision making. The answer is positive if X is convex and if f (· s) is
concave on X for each s ∈ S.


2.2 Collective choice of the mean action

Let μ ≡ xj dP(j) denote the mean individualistic action and assume that μ is finite.
Convexity of X implies that μ ∈ X, so μ is a feasible action. The mean payoff with collective choice of μ is f (μ s). Jensen’s inequality gives

f (μ s) ≥ f (xj  s) dP(j) for all s ∈ S
(1)
Thus, in all states of nature, the mean payoff with consensus choice of action μ is at least
as large as with individualistic
decision making.

Let g(s) ≡ f (μ s) − f (xj  s) dP(j) denote the mean surplus achieved by consensus
choice of μ. This surplus is nonnegative by (1). It ordinarily is positive, a familiar sufficient condition being that f (· s) is strictly concave and Var(xj ) > 0.
It is important to understand that nonnegativity of mean surplus in all states of nature does not imply that agents would choose action μ when making individualistic decisions. To the contrary, xj is the action that agent j would choose. Thus, each agent
j prefers to choose xj with state-dependent payoff f (xj  ·), rather than choose μ with
payoff f (μ ·).
The above implies that if payoffs are nontransferable across the population, agents
unanimously prefer individualistic choice of (xj  j ∈ J) to collective choice of μ, despite
the fact that the latter generates a nonnegative mean surplus in all states of nature.
Nontransferability of payoffs is critical to this result. Section 3 will show that there exist regimes with collective choice of μ that Pareto dominate individualistic choice of
(xj  j ∈ J) when payoffs are transferable. This will be accomplished by combining collective choice of μ with a suitable allocation of payoffs after the true state of nature becomes known.

2.3 Illustrative applications to production decisions
Result (1) has many applications in which a group of firms or other agents have a common concave production function and want to choose inputs to maximize profit. Here
are two examples.
Production by firms when product price is unknown
Let J be a group of price-taking firms that face the same concave production function. In particular, let the set of feasible inputs be X = [0 ∞) and let output be log(x + 1).
Let the unit cost of input be 1, and let product price be s. Then the profit function is
f (x s) = s · log(x + 1) − x. Suppose that firms do not know product price when they
choose input quantities. For example, the firms may be farms of equal size that must
decide how intensively to plant in the spring before knowing the crop price that they
will receive at harvest.
Let the set S of feasible prices be a subset of the half-line [0 ∞). Suppose each firm
places a subjective distribution on price and maximizes expected profit. Let pj be the
subjective mean price held by firm j. Acting independently, firm j would solve the problem maxx∈X pj · log(x + 1) − x, yielding the input choice xj = max(0 pj − 1). Suppose that
pj ≥ 1 for all j ∈ J. Then μ = E(p) − 1.
In state s, the mean payoffs with collective choice of input quantity μ and with individualistic decision making are, respectively,
f (μ s) = s · log[E(p)] − E(p) + 1

f (xj  s) dP(j) = sE[log(p)] − E(p) + 1
Hence, the surplus achieved by consensus choice of μ is g(s) = s{log[E(p)] − E[log(p)]}.
Allocation of an endowment between a safe asset and production with unknown return
Let J be a group of investors, each having an endowment of size 1. Suppose that each
investor must allocate his endowment between a safe asset with known return 1 and a
productive activity with unknown return. The set of feasible choices is X = [0 1], where
x ∈ X denotes the fraction of the endowment allocated to the productive activity. Let the
return to production be s · x1/2 , where S = (0 ∞). Then the return to allocation x in state
of nature s is s · x1/2 + (1 − x).
Suppose that each investor places a subjective distribution on S and maximizes expected return. Let qj be the subjective mean of s for investor j. Acting independently, j
would solve the problem maxx∈X qj · x1/2 + (1 − x), yielding the choice xj = min(1 qj2 /4).
Suppose that qj ≤ 2 for all j ∈ J. Then μ = E(q2 )/4.
In state s, the mean payoffs with collective choice of input quantity μ and with individualistic decision making are, respectively,
f (μ s) = (s/2) · [E(q2 )]1/2 + 1 − E(q2 )/4

f (xj  s) dP(j) = (s/2) · E(q) + 1 − E(q2 )/4

192 Charles F. Manski

Quantitative Economics 1 (2010)

Hence, the surplus achieved by consensus choice of μ is g(s) = (s/2)[E(q2 )1/2 − E(q)].
2.4 Relaxing the assumption of a common concave objective function
Observe that result (1) requires no restrictions on the beliefs that agents hold about the
actual state of nature or on the decision criteria they use to cope with incomplete knowledge. The result as stated does presume that each agent has the same concave objective
function. Although some semblance of this condition seems essential, some relaxation
is possible. I consider two scenarios here.
Collective choice within subpopulations
Let the population be composed of K types. Persons of a given type have the same
concave objective function, but this function may vary across types. Let μk denote the
mean action that would be privately chosen by persons of type k. Consider collective
choice in subpopulations, with all persons of type k choosing action μk . A possible application to agricultural cooperatives will be discussed in Section 3.4.

Application of (1) to persons of type k gives f (μk  s) ≥ f (xj  s) dP(j|k) for all s ∈ S.


Averaging payoffs across types gives k f (μk  s)P(k) ≥ f (xj  s) dP(j), where P(k) is
the fraction of type-k persons in the population. Thus, the mean payoff from collective
choice within each of the K subpopulations is at least as large as that produced by individualistic decision making.
Neighborhoods of a common concave function
Suppose that each agent j ∈ J has a person-specific, not necessarily concave,
objective function fj (· ·) : X × S → R. Then the mean payoffs in state of nature s

with individualistic decision making and collective choice of μ are fj (xj  s) dP(j)

and fj (μ s) dP(j), respectively. Collective choice achieves a nonnegative surplus if

fj (μ s) dP(j) ≥ fj (xj  s) dP(j). This inequality can hold if agents do not share the same
concave objective function. In particular, it holds if all agents have objective functions
that are sufficiently close to a common concave function.
For each state s, let there exist a λ(s) > 0 and a concave function f (· s) : X → R such
that
sup |fj (w s) − f (w s)| < λ(s)
w∈Xj∈J


As earlier, let g(s) ≡ f (μ s) − f (xj  s) dP(j) denote the mean surplus that occurs with
function f . Mean surplus with the actual objective functions fj (· s), j ∈ J, satisfies the
inequality


fj (μ s) dP(j) − fj (xj  s) dP(j) ≥ g(s) − 2λ(s)
Hence, the condition λ(s) ≤ g(s)/2 suffices to ensure that actual surplus is nonnegative.

3. Pareto dominant collective-choice mechanisms
3.1 Allocation of transferable payoffs
I observed in Section 2.2 that if payoffs are nontransferable across the population, agents
unanimously prefer individualistic choice of (xj  j ∈ J) to collective choice of μ, despite
the fact that the latter generates nonnegative mean surplus in all states of nature. This
section shows that if payoffs are transferable, there exist collective-choice mechanisms
that Pareto dominate private choice.
Let γ ≡ [γj (s) (j s) ∈ J × S] be any set of positive real numbers such that

γj (s) dP(j) = 1 for all s ∈ S. Consider a collective choice mechanism in which agents
take the consensus action μ and, if the state of nature turns out to be s, agent j receives
the payoff
hj (γ s) ≡ f (xj  s) + γj (s)g(s)

(2)

These collective-choice payoffs weakly dominate payoffs with private choice; that is,
hj (γ s) ≥ f (xj  s) for all s ∈ S and hj (γ s) > f (xj  s) for some s. Payoffs (2) are feasible be
cause hj (γ s) dP(j) = f (μ s). Hence, the collective-choice mechanism is feasible and
Pareto dominates individualistic decision making. That is, each agent j prefers collective choice of μ with state-dependent payoff f (xj  ·) + γj (·)g(·) to individualistic choice
of xj with payoff f (xj  ·).
Observe that a collective-choice mechanism of this type benefits even an agent who
knows the actual state of nature with certainty. The consensus action μ may differ from
what such an agent knows to be the optimal action. Nonetheless, he receives at least the
payoff that he would have achieved by private choice.
Our finding that consensus choice of a private good Pareto dominates individualistic
decision making goes against conventional economic wisdom. It has been common to
think that, absent distributional considerations, private choice must be Pareto superior
to collective choice. The standard utilitarian argument is that when agents want to make
different choices, collective choice of a single good creates deadweight loss.
The present analysis shows that it is important to ask why agents want to make different choices. The standard utilitarian argument is correct in deterministic settings,
where variation in private choices stems from heterogeneity in choice sets or objective
functions. In decisions under uncertainty, variation in private choices may stem from
heterogeneity in agents’ beliefs about the state of nature or in their decision criteria.
The latter sources of heterogeneity are the driving force behind result (1). When agents
have the same convex choice set and concave objective function, (1) shows that consensus choice creates mean surplus. This enables the Pareto improvement achieved by
mechanism (2).
Contrast with collective insurance
The collective choice mechanism introduced here differs from collective insurance.
In insurance systems, agents make individualistic decisions and then smooth payoffs
across states of nature. Insurance increases payoffs in states with relatively bad private
outcomes and decreases payoffs in states with relatively good private outcomes.

194 Charles F. Manski

Quantitative Economics 1 (2010)

Formally, agent j privately chooses action xj and receives payoff f (xj  s) + ϕj (s) −
cj should state s occur. Here cj > 0 is a state-invariant insurance premium. The term
ϕj (s) is a state-dependent insurance payment, with ϕj (s) = 0 in states where f (xj  s) is
relatively large and ϕj (s) > cj in states where f (xj  s) is relatively small.
A collective insurance system is feasible if mean payments do not exceed mean pre

miums in every state of nature; that is, if ϕj (s) dP(j) ≤ cj dP(j) for all s ∈ S. This set
of inequalities formalizes the idea that it is infeasible to insure against systemic risks.
Insurance is feasible only if, in every state of nature, the subpopulation of agents who
experience bad private outcomes and receive payments is sufficiently small that mean
premiums cover their payments.
In contrast to insurance, our agents all choose the consensus action μ. In every state
of nature, they receive payoffs (2) that are at least as large as their private outcomes under individualistic decision making. These payoffs are feasible because collective choice
of μ generates a nonnegative mean surplus in every state of nature.
3.2 Truthful revelation of private choices
Implementation of the collective-choice mechanism requires knowledge of the actions
that agents would choose privately. Research on mechanism design has long sought to
determine when it is incentive compatible for agents to reveal private information truthfully. Here we would like each agent to announce his private choice truthfully.
In a regime of private choice, agent j receives payoff f (xj  s) in state s. Let xaj denote the action that j announces under the collective-choice mechanism and let μa ≡
 a
xj dP(j) denote the mean of the announced actions. Then
(2 )

haj (γ s) ≡ f (xaj  s) + γj (s)ga (s)

is the collective-choice payoff based on announcements. Here ga (s) ≡ f (μa  s) −

f (xaj  s) dP(j) is the mean surplus in state s.
Private- and collective-choice payoffs differ, so agent j would not necessarily announce xaj = xj . However, truthful revelation is incentive compatible in some settings.
I show here that it is if the population is a continuum and agents either maximize expected payoff or minimize maximum regret.
Suppose that the population is a continuum. Then the action announced by agent j
does not affect ga (s). Here, as in analysis of other collective decision problems, the idea
of a continuum of agents is a simplifying idealization, meant to approximate a large
finite population. In a large finite population, an agent’s announced action negligibly
affects mean surplus.

pression γj (s)ga (s) dπj does not vary with x. Hence, xaj = xj .
Suppose that j minimizes maximum regret. In this case, xaj = xj because, for each
x ∈ X and s ∈ S,
max[f (w s) + γj (s)ga (s)] − [f (x s) + γj (s)ga (s)] = max f (w s) − f (x s)

The left-hand side of the equation is regret in state s for announcing action x. The righthand side is regret in state s for choosing x in a regime of private choice. The equation
holds because the population is a continuum, so ga (s) does not vary with w or x.
3.3 Communication-augmented private choice
An alternative to the collective-choice mechanism proposed here is private choice after communication between agents. For example, economists have studied the operation of trade associations, in which firms reveal private signals to one another and
then make individualistic decisions. See, for example, Gal-Or (1985), Shapiro (1986), and
Vives (1990).
Under our maintained assumptions, each agent’s payoff in a regime of individualistic decision making is independent of the actions chosen by other agents. Hence, agents
should be indifferent regarding communication of private information to other agents.
To make the best case for private choice, suppose that agents truthfully reveal all of their
choice-relevant attributes to one another and that this is common knowledge. Thus,
they announce their assumptions about the feasible states of nature, their prior probabilistic beliefs if such exist, the private signals they receive, and the decision criteria they
use. They then make communication-augmented private choices.
The outcome of this mechanism depends on what agents learn about each other.
Two polar scenarios illustrates the possibilities. First suppose agents learn that heterogeneity stems solely from the existence of private signals about the state of nature. Then agents are identical after they reveal their private signals. Hence, they make
identical communication-augmented private choices. There is, therefore, no need for a
collective-choice mechanism.
Now suppose agents learn that there are no private signals. Instead, heterogeneity
stems from differing assumptions about the feasible states of nature, differing probabilistic beliefs, or differing decision criteria. For example, they may learn that they all
maximize expected utility but have different risk preferences. Then, absent social influences such as a preference for conformity, communication reveals no information
relevant to individual decision making. Hence, the collective choice mechanism of Section 3.1 Pareto dominates communication-augmented private choice.
It would be useful to consider scenarios where communication reveals heterogeneity in private signals as well as in assumptions or decision criteria. Then communication
and collective choice may both be of value. Study of such scenarios is beyond the scope
of this paper.
3.4 Application to agricultural cooperatives
Is the collective choice mechanism introduced here only of theoretical interest or might
it have useful applications? The mechanism may prove helpful to stimulate the formation and guide the operation of agricultural cooperatives. I use crop production to illustrate.
Consider a geographically concentrated group of price-taking farmers. Crop production approximates the conditions assumed in this paper reasonably closely. Farmers

196 Charles F. Manski

Quantitative Economics 1 (2010)

share the common objective of profit maximization. They typically have concave production functions and convex choice sets with diminishing returns to inputs of seed,
fertilizer, labor, and irrigation. The farmers in a given locale face approximately homogeneous climate, soil conditions, input costs, and crop prices. Hence, their profit functions are approximately homogeneous. Finally, profits are a transferable payoff. Thus,
the conditions for application of result (1) and mechanism (2) approximately hold.
The surplus generated by consensus choice is greatest in settings with considerable
uncertainty, where agents with disperse beliefs and decision criteria make heterogeneous private choices. Farmers making planting decisions in the spring face considerable uncertainty about the crop prices they will receive in the fall, as well as uncertainty
about crop yield arising from the difficulty of predicting weather during the planting
season. In a private-choice regime, farmers may cope with this uncertainty in different
ways, varying the allocation of fields to alternative crops, the timing of planting, and so
on. Hence, consensus choice may generate meaningful surplus.
A cooperative could determine the consensus input bundle in late winter, prior to
initiation of the annual production cycle in the spring. Each farmer in the cooperative
would report the input bundle he would choose if he made production decisions individualistically. The mean announced bundle would become the consensus choice.
To the best of my knowledge, agricultural cooperatives do not currently function in
this manner. They may communicate information, share farming machinery, market
crops, operate credit unions, and perform other services for members. However, I am
not aware of cooperatives that make consensus production decisions and allocate payoffs as proposed here.
4. Implications for planning: Uniform treatment dominates diversification
Sections 2 and 3 considered decision making when the members of a population collectively agree on a consensus choice. This section concerns a planner who has the power
to assign actions. The planner’s objective is to maximize the mean payoff.
When studying planning problems, actions are often called treatments. The planner’s problem is to choose treatments. A planner with incomplete knowledge of the state
of nature has partial knowledge of treatment response. I have previously studied various
planning problems that do not have a convex choice set and homogeneous concave objective function. I show here that this structure qualitatively affects findings.
Suppose that a planner can assign each agent any feasible action. Thus, the planner
can choose any element of the Cartesian product set X |J| . Let w ≡ (wj  j ∈ J) be any set

of assigned actions with finite mean μw ≡ wj dP(j). Jensen’s inequality gives

f (μw  s) ≥ f (wj  s) dP(j) for all s ∈ S
(3)
Result (3) shows that, in each state, the mean payoff when the planner assigns every
agent action μw is at least as large as the payoff with the possibly heterogeneous assignments (wj  j ∈ J). In other words, any diversified treatment of the population is dominated by assigning the associated mean treatment to all persons.

Quantitative Economics 1 (2010)

Consensus choice dominates individualism 197

This finding differs sharply from one that I reported previously (Manski (2007,
2009)). There I studied a class of planning problems in which diversified treatment of
observationally identical persons is always undominated. In particular, I studied problems where the choice set X contains only two elements, say a and b. I also permitted
heterogeneous objective functions (fj  j ∈ J).

Let α(s) ≡ fj (a s) dP(j) denote the mean payoff in state s when all agents receive

treatment a and, similarly, let β(s) ≡ fj (b s) dP(j). Consider a treatment allocation
that randomly assigns a fraction δ ∈ [0 1] of the population to treatment b and 1 − δ to
treatment a. Let the population be a continuum. Then the payoff to allocation δ in state
s is (1 − δ)α(s) + δβ(s). Suppose that the planner faces ambiguity; that is, there exists
a state s with α(s) > β(s) and another state s  with α(s ) < β(s ). Then it is immediate
that all δ ∈ [0 1] are undominated. Moreover, it can be shown that the minimax-regret
allocation always diversifies treatment.
Result (3) shows that the situation differs dramatically if all convex combinations of a
and b are feasible treatments and all agents have the same concave objective function f .
Then, for all δ ∈ (0 1) and s ∈ S, assigning every agent to treatment (1 − δ)a + δb yields
at least as large a payoff as does the diversified allocation assigning fraction δ to b and
1 − δ to a. Formally,
f [(1 − δ)a + δb s] ≥ (1 − δ)f (a s) + δf (b s)
= (1 − δ)α(s) + δβ(s)

for all s ∈ S

Medical treatment with partial knowledge of treatment response illustrates when diversification is and is not a reasonable strategy. Consider first an organ disease with two alternative treatments. One is surgery to repair the organ and the other is replacement of
the organ with a transplant. Convex combinations of these treatments are not feasible—
one can only repair or replace. In a setting of this sort, diversification warrants consideration when it is not clear which treatment is better. Some fraction of patients would have
the organ repaired and the remaining fraction would receive transplants. The minimaxregret criterion provides a coherent method to choose the fractions.
Now consider exercise as a treatment intended to increase life-span. Here convex
combinations of treatments are feasible: one can exercise in low, high, or intermediate intensities. Suppose that the objective function is concave and homogeneous across
the relevant patient population, with diminishing marginal returns to higher intensity
of exercise. Then a planner should not vary intensity across patients. Any diversified
treatment strategy is dominated by one in which all patients exercise at the mean of the
diversified intensities.
5. Analysis with an ordered choice set and unimodal objective functions
Section 2.4 showed that collective choice of the mean action may dominate individualistic decision making in circumstances where agents do not have the same concave

objective function. However, this goes only so far. Result (1) certainly does not hold universally.
This section presents a weaker result that holds when X is an ordered set of actions
and each agent j has an objective function fj (· ·) : X × S → R that is unimodal on X for
each s ∈ S. Set X need not be convex; it may, for example, be a discrete subset of the real
line. Objective functions may vary across agents, except that they share the same mode.
Formally, I assume that, for each s ∈ S, x(s) ≡ arg maxx∈X fj (x s) is invariant across j ∈ J.
Let m denote the median individualistic action; that is, m ≡ inf{t : P(xj ≤ t) ≥ 1/2}.
I will show that, in every state of nature, a majority of agents receive at least as high a
payoff with consensus choice of action m as with individualistic decision making. That
is,
P[fj (m s) ≥ fj (xj  s)] ≥ 1/2 for all s ∈ S

(4)

Proof of Equation (4). Result (4) is a special case of a result that holds for any quantile
of the distribution of individualistic actions. For κ ∈ (0 1), let qκ denote the κ-quantile
individualistic action; that is, qκ ≡ inf{t : P(xj ≤ t) ≥ κ}. The general result is
P[fj (qκ  s) ≥ fj (xj  s)] ≥ min(κ 1 − κ) for all s ∈ S

(5)

To show (5), consider separately the cases in which qκ = x(s), qκ < x(s), and qκ > x(s).
First let qκ = x(s). Then P[fj (qκ  s) ≥ fj (xj  s)] = 1. Next let qκ < x(s). Then P[fj (qκ 
s) ≥ fj (xj  s)] ≥ P(xj ≤ qκ ) ≥ κ. Now let qκ > x(s). Then P[fj (qκ  s) ≥ fj (xj  s)] ≥ P(xj ≥
qκ ) ≥ 1 − κ. Combining these cases yields (5). Result (4) is the special case with κ =
1/2.

Result (4) brings to mind the median voter theorem of Black (1948), which also considered an ordered set of actions and unimodal objective functions. Indeed (4) shows
that, given knowledge of the state of nature, a majority of agents prefer consensus choice
of action m to the set (xj  j ∈ J) of individualistic actions. However, (4) does not imply
that a majority of agents prefer m ex ante, before the actual state is known. Recall that xj
is the action that agent j chooses in a regime with private choice. Thus, the population
unanimously prefers private choice of (xj  j ∈ J) to consensus choice of m.
While result (4) is interesting, it is less powerful than (1), in the sense that it does not
provide the foundation for a Pareto dominant collective-choice mechanism. The mean


surplus in state s with collective choice of m is fj (m s) dP(j) − fj (xj  s) dP(j). Result
(4) does not determine the sign of this quantity. If there exists a state of nature where
mean surplus is negative, it is not possible in this state to allocate payoffs so that all
agents are better off than they would be with private choice.
6. Jensen’s inequality and research on consensus forecasting
The analysis in this paper appears to be entirely new to research on collective choice
of private goods. However, a version of result (1) has received sporadic recognition in
research on the distantly related subject of consensus forecasts. I discuss some of the
history here.

Quantitative Economics 1 (2010)

Consensus choice dominates individualism 199

For over a century, beginning at least as early as Galton (1907), researchers studying
the accuracy of forecasts have studied settings in which multiple agents are asked to
give point forecasts of a quantity and their forecasts are combined to create a consensus
forecast. It is particularly common to define the consensus forecast as the cross-sectional
mean of the individual forecasts.
Empirical studies have regularly found that the cross-sectional mean forecast is
more accurate than the individual forecasts used to form the mean. Clemen (1989,
p. 559) put it this way in a review article:
The results have been virtually unanimous: combining multiple forecasts leads to increased forecast accuracy. This has been the result whether the forecasts are judgmental or
statistical, econometric or extrapolation. Furthermore, in many cases one can make dramatic performance improvements by simply averaging the forecasts.

Researchers have been intrigued by this empirical regularity, which has recently become
known popularly as the wisdom of crowds (Surowiecki (2004)). Various reasons have
been suggested. In fact, the empirical regularity follows from Jensen’s inequality.
Let yn , n = 1     N, be a set of individual point forecasts of an unknown real quantity

θ, let PN denote the cross-sectional distribution of the forecasts, and let μN ≡ y dPN
denote the cross-sectional mean forecast. Let L(· ·) : R × R → [0 ∞) be a loss function used to measure the consequence of prediction error. Research on forecasting has
typically used absolute loss L(y θ) = |y − θ| or square loss L(y θ) = (y − θ)2 . When
these or any other convex loss function are used, Jensen’s inequality gives L(μN  θ) ≤

L(y θ) dPN for all θ ∈ R. Thus, whatever the actual value of the quantity being forecast, the loss associated with the mean forecast is no larger than the mean loss of the
individual forecasts.
This simple result has long been known in statistical decision theory. There θ is a parameter to be estimated and (yn  n = 1     N) is a randomized estimate, meaning that
the statistician draws an integer i at random from the set (1     N) and uses yi to estimate θ. Suppose that a convex loss function is used to measure precision of estimation. Then Jensen’s inequality implies that loss using the nonrandomized estimate μN is
smaller than expected loss using the randomized estimate. See Hodges and Lehmann
(1950).
Research on consensus forecasts has largely disregarded the result as it has sought to
explain why mean forecasts perform better than individual forecasts. A notable exception is McNees (1992), who exposited the matter clearly in the context of absolute and
square loss. He also recognized the consensus-forecasting version of result (4); that is,
the median forecast of any event must be at least as close to the truth as at least half of
the individual forecasts, whatever the truth may be. McNees (1992, p. 705) observed that
much research on forecasting did not acknowledge “these simple, well-known, yet often
ignored arithmetic principles.”
More recently, Larrick and Soll (2006) referred to the application of Jensen’s inequality to consensus forecasting as the “averaging principle” and reported experimental research showing that a majority of their student subjects did not understand the principle. Thus, the power of Jensen’s inequality may be plain in abstraction but not as evident
in application.

7. Conclusion
The simple analysis of this paper adds to our understanding of how human heterogeneity may affect social choices. In the introduction to his Nobel Prize lecture, Sen
(1999, p. 349) pointed to heterogeneity as the core problem of social choice theory, writing:
If there is a central question that can be seen as the motivating issue that inspires social
choice theory, it is this: how can it be possible to arrive at cogent aggregative judgments
about the society. . . , given the diversity of preferences, concerns, and predicaments of the
different individuals within the society?

A substantial part of research in social choice theory, including much of Sen’s work, focuses on distributional issues stemming from heterogeneity in “predicaments.” The vexing problem driving the modern study of voting mechanisms initiated by Arrow (1951)
is the generic absence of a coherent collective preference ordering over actions when
individual preferences over actions are heterogeneous.
The broad message of this paper is that analysis of social choice under uncertainty
requires specific attention to heterogeneity in individual beliefs and decision criteria.
A classical utilitarian argument holds that when agents have heterogeneous preferences
over private actions, collective choice of a single action prevents persons from exercising their preferences and, hence, creates deadweight loss. However, this argument
was developed in the study of deterministic settings where heterogeneity in preferences
over actions can stem only from heterogeneity in choice sets or objective functions. The
present analysis has shown that the classical argument does not hold in certain settings
of choice under uncertainty with heterogeneous beliefs or decision criteria. The extent
to which this conclusion extends to other uncertainty settings is an open question.
