ESTIMATINGMARGINALTREATMENTEFFECTS INHETEROGENEOUS POPULATIONS 241

Introduction
The possible existence of individual heterogeneity in the effectof a treatmenton
outcomes in a population has been a focus ofmuch work in the causal effects lit
erature. In economics, heterogeneity in the effectof a binary endogenous regressor
was introduced in the literatureon switching regressionmodels by Quandt [1972],
Heckman [1978], and Lee [1979], while in the statistics literature the causal model
of potential outcomes of Rubin (1974) also allows full heterogeneity in treatment
effects.This heterogeneity was reformulated as a random coefficient by Heckman
and Robb [1985] and by Bj?rklund andMoffitt [1987]. The latterpaper also intro
duced the concept of themaiginal treatmenteffect (termed the 'marginal gain') in
the context of a multivariate-normal switching regression model and showed that
themodel was observationally equivalent to the Lee switching regression model.
Imbens andAngrist [1994] showed that the treatmenteffect ina heterogeneous pop
ulation across two points in the distribution, termed theLocal Average Treatment

Effect (LATE), could be nonparametrically estimated with instrumentalvariables
(IV) and Angrist et al. [1996] elaborated and clarified thismethod. Heckman and
Vytlacil
[1999, 2005] have clarified the distinctions between themarginal treat
ment effect (MTE), theLATE, and other treatmenteffects of interest.
In this paper, we build upon a remark by Heckman and Vytlacil
[2005, p.691]
that the treatmenteffectsmodel with heterogeneous effects of a binary treatment
implies that outcomes are a nonlinear function of participation probabilities. A
model is set up in this paper which demonstrates thatpoint in a slightly reformu
lated random coefficientsmodel which makes minimal identifyingassumptions for
the identificationof thenonlinearity.A simple series estimationmethod is proposed
to nonparametrically estimate the shape of the outcome-participation-probability
relationship, and hence marginal returns to treatment,which can be implemented
with widely-available software packages.
An empirical illustration is provided for the effect of a binary higher education
et al.
indicator on earnings in theUK using the data from a study by Blundell
[2005]. The literatureon the effect of education on earnings has seen the largest
number of discussions of heterogeneity in the return,a concept discussed in the
Woytinsky Lecture of Becker (1975) and inMincer [1974], Surveys of the empiri
cal literatureby Card [1999,2001] have emphasized the impact of possible hetero
geneity in the returnon the interpretationof the estimates in that literature(see also
Lang [1993]). The largemajority of these estimates use only a binary instrument
and hence only one piece of themarginal return function can be nonparametrically
identified,whereas in thispaper a wider portion of the return function is estimated
because multiple, multi-valued instruments are used. Carneiro et al. [2003] and
Aakvik et al. [2005] also obtained a wider range of estimates of the return function
but partly because of parametric assumptions; however, Carneiro et al. [2006]
used a wide range of instruments to nonparametrically estimate the full range of
returns to education, similar to the exercise here. Oreopoulos

The next section lays out themodel and estimation method and the subsequent
section provides the illustration.A summary appears at the end.

1 Estimation of the Heterogeneous
Effects Model
The model presented here is adapted from those in the treatmenteffects literature
referenced in the Introduction. Let y. be an outcome variable for individual /,D.
a dummy variable signifying participation in the program, and Z. an instrumental
variable with a multinomial distribution.An unrestrictedmodel, assuming no other
covariates, can be written as

(1) *
(2)

?, "A

,)

(3)A=1(D;>0)
where ?. and a. are scalar random parameters and . is a vector of random param
eters.All parameters are allowed to be individual-specific and to have some unre
stricted joint distributiony(?., a-, ;); thus a separate model (l)-(3) exists for each
individual. The function k is likewise unrestricted and hence themodel forD. can
.
be saturated inZp though restrictions on will
be necessary for interpretation(see

a description of how y. varies with D. in any particular population; hence a. and
its distribution is the object of interest1.There are two sources of possible selec

(those with different
unobserved participation propensities have different levels of y in the absence of

the treatment).

Assumptions Al andA2 aremean independence assumptions needed forZ. to be
a valid exclusion restriction.Eqn (6) states that themean of the random intercept
must be independent of Z. (individuals must have the same level ofy in the absence
of treatmentfor all values of Z). Eqn (7) states that themean 'gain' from the treat
ment among those who participate must depend on Z. only through thefraction
treated and not otherwise. If a. covaries with &p a change inZ. will alter the types
of individuals who participate and themean of a. among participants will change.
For example, in the usual positive selection case, as participation in a treatment
expands, those brought into the treatmenthave smaller positive a. than thosewho
have already participated, and themean a. among participants will fall.At different
levels of Zp therefore, thatmean will vary.
The existing literatureusually assumes, instead of A2, thatboth potential out
comes arefolly independent of Z. and therefore that theirdifference, a., is also folly
independent of Z.; however, because Z. enters theD. equation, the distribution of ay
in theD. = 1 subpopulation is dependent on Zf through theprobability of participa
tion in that case (assuming a. covaries with ,.),so (A2) holds. But A2 is a slightly
weaker condition than full independence because it states thatonly themean of a,
on theparticipa
in theD. = 1 subpopulation need be independent of
Zp conditional
tion probability. This condition is stated as a primitive rather than deriving itfrom
other assumptions2.
To interpretthe estimates of marginal treatmenteffects estimated below as the
mean a. of thosewho change participation, we also need a "monotonicity" assump
tion originally formulated by Imbens and Angrist (1994):

where Dt(Z. = z) is the function described in (2)-(3). This assumption constitutes
a restriction on the distribution of . (see also Heckman and Vytlacil, 2005, for a
discussion).
With these assumptions, and lettingF(Z?) = E(D.\Z?), (4) and (5) can be rewritten
as

2. Inmost applications, full independence may hold in any case. But theremay be applications where
the variation in the participation rate induced by the instrument is located only in one part of the alpha
distribution, and one may have more confidence in the similarity of thatpart of the distribution across
values of the instrument than in other parts of the alpha distribution.

participation (F) on y varies with the level of participation because g is a function
ofF, thus inducing an inherentnonlinearity of y inF, a feature of heterogeneous
treatmenteffectsmodels noted by Heckman and Vytlacil [2005, p. 691] and also
discussed inHeckman et ai [2006]. A homogeneous-effects model is one inwhich
g is a constant.
Nonparametric identificationof theparameters of (9) and (10) is straightforward
given thatD. isbinary and Z. has amultinomial distribution.F(Z.) is identifiedat each

that

the literatureand originally emphasized by Imbens and Angrist [1994], not all ele
ments can be identified if the support of Z. in the sample does not generate full sup
port ofF from 0 to 1.For two ormore points in the support ofF, the local average
treatmenteffectbetween two participation fractionsF. and F

is thediscrete slope

betweenthosepoints,Ay/AF=
[Fyg(Fy) Ffg(Ff )] /(Fy Ff ).

The marginal treatmenteffect at some point F. is instead the continuous derivative,
dy/dF= gf(Fj)Fj + g(Fy), which must be obtained by some smoothing method
given themultinomial assumption on Zr If the support of F contains the value 0,
the effect of the treatmenton the treated, is likewise identified at all other
giFj),

points in the support ofF3. IfF
support, the

average treatmenteffect,g(l), is thereforealso identified.
Nonparametric estimation of the g functionwill be conducted here by series
estimation methods rather than with kernel methods4. Series estimation meth
ods, whether by power functions or spline functions, are easily implemented in
conventional regression packages because theymerely involve adding additional
regressors to a linearmodel. Here, (9) simply becomes a linear regression model
with regressors that are nonlinear inF(Z). Estimation of (10) is possible in several
differentways. For example, (9) and (10) could be jointly estimated with nonlin
ear least squares, allowing for heteroskedasticity (particularly in (10)) and for a
nonzero across-equation error covariance5. However, here, instead, themore tradi
tional two-stepmethod will be employed, using first-stage estimates based on pro
bit estimation ofF(Z) followed by second-stage estimation of (9) using predicted
values of F as regressors. Robust standard errors correcting for estimation error
inF and for the nonlinearity of F in (9) are obtained by applying formulas from
Newey andMcFadden
[1994, eqn (6.11)]6.
Adding a vector of exogenous observables X.9 themodel becomes:

(11)y^aPt + hfiQ
(12)
3. The effect of the treatment on the treated as defined here is conditional on z; however, by integrating
out, the effect unconditional on can be obtained.
4. Carneiro et al [2006] add a vector of X variables and apply the partially-linear model to estimate
g(F)F by kernel methods, for example.
5. Earlier versions of this paper used mis method.
6. The normality restriction on F could be relaxed by applying a more nonparametric estimation pro
cedure to the first stage. Note

that the linear probability model would

be inappropriate if itwere

to

predictnegativeprobabilities(in theapplicationbelow, itdoes so), for itwould notbe sensibleto
provide estimates of g at negative values of F.

as noted above. Note that,even with its linear index restrictions,thismodel allows
an interactionofX with the effectof treatmenton y as long as

is a departure frommost IV practice7.Note as well that theparametric nature of the
model will allow estimation of theentiredistributionofg, since both power functions
and splines can be extrapolated beyond the range ofF(Z) in thedata. However, itwill
be importantto note that these estimates are the resultof extrapolation and that the
estimates of g within the range ofF in thedata are presumably more reliable.

as well (as inmuch of the literature) on the effectof a discrete change in education
from less-than-college to college-or-more. The education-earnings literature is the
literaturewhere heterogeneity in returnshas been discussed most heavily, as noted
in the Introduction. As to whether theMTE for the return to college should be
expected to rise or fall as a largerfraction of individuals go to college, thisdepends,
as always, on thenature of the instrumentand how the conditional mean of a (usu
ally interpretedas arising from unobserved ability) varies with that instrument.The
usual practice in the literature is to seek instrumentswhich proxy, or are correlated
with, costs of schooling. In this case, theBecker Woytinsky Lecture model implies
that theMTE will fall if costs fall and participation expands as the lower-return
individuals are drawn into any given level of schooling. Therefore, thatwill be the
prior for the empirical exercise conducted here8.

It is also worth noting that the empirical literature to date has generally found
OLS estimates of the return to be below IV estimates, where the latter are inter
pretable as LATE or, in continuous terms, as theMTE (Card, [1999,2001]). One
possible explanation of this result (see Card as well as Angrist and Krueger
[1999, pp. 1324-1325]) is that an instrumentmay affect different individuals in
the population in differentways and may affect those with highMTE values dis
proportionately. The same result applies in themodel in (l)-(3) above because that
model allows unobserved heterogeneity in ..This is formally shown inAppendix
A, where it is demonstrated that, for theMTE to be greater thanOLS, it is neces
sary that theMTE also be greater than the TT (effect of treatmenton the treated).
However, it is also shown there thatOLS must nevertheless be greater than the
TT and, in addition, theMTE be larger than the TT or OLS in the neighbourhood
differ
of F = 0 or F = 1. Therefore, a test of this explanation for theMTEOLS
ence is available if the instrumentsprovide variation in those ranges of F, which
are also necessary to obtain an estimate of the TT. We will illustrate this in the
application.

et ai
Application. For our application, we use the data employed in Blundell
[2005], who estimated the effect of higher education on earnings in theUK in
19939. The data set consisted of informationon 3,639 males whose earnings were
observed at age 33 in 1993, and whose families had been interviewed periodically
since birth to collect child and family background information.The regressor of
interestwas a dummy variable indicating whether the individual had undertaken
some form of higher education, and a set of other socioeconomic characteristics
were available foruse as control variables. The OLS estimate of the effectof higher
education on the log of thehourlywage was .287. The authors obtained IV estimates
with three variables used as instruments: (1) a dummy variable forwhether the
parents reported an adverse financial shock at either age 11 or age 16 of the child,
(2) a dummy variable forwhether the child's teacher ranked the parent's "inter
est in education" high or low when the child was 7, and (3) the number of older
siblings of the child (the total number of siblings was used as a control variable in
8. It should be noted that the relationship of interest here is how theMTE changes as thefraction of the
population with a fixed level of schooling increases, which differs slightly from the standard textbook
analysis. The usual Becker-Woytinsky diagram, which portrays returns vs the level of schooling,
must be analyzed with a vertical line drawn at the fixed level of schooling. A shift in themarginal
cost curve then has the effects just noted. This is somewhat different than the question of whether the

thewage regression). The authors argued that these variables could be excluded
from thewage equation and noted that theyhave high F-statistics in thefirst-stage
regression. In this paper, we do not question the credibility of the instrumentsbut
take theirvalidity as a maintained assumption in order to illustrate the estimation
method, which is ourmain interest.Blundell et al. found IV estimates of the return
to higher education to fall in a very wide range (.05, 1.17) for the three different
instruments, and made a priori arguments forwhy different instruments should
have differenteffects, depending on their correlation with unobserved returns and
costs in thepopulation10.
Here we use the same data as Blundell et al. and estimate a slightly condensed
model with fewerX variables, excluding those with coefficients of low signifi
cance and condensing categories (e.g., region) where coefficient differences are
of low significance. The means of the variables in the data set are shown in
Appendix B, along with theOLS regressions, which generate an estimate of the
effect of higher education of .287 (robust s.e. = .02), identical to thatof Blundell
et al. We then estimate our models using all three instruments (Z). The litera
ture has noted that different instrumentsmay sweep out different portions of
the returndistribution and hence may have differentMTEs (Imbens and Angrist
et
[1994]; Card [1999,2001]; Heckman and Vytlacil
[2005]; see also Blundell
al. for a discussion focused on these three instruments), inwhich case theMTE
estimates from a model which includes all instrumentsmust be interpreted as
in those different populations. However, differ
weighted averages of theMTEs
ent instrumentsmay also simply sweep out different ranges of theF distribution,
and thiswill also generate different estimates of theMTE when the instruments
are used separately ifheterogeneity exists and hence theMTE is a function of F.
to sweep out the same portion of the return
The method used here assumes each
to operate in a different portion of
distribution at the same F but allows each
theF distribution, which will generate a different value of theMTE for each
for this reason alone. In principle, itwould be possible to testwhether the three
instruments generate different estimates of the return to education at the same F
if the supports ofF generated by the instrumentsoverlap, but this is not done here
because themethodological goal is best served bymaximizing the range ofF and
that is achieved by using all three instruments together. In practice, the results
can be interpreted as weighted averages as discussed in the articles referenced
above.

Column (1) shows estimates of a model with just a constant in (21)-(22),
equivalent to the homogeneous-effects model. The estimate of .33 is slightly
above theOLS estimate, consistent with much of the literature (estimates of the
other parameters in themodel are shown in Table B2, Appendix B).
Figure 1 shows a histogram of predicted participation rates from the esti
mated first-stage equation and indicates a concentration of probabilities in the
lower ranges of F and with sizable fractions of the data at higher probabilities
as well, although the distribution becomes thin above .70. However, most of
this variation is generated by variation inX9 and the relevant issue for this
model is instead the incremental effect of the instruments on these probabili
ties. The coefficients on the instruments are generally significant (see Table
B2, Appendix B) and have an F-statistic of 18 in a nonlinear least squares
estimation of the first-stage equation and an F-statistic of 13 if a linear first
stage equation is estimated, within the rule-of-thumb ranges for small numbers
of instruments (Stock and Yogo, [2005])12. Figure 2 shows a box plot of the
incremental effect of the instruments on the spread of predicted F, where the
"baseline" F is obtained by setting the values of the instruments equal to their
means but allowing X to vary, and the "actual" F is obtained by allowing both
and X to vary. The instruments provide quite a bit of additional variation in
themiddle ranges of the probabilities (e.g., .30 to .70) but very little additional
variation at both low and high values ofF. This is an important result because it
demonstrates that, despite the concentration of the overall predicted probabili
ties in the region around F = 0, the instruments have very little power in that
region. They have more power in the higher regions, but there is also relatively
little data in those regions. The region where there is both a reasonable fraction
of the data and where the instruments have relevance is in the relatively narrow
region of approximately (.30, .60). These remarks also suggest that, formodels
with effect heterogeneity, instruments can be strong in some regions of F but
weak in other regions, a feature not generally noted in the weak instruments
literature13.

sophisticated spline methods which address some of these features, such as
methods which allow estimation of the knot points and which allow derivatives to be continuous at
knot points (eg., de Boor [2001]).
12. Almost 10 percent of predicted F values from the linear probability model are negative. As noted
earlier, thismakes it inappropriate for the purpose of this exercise.

The restof the columns inTable 1 show thedegree of nonlinearitywith respect to
F using splines and polynomials. Column (2) allows theg function to vary linearly
with F and indicates that the treatmenteffect declines as F rises and more of the
population is engaged in higher education. This is therefore consistent with the
prior. Column (3) adds a spline knot at the 50th percentile point of the predicted
F distribution, showing that the standard errors on the nonlinear F parameters
increasemarkedly and theparameters reach implausible magnitudes in some ranges.
Column (4) adds two furthersplines showing parameters that,while retaining
significance at conventional levels, reach furtherimplausible magnitudes. Column
a
(5) shows the effect of adding one additional polynomial term, quadratic inF
(which implies that logwages are cubic inF) and shows no significant evidence of
higher nonlinearity. Taken as a whole, these estimates do not provide evidence of
any reliably-estimated nonlinearities beyond thefirstorder, although thereare hints
in the spline results of some convexity in the function14.
The rapid decline in the stability of the estimates as additional nonlinearities are
introduced could simply reflect the truth; that is, there are indeed no higher-order
nonlinearities. In fact, the functiong which isbeing estimated is equal to the conven
tionalHeckman normal lambda term if the unobservables aremultivariate normal,
and that term is known to be approximately linear in the probability of selection,
at least in themiddle range of probabilities. However, there are two other, related,
sources of instability in thehigher-order nonlinear terms.The more important is the
already-noted weakness of the instrumentsinhigh and low ranges ofF; instruments
which have littleor no effect on F in those regions should be expected to generate
unstable and implausible values. Figures 3 and 4 plot theg function (treatmenton

15. To ascertain whether stronger instrumentswould affect the results, Monte Carlos were conducted
assuming the coefficients on the three instrumentswere double and then triplewhat they are shown
to be inAppendix B, Table B-2. All coefficients in the^vector were assumed to equal what they
were estimated to be in thatmodel, and 500 repetitions of multivariate normal errors were drawn
with nonzero correlations to generate heterogeneity, for a sample size of 3639 and the same X and
theMonte Carlo estimates of gamma were, on average, the

same regardless of themagnitude of the coefficients on the instruments, the standard errors and
confidence intervals for gamma were dramatically lower when the coefficients were double or triple
what they are here.

A second, related factor is that the instruments,while generating more than the
single variation in predicted F that is allowed with only a binary instrument,nev
ertheless generate only a limited set of values. Two of the three instruments are
binary and the third (number of older siblings) is concentrated in only threevalues
(0,1, and 2). Thus the number of discrete points of support in the incremental pre
dicted F distribution is stillmodest. Adding parameters to themodel by introducing
spline and polynomial termsnecessarily requires a sufficient range of instruments
to support estimation of those parameters, and that rangemay still not be sufficient
with these instruments. In estimates not reported here, interactions between the
three instrumentsand nonlinearities in the third instrumentwere added to thefirst
stage equation to generate a greater range of incrementalF contributions, but those
additional interactions and nonlinearities were extremely weak. The F statistic for
five instrumentsfalls to 9, and amore extensive set of interactions leading tofifteen
instrumentsyields anF statistic of 4. Tests of interactions of the initial three instru
ments with thevariables in the vector leads toF values of 2 or 3. The instruments
in these data are therefore tooweak to obtain more variation inpredicted probabili
ties and therefore a wider range of probabilities over which to estimate nonlinear

On the central issue ofwhether the

and thereforeof heterogeneous treatmenteffects in the population. Figure 5 shows
a 95 percent confidence interval for theMTE in themost stably estimated model,
thatwith a linearly decliningMTE. Although the confidence intervalswould allow
a horizontal line in some regions, the intervals are narrow enough tomake such
horizontality very unlikely.

gests that theunobservable heterogeneity in returnfound in theTable 1 resultsmay

by an inspection of the results, the interaction coefficients for the largemajority

insignificance ofmost of the interaction termsmay also be related, once again, to
weaknesses in the instruments in generating sufficient incremental effects on theF
distribution for differentvalues ofX. Furtherwork is needed on these issues.

3 Summary and Conclusions
We have proposed a method of estimating the shape of themarginal return func
tion in the treatment-effectsmodel when heterogeneous returns are present, and
have applied themethod to the data from a prior study of the effect of higher
education on earnings ofmen in theUK. The application shows significant effects
of heterogeneity, indicating thatmarginal returns to higher education fall as the
proportion of the population with higher education rises. This direction of effect
is consistent with theBecker Woytinsky Lecture model. However, the instruments
used are weak in some ranges of theF distribution and hence these findings apply
to only a limited range of theparticipation-rate spectrum. Estimating a wide range
ofmarginal treatmenteffects puts greater demands on the instruments than is the
case for either a binary instrumentor the average treatmenteffect obtained when
estimating a single IV coefficientwith multi-valued instruments.The results also
reveal some uncertainty regarding the relative contributions of observables and
unobservables to the heterogeneity thathas been found. These topics suggest fur
therwork on more formalmethods of addressing these issues.
