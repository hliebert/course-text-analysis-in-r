Abstract
I argue for thinking of program evaluation as a decision problem. There are two steps.
First, a counselor determines which program (treatment or control) each individual
joins, based for example on maximizing the probability of employment or expected
earnings. Second, the policymaker decides whether: to assign all individuals to treatment or
to control, or to allow the counselor to choose. This framework has two advantages.
Individualized assignment rules (known as proﬁling) can raise the average impact, improving
cost effectiveness by exploiting treatment-impact heterogeneity. Second, it accounts systematically for inequality and uncertainty, and the policymaker’s attitude toward these, in the
evaluation.

1. Introduction
This paper re-examines the Alameda portion of the Greater Avenues for
Independence (GAIN) program with the aim of offering new methodological
perspectives on program evaluation. Program evaluation is carried out by comparing
the values of a range of outcomes of interest for a treatment and a control

group, typically by considering the average treatment effect and its statistical
signiﬁcance.1 For example, compared with the alternative—Aid to Families with
Dependent Children (AFDC)—the GAIN program has a positive but not
statistically signiﬁcant average treatment effect on earnings and the probability of
employment. Usually, the average treatment effect is also considered for subsets of
the sample, deﬁned based on pre-treatment characteristics.
The methodology that I adopt differs because it models program evaluation
as a decision problem, and allows us to go beyond the average treatment
effect along three dimensions. First, I consider how the program being
evaluated will be made available subsequent to the evaluation. For example, will
all individuals be required to participate in either the treatment program or the
control program? These are the two options normally considered in evaluations. I
also allow for the possibility that a counselor (caseworker in the context of welfare
programs) can decide to which program—treatment or control—each individual will
be assigned. This is a reasonable option to consider, because the practice of proﬁling
program participants in order to determine receipt of services has become
widespread (for example, in unemployment insurance, see Berger et al., 2001; and
Runner, 1996).
Second, in choosing among the available options—which at this point
include treatment, control, and assignment by a caseworker—I pay particular
attention to how uncertainty about the outcome of interest affects the choice among
programs. It is well known that a t-statistic does not embody all of the information
relevant for a rational decisionmaker.2 I therefore use predictive distributions—
distributions which capture all of the uncertainty about the outcome of interest—
which then allow for the use of standard expected utility theory in comparing the
distribution of outcomes under the available programs. Finally, I allow for the
policymaker to exhibit inequality aversion, which also entails looking beyond the
average treatment effect.
Such issues have been largely ignored in the evaluation literature, with a few
notable exceptions. Heckman and Smith (1998) (see also Heckman et al., 1997)
rigorously consider the data requirements for evaluating various social welfare
functions. Within the framework of their paper, the current paper focuses on social
welfare functions that do not require information on the joint distribution of
earnings under treatment and control. Manski (1999) (also Manski, 1995) develops
non-parametric bounds for the expected welfare from different post-evaluation
1

In randomized trials, such comparisons give unbiased estimates of the treatment effect (see Fisher
(1935) and Neyman (1935)). In a non-experimental setting, the comparison would have to control for
potential sources of sample selection bias. See, inter alia, Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002), Heckman
(1989, 1990, 1992), Heckman and Hotz (1989), Heckman and Robb (1985, 1986), Heckman et al. (1998),
Heckman and Smith (1995), Lalonde (1986), Manski (1989, 1993), and Manski and Garﬁnkel (1992).

The ﬁnance literature has made a similar point in a very different context. See Kandel and Stambaugh
(1996). In addressing the question ‘‘Are stock market returns predictable and does it matter?’’, they argue
that rather than formulating the question in terms of the statistical signiﬁcance of the relevant parameters
in an econometric model, one should look at the impact of such predictability on the portfolio decision of
interest. See also Barberis (2000) and Chamberlain (2000).

assignment rules, and Manski (2000) extends the analysis to the case where the
policymaker’s objective is not well deﬁned. Both of his papers are complementary to
the current research, because they explore related issues using non-Bayesian
econometrics or non-standard decision theory. The contribution of this paper is
that it offers an approach that uniﬁes an analysis of individual-level heterogeneity
with an analysis of the impact of risk and inequality aversion at the level of the
policymaker.
Using the GAIN data, I demonstrate that the methodological contributions
just outlined are important in understanding the impact of the GAIN treatment.
I show ﬁrst that a caseworker who maximizes participants’ postassignment probability of employment will assign less than half of the
individuals into GAIN. In terms of the evaluation, this implies that the policy of
assignment by a caseworker yields higher average post-assignment earnings
than either of the other two policies (assigning all individuals into either GAIN or
AFDC) that are normally considered. When it is selectively available through a
caseworker, GAIN emerges as viable in a cost–beneﬁt sense as well; this overturns
the traditional evaluation of the program. More generally, whenever there is
heterogeneity in the treatment impact, allowing for assignment by a caseworker will
be of central interest.
Further, I show that the evaluation of the GAIN program changes signiﬁcantly
when one consistently accounts for uncertainty. In particular, the ranking that
emerges between policies—for example, that assignment by a caseworker dominates
GAIN, which in turn dominates AFDC, in terms of post-assignment earnings—is
economically signiﬁcant in the sense that the predictive distribution of earnings
under one program ﬁrst-order stochastically dominates the earnings distribution
under the other program. In contrast, the ranking that emerges from a more
standard t-test on the difference in means is equivocal; the difference is positive but
not statistically signiﬁcant.3 Finally, I show that allowing for inequality aversion
changes the ranking between GAIN and AFDC, with the latter preferred for
moderately inequality-averse preferences.
GAIN is an interesting program to study not only because it is very similar
to California’s current welfare program (CalWORKs) but also because
similar welfare-to-work programs have been initiated by many states since the
1980s (Greenberg and Wiseman, 1992, survey 24 such programs). At another level,
GAIN is one in a long line of social experiments (see Burtless (1995) for a recent
survey) and methodological conclusions about evaluating GAIN will be broadly
relevant.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 brieﬂy describes the GAIN program
and experiment. Section 3 describes the econometric model that I use. Section 4
3

A highly relevant issue that I do not discuss here is: to what extent can one extrapolate the result to
other populations of interest and to other time periods? When treatment effects are estimated at the
individual level, one can, in principle, extrapolate to other populations to the extent that they have the
same support in the space of pre-treatment variables as the original sample (assuming ignorable
assignment). If the model is suitably speciﬁed, one can also extrapolate through time. See Dehejia (2003)
and Hotz et al. (1999).

examines the decision problems for two typical individuals. Section 5 discusses the
social decision problem and the choice of social welfare functions. Section 6
examines the results of the model at the social level, and Section 7 concludes the
paper.

2. The GAIN program and the GAIN experiment
The GAIN program began operating in California in 1986, with the
aim of ‘‘increasing employment and fostering self-sufﬁciency’’ among AFDC
recipients (see Riccio et al., 1994). In 1988, six counties—Alameda, Butte, Los
Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, and Tulare—were chosen for an experimental
evaluation of the beneﬁts of GAIN. In this paper, we will conﬁne ourselves to the
Alameda County portion of the data. A companion paper (Dehejia, 2003) examines
all six counties and the issues that arise in evaluating programs implemented across
multiple sites.
A subset of AFDC recipients (single parents with children aged six or
older and unemployed heads of two-parent households) were required to
participate in the GAIN experiment. For its evaluation, Alameda further
conﬁned itself to long-term welfare recipients (individuals already having received
welfare for 2 years or more).4 As a result, the chronology of the data and subsequent
results is in experimental time, rather than calendar time. No sanctions were used if
individuals failed to attend the orientation sessions. However, once individuals
started in the GAIN program, sanctions were used to ensure their ongoing
participation.
At the time of enrollment into the program, a variety of background
characteristics was recorded for both treatment and control units, including:
demographic characteristics, results of a reading and mathematics proﬁciency
test, and data on 10 quarters of pre-treatment earnings. Table 1 summarizes
the characteristics of the Alameda sample: 85 percent are women, who on
average have more than two children; the mean level of education is
grade 10; a quarter have previously participated in training programs; the
average level of pre-treatment earnings is low, ranging from $150 to $190
per quarter, but because 87 percent of pre-treatment earnings are zero, the
average of non-zero pre-treatment earnings is higher, on the order of $1110 per
quarter.5
Of those who attended the orientation session, half were randomly assigned into
the GAIN program. These individuals continue to receive AFDC beneﬁts, but face
additional requirements and receive additional services (described below). The other

This implies that the Ashenfelter (1978) ‘‘dip’’ in earnings cannot be observed in pre-assignment
earnings.

Seven individuals are excluded from the original sample because of apparent coding errors in their
covariates. These seven individuals are either coded as having 70 children or a previous hourly wage of
more than $300.

Of course, these individuals could participate in non-GAIN employment-creating activities. The
existence of non-GAIN activities is important in interpreting the treatment effect from GAIN. The
treatment effect measures the increase in earnings, employment, etc., from the availability of, and
encouragement (or requirement) to use, GAIN-related services compared with pre-existing employment
services. To the extent that both groups receive AFDC beneﬁts, the comparison is between the presence
and absence of supplementary services and requirements.

assignment covariates is balanced across the treatment and control groups; Table 1
lists each of the covariates. In terms of the chronology of data gathering,
‘‘experimental’’ time (which I also refer to as post-assignment time) begins when
individuals attend the GAIN orientation session. The early stages of post-assignment
time thus coincide with the education and training part of the GAIN program.7
There are several components to the GAIN treatment: basic education, for those
deemed to be in need of it (this includes either preparation for the General Educational
Development certiﬁcate, Adult Basic Education, or English as a Second Language);
job search; and job training, for those who do not ﬁnd jobs (includes on-the-job
training and paid or unpaid work experience). Participants were exempted from the
requirement to participate in GAIN activities if they found work on their own.8
The outcome that we consider is earnings, which is observed for 13 quarters
following assignment to treatment. From Tables 2 and 3, we see that GAIN’s impact
on both earnings and the probability of employment is negative in the ﬁrst quarter;
this is not surprising, since treatment units are participating in training activities in
the ﬁrst quarter. The treatment effect subsequently increases, ranging from 2 to 4
percent for the probability of employment and $200 for earnings (both are
statistically signiﬁcant).9
Finally, we should note that the assumption of a constant treatment effect across
all individuals is very restrictive. The average treatment effect potentially embodies
an array of heterogeneous treatment effects. Two examples illustrate this point. Fig.
1 depicts the interaction between the treatment effect and the score on the reading
test: individuals who score 200 or more enjoy a higher treatment effect, although the
standard error is quite large. In Fig. 2, we see that individuals who have previously
participated in training programs also enjoy a higher treatment effect. Although
these interactions are not statistically signiﬁcant, we will see that they have a
substantial impact on the decision problem.10
7

More precisely, individuals were registered in the ﬁrst quarter of experimental time. This means that in
some cases the ﬁrst quarter of experimental time in fact includes information from 1 or 2 months prior to
the commencement of the experiment. For example, for an individual who attended an orientation session
in February 1989, the ﬁrst quarter of experimental time is from January to March 1989. Of course, some
part of the ﬁrst and second quarters could be spent participating in treatment activities. Pre-assignment
data would cover the 10 quarters from July 1986 to December 1988.
8
Only about 85 percent of the treated units actively participated in any GAIN activities; the balance
satisﬁed the requirements of the GAIN program on their own (in most cases by ﬁnding employment within
the ﬁrst two or three quarters of experimental time). Thus, as observed earlier, this is important in
interpreting the treatment effect as the impact of the GAIN program as a whole rather than the
components of the treatment, because some portion of the impact is through participants who ﬁnd work in
order to avoid the burden of participating in treatment activities. See Black et al. (1999).
9
An earlier version of this paper (Dehejia 1997) examines the impact of lagged employment status on
the treatment impact, and shows that the treatment increases the probability of transition from nonemployment to employment. For a more detailed analysis of this issue, see Ashenfelter and Card (1985)
and Eberwein et al. (1997).
10
It is well known that statistical signiﬁcance is not the criterion that a rational decisionmaker considers
in choosing between alternatives. For example, in the ﬁnance literature, Barberis (2000) notes that the
predictability of stock market returns is not statistically signiﬁcant, yet it is sufﬁcient to inﬂuence an
agent’s portfolio choice (relative to bonds) over a sufﬁciently long horizon.

A probit is used; covariates include variables for the number of children, reading and writing test scores,
grade, age, sex, ethnicity, and earnings histories. The treatment effect is computed as the discrete difference
between the probability of unemployment with the treatment indicator set to 0 and 1, where the value of
other covariates is set to their sample mean. The delta method is used to compute standard errors.

GAIN, and Yi0t as her earnings if she was in AFDC; obviously one of these is
counter-factual. Thus, observed earnings are deﬁned as:
Yit ¼ Ti Yi1t þ ð1  Ti ÞYi0t ;

ð1Þ

where Ti is a treatment indicator (=1 if individual i was in fact assigned to GAIN,
and =0 if she was assigned to AFDC). Realizations of the random variable are
denoted in lower case, yit.
A key feature of the distribution of earnings, which inﬂuences the model choice
and was highlighted in Section 2, is the mass point in the distribution of earnings at
zero. The strategy adopted is to use a censored normal likelihood, the Tobit model.

The vector of explanatory variables is given by xit=(11 it,y,113 it, [11 ity113 it]  Ti, Zi,
Zi  Ti, Rit). [11 ity113 it] is a set of indicator variables for each quarter of postassignment time (1k it=1 if t=k, =0 otherwise), giving each period its own intercept.
The treatment indicator is interacted with [11 ity113 it]. Since each period
corresponds to experimental, rather than calendar, time, the treatment dummies
produce a proﬁle of the treatment effect over 13 quarters. Exogenous regressors, Zi
and their interactions with the treatment indicator are also included, which allow the
treatment effect to vary with observable pre-treatment characteristics. These
characteristics include: indicators for the age and number of children, race and
ethnicity, educational attainment, score on the reading and mathematics tests, sex,
an indicator for previous participation in other training programs, and 10 periods of
pre-assignment earnings history.11 A calendar time trend, Rit, is also included.12
I use diffuse priors for the parameters of the model. Appendix A discusses the
estimation procedure in detail, and Appendix B summarizes the posterior
distributions of the parameters.
11

A ﬁxed set of pre-assignment earnings is used; thus these are pre-determined rather than autoregressive variables.
12
Note that the earnings process is i.i.d., conditional on covariates. This speciﬁcation allows for
persistent differences in earnings across individuals through the permanent, rather than transitory,
component. The source of heterogeneity is individual exogenous characteristics, which are also interacted
with the treatment indicator. Note also that the model is not interpreted structurally; it is used predictively.
It would be an interesting extension to consider more general speciﬁcations for earnings processes (see, for
example, Hirano, 2000), which might improve predictions to some extent, but for the questions which I
examine the current model produces predictions that are robust to generalizations of the model (e.g., to a
mixture of normals or to allow for additional serial correlation in earnings).

3.2. The predictive distribution
Because the decision problems associated with program evaluation are in the space
of outcomes, not the space of the parameters of the model, it is important to
construct a distribution in the outcome space which embodies all of the uncertainty
from the model (i.e., conditional on parameters) and from parameter estimation.
This is called the (posterior) predictive distribution.
Imagine predicting earnings for an (I+1)st individual. This individual is identiﬁed
by ZIþ1 ; a set of exogenous variables. By specifying the time dummies and the
treatment indicator, we construct xIþ1 t : Conditional on parameters, (b(i),s(i)), we
can simulate the outcome distribution by drawing for YIþ1t (from the likelihood (3),
N(b(i)xit,s(i))). To obtain the predictive distribution, we must account for parameter
uncertainty; thus, we use draws from the posterior distribution of the parameters
(obtained from the Gibbs sampler outlined in the appendix): b(i),s(i)Bp(b,s|Data).
For each draw, we simulate the outcome distribution from the likelihood. Using this
procedure, we obtain the joint predictive distribution of earnings for individual I+1
from periods 1,y,13. To vary the treatment status, we re-specify xit by switching the
treatment indicator.
3.3. The choice and fit of the model
A major issue is the choice of likelihood. The predictive distribution only
captures uncertainty correctly if the model is speciﬁed correctly. Figs. 3 and 4
give a sense of the ﬁt of the model. These ﬁgures show the density of the
empirical distribution of average earnings for treated and control units (estimated
through a histogram), and plot the density of the predictive distribution of average
earnings.
As we can see from the ﬁgures, the empirical distributions of earnings for treated
and control units are well approximated by the truncated normal density. The model
also ﬁts the mass point with reasonable accuracy: an empirical probability of
employment of 0.2047 for treated units compared to a predictive probability of
0.2040, and 0.1852 vs. 0.1756 for control units.13

4. The individual-level impact
This section studies the individual-level impact of the GAIN treatment. It not only
provides a detailed view of the impact of the program, but also lays the foundations
for the analysis in Section 6 of the social welfare problem.
13

A non-parametric model is another option. I use a parametric model because it allows me to
incorporate many explanatory variables, which is important in this application and is difﬁcult in a nonparametric setting. An alternative would be to use a ﬂexibly parametric model. The results would be
similar to those presented here (see, for example, Dehejia, 1999b).

Imagine that a caseworker has to choose whether to assign an individual into
GAIN or AFDC. For the caseworker, an individual is identiﬁed by her preassignment characteristics. Thus, the key assumption is that the individual under
consideration is exchangeable with those in the data; that is, earnings for individuals
with the same covariates are taken to be drawn from the same distribution. A rather
strong implication of this assumption is that the caseworker does not have (or use)
any private information—i.e., information that is not observed by the researcher—in
the assignment decision.14
4.1. Two typical examples
Table 4 shows the pre-treatment covariates of two individuals from the Alameda
County sample for whom we see typical patterns in the distributions of earnings
under treatment and control. Ms. Ten Forty-Three is a clear winner from GAIN,
and Ms. Eight Twenty-Two is a clear loser. Ms. Ten Forty-Three is of age 23, heads
a single-parent household, has one child between the age of 6 and 11, and has
completed high school. Her earnings history shows that she was employed in each of
the quarters prior to the experiment. Ms. Eight Twenty-Two is a 41-year-old woman,
the head of a single-parent household, has one child between the age of 12 and 18,
and has completed high school. Her earnings history shows substantially higher
earnings in all but one of pre-assignment periods. Let us consider each individual in
turn.
Table 5a shows the probability of positive earnings, and the mean and standard
deviation of the predictive distribution of earnings, for each period under both
treatment and control for Ms. Ten Forty-Three. For each of the 13 periods, the
probability of positive earnings and the mean of earnings are higher in the GAIN
treatment than in the control program. The proﬁle of the treatment effect is
increasing, in a pattern similar to that depicted in Table 3 for Alameda County on
average. However, the standard deviation of control earnings is higher than that of
treatment earnings, and the difference between the treatment and control earnings is
small compared with the magnitude of the standard deviation (i.e. there is
substantial overlap in the predictive distributions of earnings).15 Is the difference
between treatment and control earnings signiﬁcant?
Within a decision framework, we could say that the difference is signiﬁcant
if a wide range of decisionmakers would opt for the treatment distribution
over the control distribution. Fig. 5 depicts the cumulative distribution
14
The assumption of exchangeability conditional on covariates is not unique to my application. This
assumption, or some alternative, is needed any time we want to extrapolate from a dataset to a new
situation. If the individual herself is making the choice, but any private information she has is independent
of the observed covariates, then there would be no systematic errors in terms of average earnings for the
group of interest.
15
The difference in means is not signiﬁcant in the sense that the 95 percent probability intervals of the
posterior distributions substantially overlap. But the standard deviation of the predictive distribution is
not very informative, because of the mass point in the distribution. This is another reason to examine the
entire distribution of earnings, which we do below.

functions (CDFs) for the predictive distribution for each of the 13 periods. In
each of the 13 post-assignment periods, treatment earnings ﬁrst-order
stochastically dominate control earnings. Any risk-neutral or risk-averse agent
(whose preferences are increasing in earnings) would prefer the treatment
distribution. This is a simple illustration of the fact that even when the means of
the two distributions under consideration are not very different, the underlying
decision may be clearcut.
For Ms. Eight Twenty-Two, it is a different matter. In Fig. 6 we see that her
distribution of earnings in the control ﬁrst-order stochastically dominates her
distribution of earnings in treatment in each period. As long as more earnings are
preferred to less, the caseworker unambiguously would not assign her to participate
in GAIN. Of course, ﬁrst-order stochastic dominance does not sufﬁce to compare all
the distributions that arise. In general, expected utility comparisons would be
required.
4.2. The importance of accounting for uncertainty
A natural question that arises from the preceding analysis is: would similar
decisions have been reached if uncertainty had not been accounted for as

comprehensively? In particular, one might imagine using the model described
in Section 3 but, rather than using the full posterior distribution of the
parameters, using point estimates and treating them as though they were
the true parameters. Of course, even without parameter uncertainty, the
intrinsic uncertainty embodied in the likelihood (3) has to be taken into account.
Table 5c presents such an exercise for Ms. Three Ninety-Seven, whose characteristics
are given in Table 4. Columns 1–4 of Table 5c present the distribution of her
earnings in each of the 13 quarters, ignoring parameter uncertainty, but still
accounting for the uncertainty conditional on parameters. In contrast, columns 5–8
summarize the posterior distribution of her earnings, in which parameter uncertainty
is accounted for.
The means of the two sets of predictions are broadly similar, as are the
standard deviations, but the sign of the treatment effect is reversed. When
uncertainty is ignored, the mean of predicted control earnings is higher; when we
account for uncertainty, the reverse is true. If the decisionmaker exhibits risk
aversion, then the differences between the two programs are not as extreme. The ﬁnal
row of the table shows that the expected utility (with log preferences) of each
program is the same.

Earnings, Solid=Treatment, Dashed=control
Fig. 6. CDFs of predicted earnings for Ms. Eight Twenty-Two.

Of course, this example was chosen precisely because ignoring uncertainty leads to
different advice than accounting for it. In cases where the two distributions are
starkly different, ignoring uncertainty typically would not lead to a change in the
decision. For the overall sample from Alameda, uncertainty affects decisions for
about 10 percent of individuals.

4.3. The importance of heterogeneity
We could consider such decision problems for a wider array of individuals.
The differences in the results would reﬂect the underlying heterogeneity
in the treatment effect. One view of this is presented in Table 6. Assume
that each of the 1360 individuals in the Alameda sample will be assigned
to either GAIN or AFDC and, as in the previous examples, imagine that the
decision is made by a caseworker based on the predictive distributions of their
earnings in each period under each program. Two criteria are considered:
maximizing the probability of post-assignment employment and assigning to

treatment individuals for whom the expected increase in earnings exceeds the
training costs.16
Table 6 presents the mean of expected post-assignment earnings under GAIN and
AFDC and the mean of pre-assignment covariates. We see that depending on the
criterion either 18 or 56 percent of the sample are faring better under the treatment.
The average treatment effect is $323 ($113) for those (not) assigned to treatment
under the ﬁrst criterion, and $532 ($11) for those (not) treated under the second
criterion. Comparing those assigned to treatment and control for each criterion is
revealing. For both criteria, those beneﬁting from GAIN generally have fewer
16

The GAIN public use ﬁle does not contain information on which services individuals received if they
participated in the treatment. In the absence of this data, we assume that the cost of the GAIN program is
the same across participants, which is estimated at $3638 for 13 quarters (Riccio et al., 1994). Hotz et al.
(2000) obtain data on which treatment participants received.

ARTICLE IN PRESS

children (except under age 4 for the second criterion), have higher scores on the
reading and mathematics tests, have a higher level of educational attainment, are
younger, and often have participated previously in training programs. Of particular
note is the difference in the level of pre-assignment earnings, which are by and large
higher for those beneﬁting from treatment (though Ms. Eight Twenty-Two is an
exception). Comparing the two criteria, we see that those who are assigned to
treatment by the second criterion have on average an even higher level of preassignment earnings, and a greater proportion have previously participated in
training programs (0.8 compared to 0.4).
Table 6 in essence arrives at proﬁles of the beneﬁciaries and non-beneﬁciaries
of GAIN. These proﬁles are not a substitute for individual predictions (as in
Section 4.1) or an overall evaluation (as in Section 6, below). But they do allow
us to generalize to some extent about the attributes of those who beneﬁt from
the treatment. These proﬁles are of great relevance in the contemporary
policy environment, because welfare agencies in fact are now proﬁling program
participants to determine who should receive supplemental services (see inter alia
Berger et al., 2001). The method described in this section achieves this proﬁling in a
systematic manner.

5. The social choice problem
Thus far, the analysis has focused on the individual-level decision between GAIN
and AFDC. This section takes the next step by asking: how can the policymaker
decide which program or combination of programs to make available, given the
pattern of individual effects? There are two steps in this decision.
First is choosing the set of policies under consideration in the postevaluation environment, where policies determine each individual’s assignment
to treatment. I consider the following alternatives: (1) All individuals are required
to participate in GAIN; (2) All individuals remain in AFDC; (3) A caseworker
assigns each individual into the program in which she is most likely to ‘‘succeed’’.
Success is deﬁned by a range of criteria that include the probability of ﬁnding
employment, expected earnings, the increase in earnings net of program costs, and
the expected utility of earnings. I consider two expected utility functions: log and
constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) with the coefﬁcient of relative risk aversion
equal to 3.17 Note that these are the preferences that the caseworker uses to assess
individual earnings.
The second choice is the set of criteria (that is, social welfare functions or SWFs)
that the policymaker uses to decide which policy to adopt. I consider two sets of
alternatives. The ﬁrst set ignores issues of inequality and focuses on outcomes
averaged over the 13 post-assignment periods that are under consideration. These
outcomes include average earnings, the probability of employment, and the increase
17

The literature has suggested a range of values between 0 and 5. Friend and Blume (1975) obtain
indirect evidence from individual asset holdings. They estimate a value between 2 and 3.

ARTICLE IN PRESS
160

in earnings net of program costs.18 In the absence of uncertainty, each SWF would
produce a single number (for example, average earnings) for each program. Because
there is uncertainty, we integrate out the unknown parameters and the intrinsic
uncertainty, producing a predictive distribution of each SWF for each program. In
practice, this amounts to drawing for the outcome from each individual’s predictive
distribution of earnings, computing the SWFs, and repeating this procedure until the
distribution is well approximated.
The second set of SWFs allows for inequality aversion. Four standard SWFs are
considered: utilitarian (the inequality-neutral benchmark); and exponential with
coefﬁcient of inequality aversion ranging from one (log preferences, slightly
inequality averse), to three (intermediate), to inﬁnity (Rawlsian) (see Deaton and
Muellbauer, 1980). For these SWFs, we account for uncertainty by ﬁrst collapsing
each individual’s predictive distribution of earnings in each program to its certainty
equivalent, and then applying the SWFs to the certainty equivalents.19

6. Accounting for risk and inequality aversion
A useful benchmark for the social evaluation of GAIN is the conclusion reached
using differences in means rather than predictive distributions; I consider this below.
Table 7 presents the three social welfare criteria discussed in Section 5. For postassignment earnings and the probability of employment, there is a positive but
insigniﬁcant treatment impact. For earnings net-of-costs, the impact is signiﬁcant.
Tables 8–10 apply the social welfare analysis outlined in Section 5 to the
predictive, rather than the empirical, distributions of outcomes under treatment and
control, allowing for a range of post-evaluation assignment mechanisms. I simulate
the predictive distribution of earnings under treatment and control for 13 quarters of
post-assignment earnings for each of the 1360 individuals in the sample.
Table 8 displays the ﬁrst set of social welfare criteria discussed in Section 5.
Consider ﬁrst average post-assignment earnings per person per quarter. From the
ﬁrst two cells of column 1, the mean predictions from the model ($428 for GAIN and
$340 for AFDC) are similar to those obtained from the empirical distribution, within
$35 for both GAIN and AFDC. The 95 percent posterior conﬁdence intervals do not
overlap. Cells 3–6 show that the policies of assigning individuals based on their
probability of post-assignment employment, or based on expected (or the expected
utility of) earnings, yield substantially higher average quarterly earnings than the
policy of enrolling everyone in GAIN ($478 compared with $428).20 This is not
surprising in light of Table 6, which reveals substantial heterogeneity underlying the

A zero discount rate is assumed, but the results are not sensitive to this choice.

The ﬁndings are sharper than would be obtained from an extreme bounds analysis (see Manski, 1995,
1999, 2000). Of course, the sharper ﬁndings come at a price: the willingness to specify a likelihood model.
But having paid the price, the advantage is a full posterior distribution for the outcomes of interest,
allowing for a richer analysis of individual decisions.

average treatment effect. Even though the heterogeneity may not be statistically
signiﬁcant, it is economically signiﬁcant in the sense that a decisionmaker (with
preferences ranging from risk-neutral to moderately risk-averse) would opt not to
assign a signiﬁcant fraction of the sample to the treatment.
From column 1 of Table 8, it is not possible to determine to what extent the
policymaker’s risk attitude would affect the ranking of the programs. The fact that
the predictive distributions of the GAIN and AFDC options do not overlap suggests
that the difference is signiﬁcant, but the policies with individual assignment do
overlap with the policy of assigning all individuals to GAIN. The advantage of
working with the predictive distribution of the social welfare values is seen in Fig. 7,
which plots the CDFs of the predictive distributions for the ﬁrst four assignment
rules. We note that GAIN ﬁrst-order stochastically dominates AFDC, and in turn is

dominated by individual assignment policies. The ranking between the two
individual assignment policies is unclear, since they produce an almost identical
assignment.
The second social welfare function ranks the policy alternatives by postassignment probability of employment. GAIN (in keeping with its stated mandate)
does succeed in increasing the probability of employment relative to AFDC,
although the magnitude of the difference is not large (0.21, compared with 0.18). The
policy of individual assignment based on probability of employment, by deﬁnition,
maximizes the post-assignment probability of employment (0.22, compared with 0.20
for GAIN). Again, the outcome is very similar when individuals are assigned based
on expected post-evaluation earnings.
The third column reveals that the increased earnings realized by assigning all
individuals into GAIN do not offset the increased costs when compared with AFDC
(a net difference of $192 per person per quarter), nor are the costs of treatment
offset by increased earnings when individuals are assigned by a caseworker based on
the probability of employment or expected earnings. For assignment based on riskaverse (CRRA(3)) preferences, the program appears to break even. The ﬁnal row in
Table 8 highlights this point by considering assigning only those individuals to
treatment for whom the expected increase in earnings offsets the increased costs.
This maximizes the third social welfare criterion, which achieves a value of $46.
Fig. 8 illustrates that these policies, again, can be ranked by stochastic dominance.

Thus, combining the three columns of Table 8 suggests that policies which allow
individualized assignment dominate the policy in which all individuals are assigned
to GAIN: the former policies are cheaper and result in higher average earnings per
person. These policies also dominate AFDC in terms of average earnings. The only
policy that dominates AFDC in terms of increased earnings net-of-cost is explicitly
assigning to treatment only those individuals for whom increased earnings exceed
training costs. We conclude that allowing a caseworker to assign individuals into
GAIN and AFDC makes both individuals and the social planner better off; thus, we
reach a positive assessment of the treatment. In contrast, ignoring the possibility of
individual assignment, one would conclude that GAIN has a mixed and limited
impact on individual earnings, with its beneﬁts more than offset by the increased
costs of the program.
Another set of concerns for the policymaker is the distribution of the beneﬁts
from GAIN. Presumably not all forms of inequality are of concern to the
policymaker. Indeed, an increase in the upper percentiles of the earnings
distribution of GAIN relative to AFDC would be one of the aims of training.
However, if GAIN were to reduce earnings in the lower percentiles, then this
might be a source of concern. Table 9 presents percentiles of the predictive
distributions of earnings in each program (averaged over the 13 quarters and 1360
individuals). The 5th percentile for each of the policies is zero. From the 25th to
the 50th percentiles AFDC overtakes GAIN, and from the 50th to the 90th
percentiles GAIN overtakes AFDC. This is depicted in Fig. 9, which shows the
differences in the percentiles of earnings between GAIN and AFDC. The ﬁgure
reveals that AFDC once again overtakes GAIN for very high percentiles of earnings.
(This ﬁts into the pattern of Ms. Eight Twenty-Two in Table 5b, who had very high
pre-assignment earnings, but fared poorly in the treatment.) For individual
assignment to treatment, each of the percentiles exceeds the corresponding percentile
for GAIN or AFDC. The ﬁnal column in Table 9 presents a more synoptic view of
inequality by examining the 90-10 difference for each program. The 90-10 spread
increases from $361 for ADFC, to $453 for GAIN, to $494 for the individual
assignment policies.21
In Table 10, we explicitly examine the role of the policymaker’s attitude toward ex
ante inequality by applying a range of SWFs to the predictive distribution of postassignment earnings. The table reveals that for a sufﬁcient degree of inequality
aversion (either exponential or Rawlsian) the ranking between GAIN and AFDC is
reversed, with AFDC preferred. However, even for extreme inequality-aversion, the
policy of individual assignment is preferred to either GAIN or AFDC. The lower
two panels of the table demonstrate that this conclusion does not depend on the
individual preferences used to compute the certainty equivalents. As noted in Section
5, the social welfare rankings do not require standard errors or conﬁdence intervals;

21
Because the joint distribution of earnings is not identiﬁed, we cannot make claims about how
particular individuals fare relative to the distribution in each program. See Heckman and Smith (1998) and
Heckman et al. (1997) for an approach to doing this.

uncertainty is already accounted for, since the table is based on certainty equivalents
of the earnings distribution.
The overall picture that emerges from Tables 8–10 is that GAIN is strongly
preferred to AFDC in terms of earnings and the probability of employment, but not
in terms of earnings net-of-costs or in the presence of a sufﬁcient degree of inequality
aversion. The policy of individualized assignment emerges as superior to both GAIN
and AFDC in terms of all the criteria considered. Depending on the assignment rule,
this policy can also lead to a net gain in terms of increased earnings net-of-increasedcosts.

7. Conclusion
This paper examines the implications of shifting the emphasis in program
evaluation from examining average treatment effects and their statistical signiﬁcance
to looking at the underlying decision problem. There are several important
differences that emerge.
First, by considering the decision problem at the individual level (solved by the
caseworker), we can expose the heterogeneity in the treatment impact, and produce a
proﬁle of the winners and losers from GAIN. Second, by embedding individual
assignment within the policymaker’s decision problem, we allow the policymaker to

ARTICLE IN PRESS
R.H. Dehejia / Journal of Econometrics 125 (2005) 141–173

167

consider not only the usual policies of assigning all individuals to GAIN or AFDC,
but also policies that assign individuals based on a range of criteria such as
maximizing earnings or the probability of employment. Third, by considering the full
predictive distribution of the evaluation criteria (such as average earnings or
increased earnings net-of-costs), we are able to account systematically for
uncertainty in the policymaker’s decision. The question of whether the difference
between two programs is signiﬁcant now reduces to asking what decision a
policymaker would take. When the decision is invariant to the policymaker’s
preferences (as was the case in the GAIN example), an economically ‘‘signiﬁcant’’
ranking emerges. Finally, by converting uncertainty regarding individual earnings
into certainty equivalents, we are able to examine the importance of inequality
aversion in ranking programs.
These results are certainly important for an analysis of the GAIN data, but
they are also relevant to other exercises in program evaluation. For any program
in which there is heterogeneity in the treatment impact, there is potentially a
role for individualized assignment into treatment. This is especially true
for programs in which the gains from the treatment do not exceed the costs
for some individuals. Also, the importance of comparing outcomes under
different programs using their predictive distributions rather than simply the
ﬁrst moments of their empirical distributions applies quite broadly to
other evaluations. The relevance of this framework extends beyond the case of
randomized experiments considered here. In non-experimental settings, a similar
methodology could be adopted, if an appropriate selection correction mechanism
were adopted.
The model can be extended in a number of directions. First, in some
policy contexts, there may exist substantial prior information regarding the
control program. Such information could readily be incorporated into the
priors of the model. Second, there is scope to add greater heterogeneity,
perhaps by using a hierarchical model to incorporate many more interactions.
Third, the model could be modiﬁed to forecast beyond the 13 quarters included
in the dataset to extend the evaluation to longer horizons. Fourth, the framework
of individual assignment by a caseworker could be extended to allow individuals
to incorporate private information into their decisions; the policymaker then
would not simply offer individuals a choice but would design incentivecompatible assignment mechanisms (see Dehejia, 1999a). These are subjects of
ongoing research.

c.d.f., and y1 denotes the vector of non-zero observations and X1 the corresponding
covariates. See Chib (1992) for further details.
A.2. The estimation procedure
The posterior distribution of the parameters of the Tobit model is obtained
through a Gibbs sampling procedure. The Gibbs sampler is a Markov chain
Monte Carlo simulation technique that simulates the joint posterior of the
parameters of the model. Instead of drawing directly from the joint posterior
(often intractable), it draws successively from the posterior of each parameter (or
block of parameters) conditional on all of the other parameters. For any set of
starting values (given certain conditions), these draws will eventually converge to
draws from the true posterior (see Chib and Greenberg, 1996; Gelman et al., 1996;
Geman and Geman, 1984; Gelﬂand and Smith, 1990; Geweke, 1997; Tanner and
Wong, 1987).
In many cases, such as the Tobit, the task of drawing from the joint
posterior is simpliﬁed by augmenting the parameter space of the model. For the
Tobit model, the parameter space is expanded to include the latent variables y
it ;
conditional on this variable, the Tobit model reduces to a standard regression model,
and, conditional on all other parameters, it is easy to draw from the posterior
distribution of y
it .

The Gibbs sampling algorithm for the Tobit model has been worked out by Chib
(1992) (see also Albert and Chib, 1993). The Gibbs sampling scheme is:
(1) Let yzit equal yit for the uncensored observations, i.e., {i,t|yit>0}, and for the
censored observations, i.e., {i,t|yit=0}, draw for yzit from the negative portion of
a truncated normal distribution with mean xit b and variance s2.
(2) Draw for b from N b;
# s2 ðx0 xÞ1 ; where b# ¼ ðx0 xÞ1 x0 yz and yz ¼
ðyz1;1 ; yz1;2 ; y; yz1;13 ; y; yz1360;1 ; yz1360;2 ; y; yz1360;13 Þ0 : and x ¼ ðx1;1 ; y; x1360;13 Þ0 :


(3) Draw for s2 from Gamma 8840; jjyz  xbjj2 =2 :
From an arbitrary starting value, this is iterated 5,000 times. The ﬁrst 4000
iterations are discarded, leaving 1,000 draws from the posterior distribution of the
parameters.22
A.3. Simulating the predictive distribution
For each individual i in the group of interest, we consider xit;1 and xit;0 : The
speciﬁcation of xit;1 (xit;0 ) is identical to xit above, except that we impose Ti=1 (0).
We use our stored draws from the posterior distribution of the parameters,

In Sections 4.3 and 5, we produce predictive draws of earnings under treatment
and control for the 1360 individuals in the sample. For each individual, we
compute a range of assignment rules over the predictive treatment and control
distributions. For example, in Table 8 (row 3), for each individual, we compute the
probability of employment

Several diagnostics suggest that throwing out the ﬁrst 4000 runs is sufﬁcient to converge to draws
from the posterior. These include considering a wide variety of starting points, running the sampler for
more iterations, and comparing the mean of the posterior of the parameters with maximum likelihood
estimates of the same parameters.
