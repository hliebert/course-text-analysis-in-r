Reconciling Seemingly Contradictory Results from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment

ABSTRACT
A headline result from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment is that emergency room (ER) utilization
increased. A seemingly contradictory result from the Massachusetts health reform is that ER utilization
decreased. I reconcile both results by identifying treatment effect heterogeneity within the Oregon
experiment and then extrapolating it to Massachusetts. I find that even though Oregon compliers increased
their ER utilization, they were sicker than Oregon never takers, who would have decreased their ER
utilization. Massachusetts expanded coverage from a higher level to healthier individuals. Therefore,
Massachusetts compliers are comparable to a subset of Oregon never takers, which can reconcile the
results.

Introduction

Findings from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment are considered the “gold standard”
for evidence in health economics because they are based on a randomized lottery. The state
of Oregon conducted a lottery in 2008 as a fair way to expand eligibility for its Medicaid
health insurance program to a limited number of uninsured individuals. The lottery also
effectively created a randomized experiment that facilitated evaluation of the impact of
expanding health insurance coverage.
A headline finding from the Oregon experiment is that health insurance coverage increased emergency room (ER) utilization (Taubman et al., 2014). Legislation requires that
emergency rooms see all patients regardless of coverage, so the uninsured often access the
healthcare system through the ER. There was hope that coverage would decrease ER utilization, either because of substitution toward primary care or because of improved health.
However, it is plausible that coverage increased ER utilization because formerly uninsured
individuals could visit the ER at lower personal cost after gaining coverage. The sign and
magnitude of the treatment effect of insurance coverage on ER utilization are important for
policy evaluation because care provided in the ER is expensive, but the insured may value
additional ER care below its cost.
The finding that ER utilization increased in Oregon was particularly surprising because
previous evidence from an expansion of insurance coverage due to the Massachusetts health
reform of 2006 showed that ER utilization decreased or stayed the same (Chen et al., 2011;
Smulowitz et al., 2011; Kolstad and Kowalski, 2012; Miller, 2012). Unlike the Oregon policy,
the Massachusetts reform was a natural experiment that did not involve randomization.
Therefore, it is tempting to dismiss results based on the Massachusetts reform and to focus
on results from Oregon as the definitive answer for how insurance expansions affect ER
utilization. Discussion of the Oregon experiment and the Massachusetts reform in the New
York Times has done just that (Tavernise, 2014).
However, when results from two experiments give different answers, it need not be the
case that one experiment must be flawed. Instead, it could be the case that each experiment
yields a different local average treatment effect (LATE), in the terminology of Imbens and
Angrist (1994). If each LATE is derived from the same underlying marginal treatment
effect (MTE) function, as introduced by Björklund and Moffitt (1987) and further developed
by Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2001, 2005), Carneiro et al. (2011), Brinch et al. (2017),
and Cornelissen et al. (2018), among others, then it is possible to use the MTE function
to recover the two different LATEs, thereby reconciling the results. Although the MTE
literature generally focuses on a single context, I aim to use treatment effect heterogeneity
that I find within Oregon to reconcile results across the Oregon and Massachusetts contexts.
2

To do so, I begin with an MTE model shown by Vytlacil (2002) to assume no more than
the LATE assumptions of independence and monotonicity proposed by Imbens and Angrist
(1994). In my exposition of the model, I emphasize the link between the MTE and always
takers, compliers, and never takers, using the terminology of Angrist et al. (1996). In that
terminology, the LATE is the average treatment effect on “compliers” who gain coverage if
and only if they win the lottery. However, the MTE function also characterizes the treatment
effects on “always takers” who gain coverage regardless of the lottery outcome and “never
takers” who do not gain coverage regardless of the lottery outcome.
I use simple figures derived from the MTE model to make clear that the LATE assumptions imply an ordering from always takers to compliers to never takers, originally shown by
Imbens and Rubin (1997) and Vytlacil (2002). The intuition behind the ordering is simple.
Always takers are individuals that can take up coverage under the existing policy, compliers
are individuals that can take up coverage if and only if they win the lottery implemented
by the new policy, and never takers are remaining individuals that do not take up coverage
even if they win the lottery implemented by the new policy. Future policies that expand
coverage could enroll never takers, and future policies that contract coverage could disenroll
always takers. Therefore, even though the treatment effect on compliers is relevant for the
policy implemented by the experiment, treatment effects on always and never takers could
be relevant for other policies.
To reconcile the positive LATE from the Oregon experiment with the negative LATE
from the Massachusetts reform, I proceed in three steps. First, starting with the Oregon
experiment as the “gold standard,” I examine heterogeneity across always takers, compliers,
and never takers. I find adverse selection on ER utilization, previous ER utilization, and
self-reported health, indicating that health improves from always takers to compliers to
never takers. I also find that the treatment effect on ER utilization decreases from positive
to negative as health improves. Second, I find similar patterns in adverse selection and
treatment effect heterogeneity within Massachusetts. Third, I extrapolate adverse selection
and treatment effect heterogeneity from Oregon to Massachusetts. For extrapolation, I
compare Massachusetts compliers to a subset of Oregon never takers, since the Massachusetts
reform expanded coverage from a higher level than the Oregon experiment. Reassuringly,
extrapolation of adverse selection on self-reported health from Oregon to Massachusetts
yields an accurate prediction. I extrapolate treatment effect heterogeneity from Oregon
to Massachusetts by reweighting the Oregon MTE function to yield an average treatment
effect for Massachusetts compliers. I predict a decrease in ER utilization for Massachusetts
compliers of the same order of magnitude as the decrease found by Miller (2012), thereby
reconciling the positive LATE in Oregon with the negative LATE in Massachusetts.

Model

I begin with a model shown by Vytlacil (2002) to assume no more than the LATE assumptions. To ensure that I do not introduce additional assumptions, I follow the exposition from
Heckman and Vytlacil (2005) closely. However, I adapt the model to my empirical context,
and I build intuition using figures.
2.1

First Stage: Enrollment

Let the observed binary variable D represent enrollment in Medicaid, which is the “treatment” offered by the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment. Let VT represent potential utility
in the treated state (enrolled in Medicaid, D = 1), and let VU represent potential utility in
the untreated state (not enrolled in Medicaid, D = 0). The following definition relates
realized utility V to the potential utilities:
V = VU + (VT − VU )D.

(1)

I specify the net benefit of treatment in terms of the potential utilities as follows:
VT − VU = µD (Z, X) − νD ,

(2)

where µD (·) is an unspecified function, Z is an observed binary instrument, X is an optional
observed vector of covariates, and νD is an unobserved term with an unspecified distribution.
In the Oregon context, Z represents the outcome of the randomized lottery. Individuals with
Z = 0 are lottery losers. I refer to them as the “control group.” Individuals with Z = 1
are lottery winners. I refer to them as the “intervention group” because they receive the
intervention, an opportunity to be eligible for Medicaid. I need different terminology for the
intervention group (Z = 1) and the treated group (D = 1) because not all Oregon lottery
winners enroll in Medicaid. To derive an equation for treatment as a function of the lottery
outcome, I assume
A.1. (Continuity) The cumulative distribution function of νD conditional on X, which I
denote with F (· | X), is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure.
A.2. (Independence) The random vectors (νD ,γT ) and (νD ,γU ) are independent of Z conditional on X, where γT and γU are unobserved terms introduced in the second stage.
A.3. (Instrument Relevance) µD (Z, X) is a nondegenerate random variable conditional on
X.
Under A.1, the transformation of νD by the function F (· | X) is a normalization that yields
UD = F (νD | X), which is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, as I show for completeness
4

in Appendix A. Since νD enters negatively into the net benefit of treatment, I interpret
UD as the normalized “unobserved net cost of treatment.” The further imposition of A.2
implies the following treatment equation, which states that individuals are treated if their
unobserved net cost of treatment is weakly less than a threshold:
D = 1{UD ≤ P(D = 1 | Z = z, X)}.

(3)

I show the derivation in Appendix B for completeness. Under A.3, the threshold is different
for lottery winners and losers with the same vector of covariates X, which yields the following
two special cases:
D = 1{UD ≤ pCX }

where pCX = P D = 1 | Z = 0, X),

(4)

D = 1{UD ≤ pIX }

where pIX = P D = 1 | Z = 1, X),

(5)

where pCX is the probability of treatment in the control group conditional on X, and pIX is
the probability of treatment in the intervention group conditional on X.
As I show in Figure 1, these two special cases of the treatment equation allow me to
identify three distinct ranges of the unobserved net cost of treatment, UD . As originally
shown by Imbens and Rubin (1997) and Vytlacil (2002), the three ranges of UD correspond
to ranges for always takers, compliers, and never takers. Within my analysis sample from
the Oregon experiment, 15% of lottery losers enroll and 41% of lottery winners enroll. Accordingly, in Figure 1, I depict pC = 0.15 and pI = 0.41, omitting the X subscript. In the
top line of Figure 1, I depict the lottery losers. By (4), treated enrolled lottery losers have
0 ≤ UD ≤ 0.15. Treated lottery losers are always takers. In the middle line of Figure 1,
I depict the lottery winners. By (5), the untreated lottery winners have 0.41 < UD ≤ 1.
Untreated lottery winners are never takers. In the bottom line of Figure 1, I depict UD for
lottery losers and winners on the same axis, and I label the implied ranges of UD for always
and never takers. Individuals with values of UD in the middle range, 0.15 < UD ≤ 0.41,
enroll in Medicaid if they win the lottery, but they do not enroll if they lose the lottery.
These individuals are compliers.
The ordering from always takers to compliers to never takers along UD is an ordering
across an important margin: the margin of enrollment in Medicaid. As Medicaid enrollment
expands, always takers enroll first, followed by compliers, followed by never takers. There
could be several mechanisms for this ordering, all of which are captured by the unobserved
term UD . In the Oregon experiment, individuals entered the experiment by joining a waitlist
for Medicaid, but they were only required to provide eligibility documentation if they won.
Therefore, some individuals who were already eligible for Medicaid signed up for the lottery,

perhaps because they were not aware of their eligibility, and these individuals could become
always takers. On the other side of the spectrum, some individuals did not enroll in Medicaid
even if they won, either because they were ineligible or because they did not submit eligibility
information in the required timeframe. Therefore, UD could reflect eligibility, the submission
of eligibility information, or other factors. However, the model does not require me to specify
what is included in UD . Instead, it gives me a framework to think about and examine
empirically what factors separate always takers from compliers and never takers. As part of
that framework, I consider their ER utilization in the second stage.
2.2

Second Stage: ER Utilization

I relate Medicaid enrollment D to realized ER utilization Y as follows:
Y = YU + (YT − YU )D,

(6)

where I specify potential ER utilization with Medicaid YT and without Medicaid YU as
follows:
YT = gT (X, UD , γT )

(7)

YU = gU (X, UD , γU ),

(8)

where gU (·) and gT (·) are unspecified functions, X is the same optional vector of observed
covariates from the first stage, UD is the normalized unobserved net cost of treatment from
the first stage, and γT and γU represent additional unobserved terms with unspecified distributions in the second stage. To make sure that average treated and untreated potential
outcomes are defined for each X, I assume:
A.4. (Treated and Untreated) 0 < P(D = 1 | X) < 1.
A.5. (Second Stage Technical Assumption) The values of E[YT ] and E[YU ] are finite.
6

As a whole, because I have only made stylistic changes to the model presented by Heckman
and Vytlacil (2005), by the proof of Vytlacil (2002), the model, given by the utility equations
(1) and (2), the treatment equations (3)–(5), the potential outcome equations (6)–(8), and
assumptions A.2–A.5, assumes no more than the LATE assumptions.
Under the model and the equivalent LATE assumptions, it is not possible to identify
any individual as a complier, but it is possible to derive the average treated and untreated
outcomes of compliers. It is also possible to derive the average treated outcome for always
takers and the average untreated outcome for never takers. However, it is not possible to
derive the average untreated outcome for always takers or the average treated outcome for
never takers without further assumptions because always takers are always treated and never
takers are never treated within the experiment. In Appendix C, I use the model to derive the
average treated outcomes for always takers and compliers, and average untreated outcomes
for compliers and never takers. My derivation is consistent with the derivations of Imbens
and Rubin (1997), Katz et al. (2001), Abadie (2002), and Abadie (2003), which rely on the
LATE assumptions.
I use the average treated and untreated outcomes that I derive from publicly available
data from the Oregon experiment to illustrate the implications of the model graphically in
Figure 2. Along the vertical axis, I depict average ER utilization after the lottery took
place from March 10, 2008 to September 30, 2009. I show that during that period, always
takers visited the ER 1.89 times, compliers visited 1.45 times if enrolled and 1.19 times
if not, and never takers visited 0.85 times. The difference in visits between treated and
untreated compliers is equal to the LATE, as shown by Imbens and Rubin (1997). I depict
the LATE with an arrow to indicate that it has magnitude and direction. The positive
LATE of 0.27 is consistent with the headline finding of Taubman et al. (2014), who show
that insurance increases ER utilization for compliers.1 Figure 2 provides more information
than the LATE alone. As originally shown by Angrist (1990) and Angrist and Krueger
(1992), the calculation of the LATE does not require the ability to calculate the average
1

The focus of my work is on reconciling a positive LATE in Oregon with a negative LATE in Massachusetts, not on evaluating the Oregon experiment or previous analysis of it, which has been discussed
in Baicker et al. (2013, 2014); Taubman et al. (2014), and Finkelstein et al. (2016). I am able to replicate
the LATE of 0.41 reported by Taubman et al. (2014), almost exactly, limited only by minor changes made
to the publicly available data to hinder identification of individuals with large and uncommon numbers of
ER visits. However, that LATE is obtained from a regression that includes controls for previous ER utilization as well as the number of lottery entrants from a household. It would not be valid to obtain a LATE
without any control for the number of lottery entrants because the probability of winning the lottery was
only random conditional on the number of entrants. Therefore, I control for the number of lottery entrants
nonparametrically by restricting my analysis sample to the 19,643 individuals that were the only members
of their household to enter the lottery from the full sample of 24,646 individuals with administrative data on
their visits to the ER. By doing so and excluding controls for previous ER utilization for simplicity, I obtain
a smaller, but still positive, LATE.

treated and untreated outcomes of compliers depicted in Figure 2. Figure 2 also includes
average outcomes for always and never takers, which are not required to calculate the LATE.
If these outcomes are different from the comparable outcomes for compliers, then there could
be reason to question whether the LATE applies to always and never takers. Such differences
could reflect selection or treatment effect heterogeneity.
2.3

Definitions of Selection and Treatment Effect Heterogeneity

I define selection and treatment effect heterogeneity on Y along UD using the following
functions:
Selection Heterogeneity:
Treatment Effect Heterogeneity:
Selection + Treatment Effect Heterogeneity:
8

MUO(x, p) = E [YU | X = x, UD = p]
MTE(x, p) = E [YT − YU | X = x, UD = p]
MTO(x, p) = E [YT | X = x, UD = p] ,

where x is a realization of the covariate vector X and p is a realization of the unobserved
net cost of treatment UD .
I refer to the first function as the “marginal untreated outcome (MUO)” function, and
I use it to define “selection heterogeneity,” a term that I use to capture positive and negative selection, also referred to as “adverse” and “advantageous” selection in the insurance
literature. The MTE literature uses the MUO function as an intermediate function in the
derivation of the second function, the “marginal treatment effect (MTE)” function of Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2001, 2005). However, the literature does not use the MUO function
to define selection heterogeneity (see Carneiro and Lee, 2009; Brinch et al., 2017). Instead,
the MTE literature and the LATE literature focus on the following definition of “selection
bias” (see Heckman et al., 1998; Angrist, 1998):
Selection Bias: E[YU | D = 1] − E[YU | D = 0].

(9)

By expressing (9) as the following weighted integral of the MUO function:
Z 1h

n
o

P(Z = 0) pC ω(p, 0, pc ) + P(Z = 1) pI ω(p, 0, pI )

P(Z = 0) (1 − pC ) ω(p, pc , 1) + P(Z = 1) (1 − pI ) ω(p, pI , 1) MUO(p) dp,
−
P(D = 0)

where the weights are ω(p, pL , pH ) = 1{pL ≤ p < pH }/(pH −pL ), I demonstrate that selection
heterogeneity generalizes selection bias. The weighted integral also shows that selection bias
is a function of the fraction of lottery winners, P(Z = 1), unlike selection heterogeneity.
To the extent that selection bias is intended to capture a real-world phenomenon, it is
undesirable for it to be an explicit function of the experimental design used to estimate
it. Furthermore, selection bias is not identified without ancillary assumptions because the
untreated outcome for always takers is not observed. However, I show that a different policyrelevant special case of selection heterogeneity is identified without ancillary assumptions.
Turning to the last function, which I refer to as the “marginal treated outcome (MTO)”
function, I emphasize that it defines the sum of selection heterogeneity plus treatment effect
heterogeneity. The literature considers the MTO and MUO functions as intermediate inputs
in the derivation of the MTE function, but it does not make a meaningful distinction between
them (see Brinch et al., 2017). It is tempting to assert that there should be no meaningful
distinction between the MTO and MUO functions because it should be possible to rename
the treated as the untreated and vice versa. However, the treatment effect is defined relative
to the untreated outcome, so changing the definition of the treatment would also change
the definition of the treatment effect, creating a different asymmetry between the MTO
9

and MUO. The treatment effect has magnitude and direction: it is equal to YT − YU , not
|YT − YU |, so the distinction between treated and untreated can be important.

3

Findings

I have three main findings. First, I find selection and treatment effect heterogeneity within
Oregon along the unobservable that separates always takers from compliers from never takers.
Selection heterogeneity is adverse in terms of ER utilization and in terms of observed measures of health. Treatment effect heterogeneity is such that even though compliers increase
their ER utilization upon gaining coverage, never takers would decrease their ER utilization
upon gaining coverage. Second, I find a similar pattern in selection and treatment effect
heterogeneity within Massachusetts. Third, I find that treatment effect heterogeneity within
Oregon can reconcile the positive LATE in Oregon with the negative LATE in Massachusetts
because Massachusetts compliers are comparable to a subset of Oregon never takers.
3.1
3.1.1

Heterogeneity Within Oregon
Adverse Selection on ER Utilization

I identify a special case of selection heterogeneity using a test that I refer to as the “untreated outcome test.” The test statistic for this test is equal to the average untreated
outcome of compliers minus the average untreated outcome of never takers. I derive both of
these quantities in Appendix C. The untreated outcome test is similar or equivalent to tests
proposed by Bertanha and Imbens (2014), Guo et al. (2014), and Black et al. (2017), which
are generalized by Mogstad et al. (2018).2 Relative to the literature, my innovation with
respect to the untreated outcome test is that I show that it identifies selection heterogeneity
without any assumptions beyond the LATE assumptions. This follows because having defined selection heterogeneity via the MUO function in an MTE model that assumes no more
than the LATE assumptions, I express the untreated outcome test statistic as the following
weighted integral of the MUO function:
E[YU | pC < UD ≤ pI ] − E[YU | pI < UD ≤ 1] =
2

Z
0

1

(ω(p, pC , pI ) − ω(p, pI , 1)) MUO(p) dp,

I refer to the Bertanha and Imbens (2014) test as “similar” to the untreated outcome test because the
authors develop it for a regression discontinuity context, but it is effectively equivalent. However, the authors
do not interpret it as a test of selection heterogeneity; instead, they interpret it as one component of a test
for external validity. Guo et al. (2014) propose a test that is equivalent to the untreated outcome test as
one component of a test for unmeasured confounding, but they also do not discuss it as a test for selection
heterogeneity. Black et al. (2017) propose a test that is equivalent to the untreated outcome test as a test
for selection bias on the untreated outcome, which they define with the outcome test statistic. They do not
discuss how their definition of selection bias relates to the MUO function or to the definition of selection
bias from the literature.

The number of ER visits represents the total number of visits to the emergency department during the study

differences between statistics might not appear internally consistent because of rounding.

with weights ω(p, pL , pH ) = 1{pL ≤ p < pH }/(pH − pL ), where the first term represents the
average untreated outcome of compliers (pC < UD ≤ pI ) and the second term represents the
average untreated outcome of never takers (pI < UD ≤ 1).
Applying the untreated outcome test to my analysis sample from the Oregon experiment,
I reject the null hypothesis of selection homogeneity. As shown in Figure 2 and Table 1, when
they are not enrolled in Medicaid, compliers visit the ER an average of 1.19 times, while
never takers visit 0.85 times. The difference of 0.34 visits, reported as the untreated outcome
test statistic, is statistically different from zero, according to the bootstrapped standard error
computed as the standard deviation of the statistic over 200 replications. Under the model,
compliers enroll in Medicaid before never takers, so the selection heterogeneity that I find
indicates adverse selection along the unobservable that separates compliers to never takers.
3.1.2

Adverse Selection on Self-Reported Health and Previous ER
Utilization

Next, I characterize adverse selection in terms of observables. To do so, I define selection
heterogeneity on X along UD :
Selection Heterogeneity on X: E [X | UD = p] ,

11

which captures how the covariate vector X changes with the unobserved net cost of treatment
UD . I identify selection heterogeneity on X by comparing the average covariate vector of
always takers, compliers, and never takers. Just like selection heterogeneity on Y , selection
heterogeneity on a single covariate can be either positive or negative between compliers and
never takers. It can also be either positive or negative between always takers and compliers.
I begin by examining self-reported health. I only observe self-reported health for a subset
of the individuals in the Oregon administrative data who were surveyed. Self-reported health
was elicited after randomization, and Finkelstein et al. (2012) shows that Medicaid improved
self-reported health. That is, there is a treatment effect on self-reported health. To ensure
that my examination of selection heterogeneity is not contaminated by treatment effect
heterogeneity, I only compare the self-reported health of untreated individuals: compliers
who lost the lottery and never takers. I obtain the average probability that individuals in
these groups reported fair or poor health using the method I describe in Appendix C.
As shown in Table 2, within Oregon, I find that never takers are less likely to be in
fair or poor health than untreated compliers, and the difference is statistically significant.
Therefore, I find adverse selection on self-reported health that is consistent with the adverse
selection on ER utilization that I find using the untreated outcome test. This adverse
selection indicates that never takers are healthier than compliers, which may be one reason
they visit the ER less frequently. It would also be interesting to examine whether there is
adverse selection from always takers to compliers, such that compliers are healthier than
always takers. However, I do not observe untreated self-reported health for always takers.
To that end, I turn to previous ER utilization as an alternative proxy for health because I
observe it for all individuals, including always takers. Specifically, for each individual in the
Oregon administrative data, I observe the total number of pre-period ER visits from January
1, 2007, to March 9, 2008. I report the average pre-period ER utilization for always takers,
compliers, and never takers by cumulative visits in Table 2. As reported, 45% of always
takers, 35% of compliers, and 31% of never takers had at least one previous ER visit, and
the differences across groups are statistically significant. Therefore, I find adverse selection
on previous ER utilization, not just from compliers to never takers, but also from always
takers to compliers.
To further illustrate how previous ER utilization varies from always takers to compliers
to never takers, Figure 3 plots statistics on previous ER utilization from Table 2. Always
takers are more likely to have at least one, at least two, at least three, and at least four
previous ER visits than compliers. Similar relationships hold between compliers and never
takers. Furthermore, the relationships are approximately linear in the unobserved net cost
of treatment UD .

Note. Bootstrapped standard errors are in parentheses. Data for the Massachusetts health reform are taken
from pooled annual samples of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from years 2004–
2009 and restricted to ages 21–64 (the age range of the Oregon sample). For the Massachusetts health
reform, treatment is an indicator that equals one for individuals with any form of health insurance (“Do
you have any kind of health care coverage, including health insurance, prepaid plans such as HMOs, or
government plans such as Medicare?”). The instrument is an indicator that equals one in the post-period
of the expansion on and after July 2007. “Age” is measured in year 2008 for the Oregon Health Insurance
Experiment and in year 2006 for the Massachusetts health reform. “Female” is a binary indicator for the
sex of the respondent. “English” is a binary indicator that equals one for individuals in the Oregon Health
Insurance Experiment who requested materials in English and that equals one for individuals in the BRFSS
who completed the interview in English. The number of pre-period visits is measured before the study period
from January 1, 2007 to March 9, 2008. “Fair or Poor Health” equals one when individuals self-report having
fair or poor health on a 5-point scale. a Number of observations in the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment

UD : unobserved net cost of treatment

Note. The number of pre-period ER visits represents the number of ER visits before the experiment took
place from January 1, 2007 to March 9, 2008. Treatment represents enrollment in Medicaid. pC is the
probability of treatment in the control group, and pI is the probability of treatment in the intervention
group.

Not all observables exhibit such a clear selection pattern. As shown in Table 2, age,
sex, and English-speaking status, exhibit patterns that are not even necessarily monotonic
from always takers to compliers to never takers. Therefore, these observables cannot explain adverse selection on ER utilization. In contrast, self-reported health and previous ER
utilization, which are both proxies for health, can explain adverse selection on ER utilization, implying that individuals with higher unobserved net cost of treatment UD tend to be
healthier.
3.1.3

Treatment Effect Heterogeneity on ER Utilization

To identify treatment effect heterogeneity on ER utilization along UD , I make a transparent
ancillary assumption beyond the model:
AA.1. (Linear Selection Heterogeneity and Linear Treatment Effect Heterogeneity) In (7)
and (8), for k ∈ {T, U }, specify gk (X, UD , γk ) = αk +βk UD +γk , where E [γk | UD = p] =
14

0. Therefore,
MUO(p) = E [YU | UD = p] = αU + βU p
MTE(p) = E [YT − YU | UD = p] = (αT − αU ) + (βT − βU ) p
MTO(p) = E [YT | UD = p] = αT + βT p.
Brinch et al. (2017) impose the same assumption to examine the impact of family size on
child outcomes; Olsen (1980) imposes linearity of the MTO function to examine the impact
of family size on maternal outcomes; and several other papers impose linearity of the MTE
function in other applications (see Moffitt, 2008; French and Song, 2014). Applied work that
extrapolates to other policies using the LATE also makes a stronger, implicit assumption
that there is no treatment effect heterogeneity, which implies that the MTE function is linear
and has zero slope.
In the Oregon context, the empirical findings of adverse selection on ER utilization,
self-reported health, and previous ER utilization provide motivation for AA.1. The adverse
selection findings imply that healthier individuals have higher unobserved net cost of treatment UD . Furthermore, selection heterogeneity on previous ER utilization is approximately
linear in UD . Therefore, the assumption that treatment effect heterogeneity is linear in
UD allows the treatment effect to vary with health as selection varies with health. I note,
however, that AA.1 allows for selection and treatment effect heterogeneity to have slopes of
different signs and magnitudes. I also note that AA.1 allows for the possibility that there is
no selection or treatment effect heterogeneity, which occurs when the MUO and MTE slope
coefficients are both be equal to zero.
Figure 4 depicts the MTO, MUO, and MTE functions within the Oregon experiment
under AA.1. On the vertical axis, the two points labeled with filled circular markers indicate
the average outcomes of always takers and treated compliers, which fall at the median of
the support for each group on the horizontal axis. These two points identify the intercept
and slope of the MTO function, depicted with a dotted line. The two points labeled with
filled square markers identify the intercept and slope of the MUO function, depicted with
a dashed line. I depict the MTE function, the vertical difference between the MTO and
MUO functions, with a solid line. As shown, the MTE function is positive for low levels
of enrollment and negative for high levels of enrollment, even though the LATE is positive.
The downward slope of the MTE function indicates that the treatment effect of insurance
on ER utilization decreases as the unobserved net cost of treatment UD increases.

3.1.4

Previous ER Utilization Explains Treatment Effect Heterogeneity

Given the evidence that health improves as the unobserved net cost of treatment increases,
a natural question is whether differences in health explain treatment effect heterogeneity. To
answer this question, I quantify how much treatment effect heterogeneity I can explain with
observables, particularly those that proxy for health. To do so, I incorporate observables
into the MTE function using a shape restriction commonly used in the MTE literature (see
Cornelissen et al., 2018; Brinch et al., 2017; Carneiro and Lee, 2009; Carneiro et al., 2011;
Maestas et al., 2013). In my context, the shape restriction requires that included observables
X and the remaining unobserved net cost of treatment UD have additively-separable impacts
on ER utilization with and without Medicaid. I incorporate the shape restriction into AA.1
to obtain the following alternative ancillary assumption:
AA.2. (Linear Selection Heterogeneity and Linear Treatment Effect Heterogeneity with
16

Covariate Shape Restriction) In (7) and (8), for k ∈ {T, U }, specify gk (X, UD , γk ) =
δk0 X + λk UD + γk , where E [γk | X = x, UD = p] = 0. Therefore,
MUO(x, p) = E [YU | X = x, UD = p] = δU0 x + λU p

MTE(x, p) = E [YT − YU | X = x, UD = p] = (δT − δU )0 x + (λT − λU ) p

MTO(x, p) = E [YT | X = x, UD = p] = δT0 x + λT p.

I present an algorithm for estimation of these functions that simplifies the Heckman et al.
(2006) algorithm in Appendix D.

Note. The number of ER visits represents the total number of visits to the emergency department during
the study period from March 10, 2008 to September 30, 2009. Pre-period ER visits refers to a group of
indicators for visiting the ER 0 times, 1 time, 2–3 times, and 4 or more times during the pre-period from
January 1, 2007 to March 9, 2008. Treatment represents enrollment in Medicaid. pC is the probability of
treatment in the control group, and pI is the probability of treatment in the intervention group. In this
figure, the function for 1 pre-period ER visits has been shifted downward slightly to make it easier to discern
from the function for 2–3 pre-period ER visits.

To evaluate whether health explains treatment effect heterogeneity, I incorporate proxies
for health into the MTE function. Because self-reported health represents an outcome as
opposed to an observable for treated individuals, I do not incorporate it into the MTE
function as an observable. However, I do incorporate previous ER utilization into the MTE
17

function because it represents an observable for all individuals.
Incorporating previous ER utilization into the MTE via AA.2, I find that previous ER
utilization can explain the entire decrease in treatment effect from always takers to compliers
to never takers. Incorporating indicators for each of four visit ranges (zero pre-period visits,
one pre-period visit, 2 to 3 pre-period visits, and 4 or more pre-period visits) into the
MTE, I obtain a separate MTE(x, p) for each visit range. As depicted in Figure 5, the
MTE(p) function, which does not incorporate observables, has a pronounced downward
slope, indicating substantial unexplained heterogeneity in treatment effect. However, when
I incorporate controls for previous ER utilization into the MTE(x, p) function, the negative
slope disappears, and the slope becomes slightly positive. The remaining slope in the MTE
with observables is not of a meaningful magnitude. Therefore, previous ER utilization can
explain all of the treatment effect heterogeneity in MTE(p).

Note. The number of ER visits represents the total number of visits to the emergency department during

indicators for visiting the ER 0 times, 1 time, 2–3 times, and 4 or more times during the pre-period from
January 1, 2007 to March 9, 2008. Treatment represents enrollment in Medicaid. “Age” is measured in year
2008. “Female” is a binary indicator for the sex of the respondent. “English” is a binary indicator that
equals one for individuals who requested materials in English. The specification with other covariates (age,
female, English) includes all two-way interactions. pC is the probability of treatment in the control group,
and pI is the probability of treatment in the intervention group.

18

Looking beyond the slope of the MTE function to its level reveals a clear monotonic
relationship between pre-period ER visits and the treatment effect of Medicaid enrollment
on subsequent ER visits. As depicted in Figure 5, the MTE(x, p) for individuals with 4 or
more pre-period visits is always positive, and the MTE(x, p) for individuals with zero preperiod visits is always negative. This figure demonstrates that individuals with high numbers
of ER visits in the pre-period increase their ER utilization upon gaining coverage, while
individuals with zero ER visits in the pre-period decrease their ER utilization upon gaining
coverage. This finding suggests that observable variation in health can explain treatment
effect heterogeneity. In particular, these results suggest that health improves from always
takers to compliers to never takers, and treatment effects decrease from positive to negative
as health improves.
Not all observables can explain treatment effect heterogeneity. When I include age, sex,
and English-speaking status as well as their two-way interactions in the MTE, substantial
heterogeneity remains unexplained. I compare unexplained heterogeneity across various
MTE functions in Figure 6. To do so, I present E[MTE(x, p)] functions, which average
included observed heterogeneity across all individuals. Consistent with the depiction in
Figure 5, the inclusion of pre-period ER visits in MTE(x, p) results in a function that is
flatter than MTE(p). Therefore, the inclusion of pre-period ER visits decreases unexplained
heterogeneity in the treatment effect. In contrast, the inclusion of the other observables
in MTE(x, p) results in a function that is steeper than MTE(p). Therefore, the inclusion
of these other observables increases unexplained heterogeneity in the treatment effect. My
analysis demonstrates that the choice of which observables to include in the MTE function
matters.
3.2

Comparable Heterogeneity within Massachusetts

My goal is to reconcile the Oregon and Massachusetts LATEs using the Oregon MTE function, since estimates from the Oregon experiment are considered the “gold standard.” Before
assuming that the Massachusetts MTE function is the same as the Oregon MTE function,
however, I assess whether such an assumption is plausible. Therefore, I examine evidence
from Massachusetts to determine if selection and treatment effect heterogeneity are similar
in both states.
3.2.1

Adverse Selection on Self-Reported Health

Just as I find adverse selection on self-reported health in Oregon, I also find adverse selection on self-reported health in Massachusetts. I do so using the Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System (BRFSS) data that I used to study the Massachusetts reform in Kolstad and Kowalski (2012). I define the treatment D as enrollment in any health insurance

19

in Massachusetts, and I define Z as after the reform. These definitions are in line with the
literature on the Massachusetts reform. Table 2 shows that 21% of untreated Massachusetts
compliers are in fair or poor health, whereas 18% of Massachusetts never takers are in fair
or poor health, consistent with adverse selection on self-reported health. As in Oregon, I do
not examine self-reported health of always takers because it is elicited after the reform. I do
not observe previous ER utilization as an alternative proxy for health.
Using the same BRFSS data, Table 2 also provides evidence of selection heterogeneity
on other observables in Massachusetts. In particular, always takers are more likely to be
female and speak English than compliers and never takers. These same selection patterns
do not appear as clearly in Oregon. However, my analysis of the Oregon data does not
provide reason to expect that selection on sex and English-speaking status translates into
differential treatment effects; there is more unexplained treatment effect heterogeneity in
Oregon when I include age, sex, and English-speaking status into the MTE function. In
Oregon, selection heterogeneity on these other observables is second order to selection on
health, which explains treatment effect heterogeneity.
3.2.2

Treatment Effect Heterogeneity On Total Health Care Utilization

I have shown that treatment effects on ER utilization decrease from always takers to compliers to never takers in Oregon. I do not observe ER utilization in the BRFSS data, so
I cannot examine treatment effect heterogeneity on ER utilization using those data. Furthermore, none of the studies that examine the impact of the Massachusetts reform on ER
utilization use individual-level data,3 and I cannot identify average outcomes of always takers, compliers, and never takers with the available aggregate data.
However, I can examine total health care utilization as a proxy for ER utilization. Taubman et al. (2014) report evidence from the Oregon experiment that shows that ER spending and total health care spending are complements. If that is the case, then decreasing
treatment effect on total health care spending implies a decreasing treatment effect on ER
utilization along the unobserved net cost of treatment UD .
To examine treatment effect heterogeneity on total health care utilization, I recast results
from my previous work on the Massachusetts reform from Hackmann et al. (2015) in terms
3

Chen et al. (2011) use data on ER visits from the Massachusetts Division of Health Care Finance and
Policy aggregated to the quarter level, but they do not use data on insurance. Miller (2012) uses the same
data aggregated to the county-quarter level, matched to county-level data on insurance before the reform,
but the individual-level data on ER utilization and insurance coverage before and after the reform are not
available. In Kolstad and Kowalski (2012), I use data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS), which contains all the necessary elements except ER utilization. I also use the Healthcare Cost
and Utilization Project (HCUP) National Inpatient Sample (NIS), which contains the necessary elements
on the individual level, but it is restricted to individuals who were admitted to the hospital. The data from
Smulowitz et al. (2011) are even more restricted because they only include individuals who visited the ER
at a convenience sample of 11 Massachusetts hospitals.

of the MTE model with ancillary assumption AA.1. To do so, I reproduce Figure 8 from
Hackmann et al. (2015) using notation consistent with the MTE model while preserving
notation from the original figure in lighter typeface in Figure 7. I recast the marginal
cost function estimated in Hackmann et al. (2015) as a marginal treatment effect function
because it represents the difference between marginal costs to insurers on behalf of insured
individuals and uninsured individuals. This Massachusetts MTE function, like the Oregon
MTE function, is downward sloping, indicating that in both contexts, the treatment effect
of insurance on utilization decreases as the unobserved net cost of treatment UD increases.
Therefore, extrapolation from Oregon to Massachusetts has potential to be a meaningful
exercise.
3.3
3.3.1

MTE-Reweighting Can Reconcile Oregon and Massachusetts LATEs
MTE-Reweighting Can Reconcile LATEs

Before I can extrapolate using the Oregon MTE function to estimate a LATE in Massachusetts, I must assess where the Massachusetts compliers should lie along the support of
the Oregon unobserved net cost of treatment UD . Recall that in Oregon, the fraction treated
21

among the control group is pC = 0.15, and the fraction treated among the intervention group
is pI = 0.41. These values partition the support of the unobserved net cost of treatment
UD . Therefore, an alternative interpretation of UD is that it represents the fraction treated
among the intervention or control groups. As UD increases from 0 to 1, the fraction treated
increases from 0% to 100%.
In the Massachusetts BRFSS data, the fraction of the state population with health insurance coverage increased from 89% before the reform to 94% after the reform. Unlike the
Hackmann et al. (2015) data, which only capture enrollment in the individual health insurance market, the BRFSS data capture enrollment in the entire state. Because estimates
from the literature on the impact of the Massachusetts reform on ER utilization (Chen et al.,
2011; Kolstad and Kowalski, 2012; Miller, 2012; Smulowitz et al., 2011) reflect enrollment in
the entire state, it is important that my reconciliation exercise employs data that does not
restrict the sample to a segment of the market.
As a starting point for comparison, I interpret UD as the fraction treated among the
entire state population before and after the reform in Massachusetts, just as I can interpret
it as the fraction treated among the intervention and control groups in Oregon. I label the
probability of health insurance coverage before and after the reform in Massachusetts as
A
A
pM
= 0.89 and pM
= 0.94 along the top axis of Figure 8. For comparison, I re-label the
C
I
OR
= 0.41 along the bottom axis. The comparison
Oregon probabilities as pOR
C = 0.15 and pI
implies that Massachusetts compliers are comparable to the subset of Oregon never takers
with an unobserved net cost of treatment between 0.89 and 0.94. I provide two rationales
that support this comparison.
First, the Massachusetts reform included a mandate that required individuals to pay a
penalty if they did not have health insurance. In contrast, the Oregon reform did not include
a penalty. The Massachusetts penalty may have induced individuals who would have been
never takers in the Oregon context to take up coverage and thus become compliers in the
Massachusetts context.
Second, statistics on self-reported health provide quantitative evidence that Massachusetts
compliers are comparable to Oregon never takers. Recall from Table 2 that untreated compliers report worse health than never takers within Oregon and Massachusetts. To compare
these statistics across Oregon and Massachusetts, Figure 8 plots the fraction of untreated
compliers and never takers who report fair or poor health in each state at the midpoint of the
relevant range of unobserved net cost of treatment UD . It also plots lines of best fit within
Massachusetts and Oregon. These lines use the observed points within each state to predict
self-reported health at other values of UD . The Oregon prediction is quantitatively close to
the observed Massachusetts points, demonstrating that the health of Massachusetts compli-

ers is like that of Oregon never takers with UD between 0.89 and 0.94. These predictions
also demonstrate that there is merit in linear extrapolation of Oregon heterogeneity.
Formally, I extrapolate Oregon selection and treatment effect heterogeneity by reweighting the Oregon MTE function and its component MTO and MUO functions over a general
range pL < UD ≤ pH as follows:
E [YT | pL < UD ≤ pH ] =
E [YU | pL < UD ≤ pH ] =

using weights ω(p, pL , pH ) = 1{pL < p ≤ pH }/(pH − pL ). These weights are special cases
of general weights for MTE-reweighting given by Heckman and Vytlacil (2007). Unlike the
weights used by Brinch et al. (2017), these weights allow me to recover the exact values of
the LATE and the average outcomes for Oregon always takers (0 ≤ UD ≤ pC ), compliers
(pC < UD ≤ pI ), and never takers (pI < UD ≤ 1) reported in Table 1. These weights
also allow me to predict an untreated average outcome for Oregon always takers, a treated
average outcome for Oregon never takers, and separate average treatment effects for Oregon
always and never takers, as reported in the shaded cells of Table 1 and the unfilled points
of Figure 4. These predictions indicate that if always takers were not enrolled in Medicaid,
then they would visit the ER 1.35 times, implying a positive always taker average treatment
effect of 0.54 visits. In contrast, if never takers were enrolled in Medicaid, then they would
visit the ER 0.55 times, implying a negative never taker average treatment effect of 0.29
visits.
To extrapolate treatment effect heterogeneity from Oregon to Massachusetts, I begin
by reweighting the Oregon MTE(p) over the implied range of the unobserved net cost of

the approach graphically in Figure 9 by reproducing MTE(p) from Oregon and labeling the
support for Massachusetts compliers. As depicted, the extrapolated Massachusetts LATE
predicts that the Massachusetts reform decreased ER utilization by an average of 0.57 ER
visits among Massachusetts compliers. To put the magnitude of this result in context, Miller
(2012) finds that Massachusetts compliers decreased their ER utilization by 0.67 to 1.28 visits
per person per year, depending on the empirical strategy.4 The decrease that I find over the
19 months from March 10, 2008 to September 30, 2009 translates into a decrease of 0.36
visits per person per year (=(0.57/19)*12), which is smaller but still negative. Therefore,
reweighting of the Oregon MTE(p) function can reconcile the increase in ER utilization in
Oregon with the decrease in ER utilization in Massachusetts using only variation in the
unobserved net cost of treatment UD .
Next, I refine the extrapolation to account for differences in observables between Oregon
and Massachusetts. The only observables that are available for all individuals in the Oregon

Other estimates from the literature are not directly comparable. Chen et al. (2011) does not provide
an estimate but reports no change in ER utilization based on figures that compare ER utilization in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont over time. The Kolstad and Kowalski (2012) estimate shows that
hospital admissions from the ER decreased by 2.02 percentage points after the reform relative to before the
reform in Massachusetts relative to other states. The Smulowitz et al. (2011) estimate shows that low-severity
visits to the ER decreased by 1.8% after the reform relative to before the reform for publicly-subsidized and
uninsured patients relative to insured and Medicare patients.

and Massachusetts data are age, sex, and English-speaking status, reported in Table 2.
To account for these observables in the extrapolation, I evaluate the Oregon MTE(x, p)
at the Massachusetts covariate vector XMA , and I reweight the resulting function over the
support for Massachusetts compliers. In depict the extrapolation in Figure 9. The resulting
LATE that accounts for Massachusetts observables implies an average decrease of 0.79 visits
over an approximately 19-month period, which implies an annual decrease of 0.50 visits
(=(0.79/19)*12). This prediction is even closer to the Miller (2012) estimates.
3.3.2

LATE-Reweighting Cannot Reconcile LATEs

Finally, I consider whether I could have reconciled the positive LATE in Oregon with the
negative LATE in Massachusetts using only the common observables available for all individuals in both contexts. I reweight the Oregon LATE in the tradition of Angrist and
Fernandez-Val (2013) and Hotz et al. (2005). To examine variation in the observables available for LATE-reweighting, I use each observable to divide the sample into two subgroups,
and I report LATEs within each subgroup in Table E1. The LATEs within all but one
subgroup are positive. Taubman et al. (2014) also report LATEs within a wide variety of
observable subgroups and find that almost all are positive. To reweight the Oregon LATE,
I calculate a LATE within each joint realization of age (an indicator that age is at least the
Oregon median), sex, and English-speaking status in Oregon. I then take a weighted average
of these eight LATEs according to the joint frequency of the three variables among Massachusetts compliers. This LATE-reweighting protocol yields an increase of 0.23 visits among
Massachusetts compliers. Therefore, LATE-reweighting using only the available observables
cannot reconcile the positive treatment effect in Oregon with the negative treatment effect
in Massachusetts.
It is not surprising that LATE-reweighting with age, sex, and English-speaking status
cannot reconcile the results because these observables cannot explain treatment effect heterogeneity within Oregon. My analysis of the Oregon MTE shows that the meaningful treatment
effect heterogeneity is across the unobservable that separates always takers from compliers
from never takers, not across compliers with different values of the common observables.
LATE-reweighting is limited by which observables are available, but MTE-reweighting effectively allows me to extrapolate from Oregon to Massachusetts using an unobservable that
captures health. This unobservable is important because treatment effects vary with health
and Massachusetts compliers are healthier than Oregon compliers.

Conclusion

I aim to shed light on why ER utilization increased following the Oregon Health Insurance
Experiment but decreased following the Massachusetts reform. Starting from the Oregon
26

Health Insurance Experiment as the “gold standard,” I find selection heterogeneity across
the unobservable that separates always takers, compliers, and never takers: ER utilization
decreases and health improves from always takers to compliers to never takers. I also find
treatment effect heterogeneity: the effect of insurance on ER utilization decreases always
takers to compliers to never takers. Differences in health explain this treatment effect heterogeneity. Although Oregon compliers increase their ER utilization upon gaining coverage,
Oregon never takers, who are healthier, would decrease their ER utilization upon gaining
coverage.
After demonstrating similar selection and treatment effect heterogeneity in the Massachusetts context, I extrapolate my findings from within the Oregon experiment to the
Massachusetts reform. Given higher levels of coverage in Massachusetts, Massachusetts
compliers are comparable to a subset of Oregon never takers. Like Oregon never takers,
Massachusetts compliers report better health than Oregon compliers. Upon gaining coverage, individuals in worse health – Oregon compliers – increase their ER utilization, while
individuals in better health – Oregon never takers and Massachusetts compliers – decrease
their ER utilization. Therefore, even though the results seem contradictory, I can reconcile
the increase in ER utilization induced by the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment with the
decrease in ER utilization induced by the Massachusetts reform.

Proof that UD is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1

Per the “probability integral transformation” (see Casella and Berger (2002, page 54)), the
cumulative distribution function of any random variable applied to itself must be distributed
uniformly between 0 and 1. Therefore, the uniformity of UD is not a separate assumption
of the model. A random variable Y is distributed uniformly between 0 and 1 if and only if
FY (c) = c for 0 ≤ c ≤ 1. Therefore, the following shows that UD is distributed uniformly
between 0 and 1, where I omit conditioning on X for simplicity:
FUD (u) = P (UD ≤ u)
= P (F (νD ) ≤ u)

= P (νD ≤ F −1 (u))
= F (F −1 (u)) = u.

Derivation of Average Outcomes and Observables

Imbens and Rubin (1997), Katz et al. (2001), Abadie (2002), and Abadie (2003) rely on the
LATE assumptions to calculate average outcomes and observables of always takers, compliers, and never takers. For consistency with my exposition, I perform the same calculations
using the MTE model that assumes no more than the LATE assumptions. I build intuition
with a graphical illustration that follows from the model.
I identify the expected value of YT for always takers as follows, supressing X for simplicity:
E[Y | D = 1, Z = 0] = E[YU + D(YT − YU ) | D = 1, Z = 0]

(by (6))

= E[YT | D = 1, Z = 0]
= E[YT | 0 ≤ UD ≤ pC , Z = 0] (by (5), where pC = P (D = 1|Z = 0))
= E[gT (UD , γT ) | 0 ≤ UD ≤ pC , Z = 0]
= E[gT (UD , γT ) | 0 ≤ UD ≤ pC ]

(by (7))
(Z ⊥ (UD , γT ) by (A.2))

= E[YT | 0 ≤ UD ≤ pC ].
I use similar steps to calculate the expected value of YT for lottery winners enrolled in

Medicaid, E[YT | 0 ≤ UD ≤ pI ] = E[Y | D = 1, Z = 1], the expected value of YU for never
takers, E[YU | pI < UD ≤ 1] = E[Y | D = 0, Z = 1], and the expected value of YU for lottery
losers not enrolled in Medicaid, E[YU | pC < UD ≤ 1] = E[Y | D = 0, Z = 0]. I then use the
four resulting values to calculate the expected value of YT for compliers enrolled in Medicaid:

I illustrate the calculations graphically using values from Oregon data in Figure C1. I
use bolded dotted lines to depict average ER utilization when enrolled in Medicaid, YT ,
for two observed groups: lottery losers enrolled in Medicaid (0 ≤ UD ≤ pC ) and lottery
winners enrolled in Medicaid (0 ≤ UD ≤ pI ). I use bolded dashed lines to depict average
ER utilization when not enrolled in Medicaid, YU , for two observed groups: lottery losers
not enrolled in Medicaid (pC < UD ≤ 1) and lottery winners not enrolled in Medicaid

To calculate the average observable X for each group, I begin with the same approach.
Even though average outcomes of compliers should depend on whether they win or lose
the lottery, average observables of compliers should not. Therefore, I weight the average

Estimating MTO(x, p), MUO(x, p), and MTE(x, p)

The steps below estimate the functions MTO(x, p), MUO(x, p), and MTE(x, p) of the form
MTO(x, p) = δT0 x + λT p
MUO(x, p) = δU0 x + λU p
MTE(x, p) = MTO(x, p) − MUO(x, p)

= (δT0 − δU0 ) x + (λT − λU ) p.

1. Estimate propensity scores, pb, for all individuals in the sample by fitting
D = φ0 + φ1 Z + φ02 X + φ03 (X 0 Z) + ε
and using φb0 , φb1 , φb2 , and φb3 to predict D conditional on Z and observables X.
2. The MTO function can be derived from the average treated outcome (ATO) function,
defined as follows:
ATO(x, p) = E [YT | X = x, 0 ≤ UD ≤ p]

The ATO function can be estimated directly by conditioning the sample on treated
individuals (D = 1) and using OLS to estimate:

Therefore,

The AUO function can be estimated directly by conditioning the sample on untreated

To recover the parameters of the MUO function from the estimated parameters of the
