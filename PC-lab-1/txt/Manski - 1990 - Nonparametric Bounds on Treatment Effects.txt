Nonparametric Bounds on Treatment Effects
By CHARLES F. MANSKI*
Assumethat each memberof a population
is characterizedby values for the variables
(YA, YB' Z, x). Here x is a vectordescribinga
person and z is a binaryvariableindicating
which of two treatmentsthis personreceives.
The treatmentsare labelled A and B. The
variablesYA and YB are scalarmeasuresof
the outcomesof the two treatments.
For example, a cancer patient might be
treatedby (A) drug therapyor (B) surgery.
The relevantoutcome y might be life span
followingtreatment.An unemployedworker
might be given (A) vocational training or
(B) job searchassistance.Here the relevant
outcome might be labor force status following treatment.
Assume that a random sample is drawn
and that one observes the realizationsof
(z, x) and of the outcome under the treatment received.Thus YA is observedif treatment A is receivedbut is a latentvariableif
treatment B is received. Similarly, YB is
eitherobservedor latent.
Suppose that one wants to learn the difference in expected outcome if all persons
with attributesx wereassignedto treatment
A or B. This "treatmenteffect"is

ment-selectionprobabilitiesP(z Ix). But, the
sampling process does not identify E(yA Ix, z
= B) and E(zBIX, z = A). Henceit does not

identify the treatmenteffect.
An extensive literatureon the estimation
of treatmenteffectsbringsto bear prior informationthat, in conjunctionwith the sampling process, does identify t(x). (See, for
example, G. S. Maddala,1983, and James
Heckman and Richard Robb, 1985.) Two
approaches have been dominant. One assumes that, conditionalon x, YA and YBare
mean-independent of z (i.e., E(yA Ix, z = A)
= E(yAIx, z = B) and E(yBIx, z = A) =
E(yBIx, z = B)). This assumption,routinely

invokedin experimentswith randomassignment to treatment,impliesthat
(2)

t(x) = E(yBIx, z = B)
z = A).

The second approachimposesidentifyingremodelexstrictionsthrougha latent-variable
plaining treatmentselectionsand outcomes.
The latent-variable-model
approachis widely
used in settingswherepeople self-selectinto
treatment.
Suppose that one cannot confidentlyassert mean-independence,an identifyinglatent-variablemodel, or any other restriction
that identifiesthe treatmenteffect. It might
then seem that usefulinferenceis impossible.
This paper proves otherwise.Section I applies resultsfrom my earlierpaper(1989) to
show that an informativebound on the
treatment effect holds whenever the out-

E(yB Ix, z = B). It also identifies the treat-

SELECTIVITY BIAS

The remainderof this section describesa
class of applications in which the bound
T(x) is particularlyuseful-binary logical
outcomes.
In many applications,the treatmentoutcome is a logical yes/no indicator,taking
the value one or zero. For example, the
outcome of a medical treatment may be

If (8) holds, the bound T(x) obtainedin
Section I can be tightened.By (8),
(9)

E(yAIx, z = B) = E(yAIx, yA < YB)

< E(YAIX, YA> YB)
= E(yAIx, z = A)

(cured = 1, not cured = 0); the outcome of a
E(yBIx, z = A) = E(yBIx, yB < yA)

vocational training programmay be (completed = 1, not completed = 0). In both cases,
= KBx = 1, so the
KAoX= KBoX= 0 and KA1X

treatment effect must lie in the interval
[-1,1]. The expected value of a one/zero
indicatoris the probabilitythat the indicator
equals one. So the bound T(x) reducesto

The bound width is w(x) =1.
Binary logical variablesare bounded by
definitionratherthan by assumption.So we
find that the samplingprocess alone, unaccompaniedby prior information,sufficesto
bound the treatmenteffect to one-half its
otherwisepossible range.

= E(yBIx, z = B).

Thus E(yAIx,z=A)
and E(yBIx,z=B)
are upper bounds on E(yAIx, z = B) and
E(YBjx, z = A), respectively.The conditions
E(yAIx,z=A) <KA1X and E(yBIx,z = B)
< KBx must hold. Hence knowingthat (8)
holds permits one to tighten the bound (4)
on the treatmenteffectto

The tightened bound may or may not lie
entirely to one side of zero. If it does, the

yA.

For example, a doctor may prescribethe

unemployedworkermay choosethe employment programwith the higherreturn.

The bound T(x) on the treatmenteffectat
a given value of x does not constrainthe
treatmenteffect elsewhere.This is to be expected as no restrictionshave been imposed
on the behaviorof t(x) as a functionof x.
Suppose that one has informationon the
way t(x), or its determinants,vary with x.
Then one may be able to obtain a bound
tighterthan T(x).

where X is the set of all possible values of x.
An important special case is the exclusion

component, one that affects neither

B. Level-Set Restrictionson
the OutcomeRegressions
Suppose it is known that E(yA Ix) is constant on some set XAOC X, and that E(yB Ix)
is constant on some XBOc X. (This includes
cases in which one of the restrictions is trivial; the set XBO, for example, might contain
just one point.) Let XABO XAOn XBO. The

reasoning used in Section A above implies
that, for each ( E XABO, the bounds YA(()
and YB(() defined in (3) can be tightened to

nor E(yBIx, z = B). A restriction excluding
this component from the treatment effect has
no bite.
Although TO(Xo) improves on T(x), it
typically does not fix the sign of the treatment effect. If T(x) covers zero for all x e
XO, then so does TO(Xo).It was pointed out
in Section I that T(x) does cover zero whenever the bounds on YA and YB are the same.

A. Level-Set Restrictionson
the TreatmentEffect
It is often assumed in applications that the
treatment effect does not vary with x. In
particular, many studies specify a linear
model with E(yAI x) = x/3 and E(yBix) =
xfi + a, implying that t(x) = a. The assumption that t(x) is constant on all of X is a
leading example of a level-set restriction.
Suppose it is known that t(x) is constant
on some set XO. Then the collection of
bounds T(x), x E XO must have a non-null
intersection that contains the common value
of the treatment effect. That is, for each

IV. Estimationof the Bounds

The bounds developedin Sections I, II,
and III are functions of E(yAIx, z = A),
E(yBIx, z = B), and P(z Ix). These quantities are identified by the samplingprocess

323

and so generally can be estimated consistently.
If the conditioningvariablex takesfinitely many values, estimation is classical.
E(yA Ix, z = A), E(yBIx, z = B), and P(zlx)
can be estimatedby the correspondingsample averages.T(x) can be estimatedby inserting these averagesinto (4) or (10), as
appropriate.TO(XO),
being a finite intersection of the T(x), can be estimatedby the
intersection of the estimatesof T(x). Assuming that the level-setrestrictionon t(x)
is correct,this intersectionis nonemptywith
probabilityapproachingone as the sample
size increases.The bound TABO(XABO)
can be
estimatedsimilarly.
If x has continuous components, nonparametricregressionmethods may be applied to estimate E(yAIx, z = A), E(yBIx, z
= B), and P(z Ix). My earlierpaperexposits
the main issues and presents an empirical
illustrationestimatingthe bound YA(x)on
E(yAlx). This work can be applied directly
to estimate the bound T(x). Estimationof
TO(XO)is a more subtle problem,because
this boundis the intersectionof the infinitely
many bounds T(x), x E XO.A plausibleapproach, that warrantsstudy, is to estimate
Here N is the samplesize and XNO,
TO(XNO).
N = 1,..., o is a sequenceof finitesubsetsof
XO,chosen to convergeto a set dense in XO.
The bound TABO(XABO)could be estimated
similarly.
