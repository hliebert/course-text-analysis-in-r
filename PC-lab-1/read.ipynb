Introduction\\nThis paper formulates and estimates an econometric model for evaluating social\\nprograms when outcomes are discrete and responses to treatment vary among\\nobservationally identical persons. The model can be used to generate a variety of\\nmean treatment effects (treatment on the treated, the average treatment effect and the\\nmarginal treatment effect) from a common set of parameters as well as distributions\\nof treatment effects deﬁned on various subpopulations. The latent variables that\\ngenerate our model can be used to capture the essential features of a variety of wellposed economic models and allow us to bridge the literatures on structural estimation\\nand program evaluation. Estimates produced from our model are economically\\ninterpretable and can be used to conduct out-of-sample forecasts and to pool\\nevidence across studies—the usual beneﬁts of a structural econometric approach.\\nDiscrete outcomes arise in analyses of employment, health and migration. Yet a\\nsubstantial amount of research in the evaluation literature assumes outcomes are\\ncontinuous or makes special assumptions for analysis of discrete data outcomes.\\n(see, e.g., Card and Sullivan, 1988; Gritz, 1993; Gay and Borus, 1980; Heckman and\\nRobb, 1985; Ham and Lalonde, 1996; Ridder, 1986). The methodology we propose\\nand implement in this paper and a companion technical paper (Aakvik et al., 1999) is\\nsufﬁciently ﬂexible to accommodate discrete, continuous and mixed discretecontinuous outcome (e.g. Tobit) variables and can be generalized to panel data\\nsettings. (see Carneiro et al., 2003). In this paper, we focus on single-period models\\nwith discrete outcomes.\\nWe apply our methods to estimate the impact of Norwegian Vocational\\nRehabilitation Programs (VR) on employment for female applicants.

The primary\\ngoal of these programs is to allow recently disabled persons to reenter the labor force.\\nWe use this application to illustrate how our methodology can address four\\nquestions: (1) What is the overall effect of training on employment probabilities?

Abadie / Journal of Econometrics 113 (2003) 231 – 263\\n\\nA variety of methods have been proposed to overcome the selection problem (for\\na review see Heckman and Robb, 1985). The traditional approach relies on distributional assumptions and functional form restrictions to identify average treatment e(ects\\nand other treatment parameters of interest. Unfortunately, estimators based on this approach can be seriously biased by modest departures from the parametric assumptions\\n(Goldberger, 1983). In addition, a number of researchers have noted that strong parametric assumptions are not necessary to identify treatment parameters of interest (see\\ne.g., Heckman, 1990; Imbens and Angrist, 1994; Manski, 1997). Consequently, it is\\ndesirable to develop robust estimators of treatment parameters based on nonparametric\\nor semiparametric identi.cation procedures.\\nMotivated by these considerations, this article introduces a new class of instrumental\\nvariable (IV) estimators of linear and nonlinear average treatment response models with\\ncovariates. In the spirit of Roehrig (1988), identi.cation is attained nonparametrically\\nand does not depend on the choice of the parametric speci.cation for the response function of interest. The main advantage of this approach is that it allows the researcher to\\nconstruct estimators that can be interpreted as the parameters of a well-de.ned approximation to a treatment response function under functional form misspeci.cation. On the\\nother hand, if required, functional form restrictions and distributional assumptions can\\nbe accommodated in the analysis. As in the IV model of Imbens and Angrist (1994)\\nand Angrist et al. (1996), identi.cation comes from a binary instrument that induces\\nexogenous selection into treatment for some subset of the population. In contrast with\\nImbens and Angrist (1994) and Angrist et al. (1996), the approach taken here easily\\naccommodates covariates and can be used to estimate nonlinear models with a binary\\nendogenous regressor.\\nThe ability to control for covariates is important because instruments may require\\nconditioning on a set of covariates to be valid. Covariates can also be used to re7ect\\nobservable di(erences in the composition of populations, making extrapolation more\\ncredible. Another feature of the approach taken here, the ability to estimate nonlinear models, is important because in some cases, such as evaluation problems with\\nlimited dependent variables, the underlying response function of interest is inherently\\nnonlinear. As a by-product of the general framework introduced here, I develop an\\nIV estimator that provides a linear least squares approximation to an average treatment resp'</li>\n",

For personal use only.\\n\\nThe nature of empirical research in economics has profoundly changed since the emergence in the\\n1990s of a new way to understand identification in econometric models. This approach emphasizes\\nthe importance of heterogeneity across units in the parameters of interest and of the choice of the\\nsources of variation in the data that are used to estimate those parameters. Initial impetus came from\\nempirical research by Angrist, Ashenfelter, Card, Krueger and others, while Angrist, Heckman,\\nImbens, Manski, Rubin, and others provided many of the early methodological innovations (see, in\\nparticular, Angrist 1990, Angrist &amp; Krueger 1991, Angrist et al. 1996, Card 1990, Card &amp; Krueger\\n1994, Heckman 1990, Manski 1990; for earlier contributions, see Ashenfelter 1978, Ashenfelter\\n&amp; Card 1985, Heckman &amp; Robb 1985).\\nWhile this greater emphasis on identification has permeated all brands of econometrics and\\nquantitative social science, nowhere have the effects been felt more profoundly than in the field\\nof program evaluation—a domain expanding the social, biomedical, and behavioral sciences that\\nstudies the effects of policy interventions. The policies of interest are often governmental programs, like active labor market interventions or antipoverty programs. In other instances, the term\\npolicy is more generally understood to include any intervention of interest by public or private\\nagents or by nature.\\nIn this article, we offer an overview of classical tools and recent developments in the econometrics of program evaluation and discuss potential avenues for future research. Our focus is on ex\\npost evaluation exercises, where the effects of a policy intervention are evaluated after some form\\nof the intervention (such as a regular implementation of the policy, an experimental study, or a\\npilot study) is deployed and the relevant outcomes under the intervention are measured. Many\\nstudies in economics and the social sciences aim to evaluate existing or experimentally deployed\\ninterventions, and the methods surveyed in this article have been shown to have broad applicability\\nin these settings. In many other cases, however, economists and social scientists are interested in\\nex ante evaluation exercises, that is, in estimating the effect of a policy before such policy is implemented on the population of interest (e.g., Todd &amp; Wolpin 2010). In the absence of measures\\nof the outcomes under the intervention of interest, ex ante evaluations aim to extrapolate outside\\nthe support of the data. Often, economic models that precisely describe the behavior of economic\\nagents serve as useful extrapolation devices for ex ante evaluations. Methods that are suitable for\\nex ante evaluation have been previously covered in the Annual Review of Economics (Arcidiacono &amp;\\nEllickson 2011, Berry &amp; Haile 2016).\\nThis distinction between ex ante and ex post program evaluations is closely related to oftendiscussed differences between the so-called structural and causal inference schools in econometrics.\\nThe use of economic models as devices to extrapolate outside the support of the data in ex ante\\nprogram evaluation is typically associated with the structural school, while ex post evaluations\\nthat do not explicitly extrapolate using economic models of behavior are often termed causal or\\nreduced form.1 Given that they serve related but quite distinct purposes, we find the perceived\\nconflict between these two schools to be '</li>\n",

If in reality, they do not have to pay γ (q) and the demand for m has a nonzero income\\textbackslash{}nelasticity, the observed choices of m will differ from those used in this derivation and, as a result,\\textbackslash{}nthis derivation is not exact. In practice, however, this issue does not affect our estimates because\\textbackslash{}nour estimates are based on a linear interpolation of dγ/dq between q = 0 and q = 1. At q = 0, γ\\textbackslash{}nis zero and therefore the observed choices of m are the same whether or not individuals have to\\textbackslash{}npay γ. At q = 1, individuals are fully insured and the marginal insurance value is zero in any case.\\textbackslash{}nThe only estimate for which this issue does arise is the specification check discussed in column VI\\textbackslash{}nof Appendix Table 4, in which we do not assume that individuals are fully insured at q = 1 (i.e.,\\textbackslash{}nwhere they have strictly positive out-of-pocket spending at q = 1).

Introduction\\textbackslash{}nThis paper formulates and estimates an econometric model for evaluating social\\textbackslash{}nprograms when outcomes are discrete and responses to treatment vary among\\textbackslash{}nobservationally identical persons. The model can be used to generate a variety of\\textbackslash{}nmean treatment effects (treatment on the treated, the average treatment effect and the\\textbackslash{}nmarginal treatment effect) from a common set of parameters as well as distributions\\textbackslash{}nof treatment effects deﬁned on various subpopulations. The latent variables that\\textbackslash{}ngenerate our model can be used to capture the essential features of a variety of wellposed economic models and allow us to bridge the literatures on structural estimation\\textbackslash{}nand program evaluation. Estimates produced from our model are economically\\textbackslash{}ninterpretable and can be used to conduct out-of-sample forecasts and to pool\\textbackslash{}nevidence across studies—the usual beneﬁts of a structural econometric approach.\\textbackslash{}nDiscrete outcomes arise in analyses of employment, health and migration. Yet a\\textbackslash{}nsubstantial amount of research in the evaluation literature assumes outcomes are\\textbackslash{}ncontinuous or makes special assumptions for analysis of discrete data outcomes.\\textbackslash{}n(see, e.g., Card and Sullivan, 1988; Gritz, 1993; Gay and Borus, 1980; Heckman and\\textbackslash{}nRobb, 1985; Ham and Lalonde, 1996; Ridder, 1986). The methodology we propose\\textbackslash{}nand implement in this paper and a companion technical paper (Aakvik et al., 1999) is\\textbackslash{}nsufﬁciently ﬂexible to accommodate discrete, continuous and mixed discretecontinuous outcome (e.g. Tobit) variables and can be generalized to panel data\\textbackslash{}nsettings. (see Carneiro et al., 2003). In this paper, we focus on single-period models\\textbackslash{}nwith discrete outcomes.\\textbackslash{}nWe apply our methods to estimate the impact of Norwegian Vocational\\textbackslash{}nRehabilitation Programs (VR) on employment for female applicants. These\\textbackslash{}nprograms offer income maintenance payments and training programs to individuals\\textbackslash{}nwhose medical conditions result in reduced productivity in the labor market and\\textbackslash{}nwhom program administrators believe will beneﬁt from these services. The primary\\textbackslash{}ngoal of these programs is to allow recently disabled persons to reenter the labor force.\\textbackslash{}nWe use this application to illustrate how our methodology can address four\\textbackslash{}nquestions: (1) What is the overall effect of training on employment probabilities? (2)\\textbackslash{}nWhich groups of individuals beneﬁt most from participation in training? (3) How\\textbackslash{}nimportant is it to control for unobservables in understanding the selection and\\textbackslash{}noutcome processes? (4) What are the effects of applicants’ observed and unobserved\\textbackslash{}ncharacteristics on the administrative decision to accept applicants into an on-going\\textbackslash{}ntraining program?\\textbackslash{}nAt ﬁrst glance, the Norw'\n",

These tests and estimators are applied to the study\\textbackslash{}nof the effects of veteran status on the distribution of civilian earnings.

Introduction\\textbackslash{}nEconomists have long been concerned with the problem of how to estimate the e(ect\\textbackslash{}nof a treatment on some outcome of interest, possibly after conditioning on a vector of\\textbackslash{}ncovariates. The main empirical challenge in studies of this type arises from the fact\\textbackslash{}nthat selection for treatment is usually related to the potential outcomes that individuals\\textbackslash{}nwould attain with and without the treatment. Therefore, systematic di(erences in the\\textbackslash{}ndistribution of the outcome variable between treated and non-treated may re7ect not\\textbackslash{}nonly the e(ect of the treatment, but also di(erences generated by the selection process.\\textbackslash{}n∗\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}nTel.: +1-617-496-4547; fax: +1-617-496-5960.\\textbackslash{}nE-mail address: alberto abadie@harvard.edu (A.

Abadie / Journal of Econometrics 113 (2003) 231 – 263\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}nA variety of methods have been proposed to overcome the selection problem (for\\textbackslash{}na review see Heckman and Robb, 1985). The traditional approach relies on distributional assumptions and functional form restrictions to identify average treatment e(ects\\textbackslash{}nand other treatment parameters of interest. Unfortunately, estimators based on this approach can be seriously biased by modest departures from the parametric assumptions\\textbackslash{}n(Goldberger, 1983). In addition, a number of researchers have noted that strong parametric assumptions are not necessary to identify treatment parameters of interest (see\\textbackslash{}ne.g., Heckman, 1990; Imbens and Angrist, 1994; Manski, 1997). Consequently, it is\\textbackslash{}ndesirable to develop robust estimators of treatment parameters based on nonparametric\\textbackslash{}nor semiparametric identi.cation procedures.\\textbackslash{}nMotivated by these considerations, this article introduces a new class of instrumental\\textbackslash{}nvariable (IV) estimators of linear and nonlinear average treatment response models with\\textbackslash{}ncovariates. In the spirit of Roehrig (1988), identi.cation is attained nonparametrically\\textbackslash{}nand does not depend on the choice of the parametric speci.cation for the response function of interest. The main advantage of this approach is that it allows the researcher to\\textbackslash{}nconstruct estimators that can be interpreted as the parameters of a well-de.ned approximation to a treatment response function under functional form misspeci.cation. On the\\textbackslash{}nother hand, if required, functional form restrictions and distributional assumptions can\\textbackslash{}nbe accommodated in the analysis. As in the IV model of Imbens and Angrist (1994)\\textbackslash{}nand Angrist et al. (1996), identi.cation comes from a binary instrument that induces\\textbackslash{}nexogenous selection into treatment for some subset of the population. In contrast with\\textbackslash{}nImbens and Angrist (1994) and Angrist et al. (1996), the approach taken here easily\\textbackslash{}naccommodates covariates and can be used to estimate nonlinear models with a binary\\textbackslash{}nendogenous regressor.\\textbackslash{}nThe ability to control for covariates is important because instruments may require\\textbackslash{}nconditioning on a set of covariates to be valid. Covariates can also be used to re7ect\\textbackslash{}nobservable di(erences in the composition of populations, making extrapolation more\\textbackslash{}ncredible. Another feature of the approach taken here, the ability to estimate nonlinear models, is important because in some cases, such as evaluation problems with\\textbackslash{}nlimited dependent variables, the underlying response function of interest is inherently\\textbackslash{}nnonlinear. As a by-product of the general framework introduced here, I develop an\\textbackslash{}nIV estimator that provides a linear least squares approximation to an average treatment resp'\n",

This approach emphasizes\\textbackslash{}nthe importance of heterogeneity across units in the parameters of interest and of the choice of the\\textbackslash{}nsources of variation in the data that are used to estimate those parameters. Initial impetus came from\\textbackslash{}nempirical research by Angrist, Ashenfelter, Card, Krueger and others, while Angrist, Heckman,\\textbackslash{}nImbens, Manski, Rubin, and others provided many of the early methodological innovations (see, in\\textbackslash{}nparticular, Angrist 1990, Angrist \\& Krueger 1991, Angrist et al. 1996, Card 1990, Card \\& Krueger\\textbackslash{}n1994, Heckman 1990, Manski 1990; for earlier contributions, see Ashenfelter 1978, Ashenfelter\\textbackslash{}n\\& Card 1985, Heckman \\& Robb 1985).\\textbackslash{}nWhile this greater emphasis on identification has permeated all brands of econometrics and\\textbackslash{}nquantitative social science, nowhere have the effects been felt more profoundly than in the field\\textbackslash{}nof program evaluation—a domain expanding the social, biomedical, and behavioral sciences that\\textbackslash{}nstudies the effects of policy interventions. The policies of interest are often governmental programs, like active labor market interventions or antipoverty programs. In other instances, the term\\textbackslash{}npolicy is more generally understood to include any intervention of interest by public or private\\textbackslash{}nagents or by nature.\\textbackslash{}nIn this article, we offer an overview of classical tools and recent developments in the econometrics of program evaluation and discuss potential avenues for future research. Our focus is on ex\\textbackslash{}npost evaluation exercises, where the effects of a policy intervention are evaluated after some form\\textbackslash{}nof the intervention (such as a regular implementation of the policy, an experimental study, or a\\textbackslash{}npilot study) is deployed and the relevant outcomes under the intervention are measured. Many\\textbackslash{}nstudies in economics and the social sciences aim to evaluate existing or experimentally deployed\\textbackslash{}ninterventions, and the methods surveyed in this article have been shown to have broad applicability\\textbackslash{}nin these settings. In many other cases, however, economists and social scientists are interested in\\textbackslash{}nex ante evaluation exercises, that is, in estimating the effect of a policy before such policy is implemented on the population of interest (e.g., Todd \\& Wolpin 2010). In the absence of measures\\textbackslash{}nof the outcomes under the intervention of interest, ex ante evaluations aim to extrapolate outside\\textbackslash{}nthe support of the data. Often, economic models that precisely describe the behavior of economic\\textbackslash{}nagents serve as useful extrapolation devices for ex ante evaluations. Methods that are suitable for\\textbackslash{}nex ante evaluation have been previously covered in the Annual Review of Economics (Arcidiacono \\&\\textbackslash{}nEllickson 2011, Berry \\& Haile 2016).\\textbackslash{}nThis distinction between ex ante and ex post program evaluations is closely related to oftendiscussed differences between the so-called structural and causal inference schools in econometrics.\\textbackslash{}nThe use of economic models as devices to extrapolate outside the support of the data in ex ante\\textbackslash{}nprogram evaluation is typically associated with the structural school, while ex post evaluations\\textbackslash{}nthat do not explicitly extrapolate using economic models of behavior are often termed causal or\\textbackslash{}nreduced form.1 Given that they serve related but quite distinct purposes, we find the perceived\\textbackslash{}nconflict between these two schools to be '\n",

Introduction\\nThis paper formulates and estimates an econometric model for evaluating social\\nprograms when outcomes are discrete and responses to treatment vary among\\nobservationally identical persons. The model can be used to generate a variety of\\nmean treatment effects (treatment on the treated, the average treatment effect and the\\nmarginal treatment effect) from a common set of parameters as well as distributions\\nof treatment effects deﬁned on various subpopulations. The latent variables that\\ngenerate our model can be used to capture the essential features of a variety of wellposed economic models and allow us to bridge the literatures on structural estimation\\nand program evaluation. Estimates produced from our model are economically\\ninterpretable and can be used to conduct out-of-sample forecasts and to pool\\nevidence across studies—the usual beneﬁts of a structural econometric approach.\\nDiscrete outcomes arise in analyses of employment, health and migration. Yet a\\nsubstantial amount of research in the evaluation literature assumes outcomes are\\ncontinuous or makes special assumptions for analysis of discrete data outcomes.\\n(see, e.g., Card and Sullivan, 1988; Gritz, 1993; Gay and Borus, 1980; Heckman and\\nRobb, 1985; Ham and Lalonde, 1996; Ridder, 1986). The methodology we propose\\nand implement in this paper and a companion technical paper (Aakvik et al., 1999) is\\nsufﬁciently ﬂexible to accommodate discrete, continuous and mixed discretecontinuous outcome (e.g. Tobit) variables and can be generalized to panel data\\nsettings. (see Carneiro et al., 2003). In this paper, we focus on single-period models\\nwith discrete outcomes.\\nWe apply our methods to estimate the impact of Norwegian Vocational\\nRehabilitation Programs (VR) on employment for female applicants. These\\nprograms offer income maintenance payments and training programs to individuals\\nwhose medical conditions result in reduced productivity in the labor market and\\nwhom program administrators believe will beneﬁt from these services. The primary\\ngoal of these programs is to allow recently disabled persons to reenter the labor force.\\nWe use this application to illustrate how our methodology can address four\\nquestions: (1) What is the overall effect of training on employment probabilities? (2)\\nWhich groups of individuals beneﬁt most from participation in training? (3) How\\nimportant is it to control for unobservables in understanding the selection and\\noutcome processes?

Abadie / Journal of Econometrics 113 (2003) 231 – 263\\n\\nA variety of methods have been proposed to overcome the selection problem (for\\na review see Heckman and Robb, 1985). The traditional approach relies on distributional assumptions and functional form restrictions to identify average treatment e(ects\\nand other treatment parameters of interest. Unfortunately, estimators based on this approach can be seriously biased by modest departures from the parametric assumptions\\n(Goldberger, 1983). In addition, a number of researchers have noted that strong parametric assumptions are not necessary to identify treatment parameters of interest (see\\ne.g., Heckman, 1990; Imbens and Angrist, 1994; Manski, 1997). Consequently, it is\\ndesirable to develop robust estimators of treatment parameters based on nonparametric\\nor semiparametric identi.cation procedures.\\nMotivated by these considerations, this article introduces a new class of instrumental\\nvariable (IV) estimators of linear and nonlinear average treatment response models with\\ncovariates. In the spirit of Roehrig (1988), identi.cation is attained nonparametrically\\nand does not depend on the choice of the parametric speci.cation for the response function of interest. The main advantage of this approach is that it allows the researcher to\\nconstruct estimators that can be interpreted as the parameters of a well-de.ned approximation to a treatment response function under functional form misspeci.cation. On the\\nother hand, if required, functional form restrictions and distributional assumptions can\\nbe accommodated in the analysis. As in the IV model of Imbens and Angrist (1994)\\nand Angrist et al. (1996), identi.cation comes from a binary instrument that induces\\nexogenous selection into treatment for some subset of the population. In contrast with\\nImbens and Angrist (1994) and Angrist et al. (1996), the approach taken here easily\\naccommodates covariates and can be used to estimate nonlinear models with a binary\\nendogenous regressor.\\nThe ability to control for covariates is important because instruments may require\\nconditioning on a set of covariates to be valid. Covariates can also be used to re7ect\\nobservable di(erences in the composition of populations, making extrapolation more\\ncredible. Another feature of the approach taken here, the ability to estimate nonlinear models, is important because in some cases, such as evaluation problems with\\nlimited dependent variables, the underlying response function of interest is inherently\\nnonlinear. As a by-product of the general framework introduced here, I develop an\\nIV estimator that provides a linear least squares approximation to an average treatment resp'\n",

For personal use only.\\n\\nThe nature of empirical research in economics has profoundly changed since the emergence in the\\n1990s of a new way to understand identification in econometric models. This approach emphasizes\\nthe importance of heterogeneity across units in the parameters of interest and of the choice of the\\nsources of variation in the data that are used to estimate those parameters. Initial impetus came from\\nempirical research by Angrist, Ashenfelter, Card, Krueger and others, while Angrist, Heckman,\\nImbens, Manski, Rubin, and others provided many of the early methodological innovations (see, in\\nparticular, Angrist 1990, Angrist &amp; Krueger 1991, Angrist et al. 1996, Card 1990, Card &amp; Krueger\\n1994, Heckman 1990, Manski 1990; for earlier contributions, see Ashenfelter 1978, Ashenfelter\\n&amp; Card 1985, Heckman &amp; Robb 1985).\\nWhile this greater emphasis on identification has permeated all brands of econometrics and\\nquantitative social science, nowhere have the effects been felt more profoundly than in the field\\nof program evaluation—a domain expanding the social, biomedical, and behavioral sciences that\\nstudies the effects of policy interventions. The policies of interest are often governmental programs, like active labor market interventions or antipoverty programs. In other instances, the term\\npolicy is more generally understood to include any intervention of interest by public or private\\nagents or by nature.\\nIn this article, we offer an overview of classical tools and recent developments in the econometrics of program evaluation and discuss potential avenues for future research. Our focus is on ex\\npost evaluation exercises, where the effects of a policy intervention are evaluated after some form\\nof the intervention (such as a regular implementation of the policy, an experimental study, or a\\npilot study) is deployed and the relevant outcomes under the intervention are measured. Many\\nstudies in economics and the social sciences aim to evaluate existing or experimentally deployed\\ninterventions, and the methods surveyed in this article have been shown to have broad applicability\\nin these settings. In many other cases, however, economists and social scientists are interested in\\nex ante evaluation exercises, that is, in estimating the effect of a policy before such policy is implemented on the population of interest (e.g., Todd &amp; Wolpin 2010). In the absence of measures\\nof the outcomes under the intervention of interest, ex ante evaluations aim to extrapolate outside\\nthe support of the data. Often, economic models that precisely describe the behavior of economic\\nagents serve as useful extrapolation devices for ex ante evaluations. Methods that are suitable for\\nex ante evaluation have been previously covered in the Annual Review of Economics (Arcidiacono &amp;\\nEllickson 2011, Berry &amp; Haile 2016).\\nThis distinction between ex ante and ex post program evaluations is closely related to oftendiscussed differences between the so-called structural and causal inference schools in econometrics.\\nThe use of economic models as devices to extrapolate outside the support of the data in ex ante\\nprogram evaluation is typically associated with the structural school, while ex post evaluations\\nthat do not explicitly extrapolate using economic models of behavior are often termed causal or\\nreduced form.1 Given that they serve related but quite distinct purposes, we find the perceived\\nconflict between these two schools to be '\n",

Introduction\\nThis paper formulates and estimates an econometric model for evaluating social\\nprograms when outcomes are discrete and responses to treatment vary among\\nobservationally identical persons. The model can be used to generate a variety of\\nmean treatment effects (treatment on the treated, the average treatment effect and the\\nmarginal treatment effect) from a common set of parameters as well as distributions\\nof treatment effects deﬁned on various subpopulations. The latent variables that\\ngenerate our model can be used to capture the essential features of a variety of wellposed economic models and allow us to bridge the literatures on structural estimation\\nand program evaluation. Estimates produced from our model are economically\\ninterpretable and can be used to conduct out-of-sample forecasts and to pool\\nevidence across studies—the usual beneﬁts of a structural econometric approach.\\nDiscrete outcomes arise in analyses of employment, health and migration. Yet a\\nsubstantial amount of research in the evaluation literature assumes outcomes are\\ncontinuous or makes special assumptions for analysis of discrete data outcomes.\\n(see, e.g., Card and Sullivan, 1988; Gritz, 1993; Gay and Borus, 1980; Heckman and\\nRobb, 1985; Ham and Lalonde, 1996; Ridder, 1986).

Abadie / Journal of Econometrics 113 (2003) 231 – 263\\n\\nA variety of methods have been proposed to overcome the selection problem (for\\na review see Heckman and Robb, 1985). The traditional approach relies on distributional assumptions and functional form restrictions to identify average treatment e(ects\\nand other treatment parameters of interest. Unfortunately, estimators based on this approach can be seriously biased by modest departures from the parametric assumptions\\n(Goldberger, 1983). In addition, a number of researchers have noted that strong parametric assumptions are not necessary to identify treatment parameters of interest (see\\ne.g., Heckman, 1990; Imbens and Angrist, 1994; Manski, 1997). Consequently, it is\\ndesirable to develop robust estimators of treatment parameters based on nonparametric\\nor semiparametric identi.cation procedures.\\nMotivated by these considerations, this article introduces a new class of instrumental\\nvariable (IV) estimators of linear and nonlinear average treatment response models with\\ncovariates. In the spirit of Roehrig (1988), identi.cation is attained nonparametrically\\nand does not depend on the choice of the parametric speci.cation for the response function of interest. The main advantage of this approach is that it allows the researcher to\\nconstruct estimators that can be interpreted as the parameters of a well-de.ned approximation to a treatment response function under functional form misspeci.cation. On the\\nother hand, if required, functional form restrictions and distributional assumptions can\\nbe accommodated in the analysis. As in the IV model of Imbens and Angrist (1994)\\nand Angrist et al. (1996), identi.cation comes from a binary instrument that induces\\nexogenous selection into treatment for some subset of the population. In contrast with\\nImbens and Angrist (1994) and Angrist et al. (1996), the approach taken here easily\\naccommodates covariates and can be used to estimate nonlinear models with a binary\\nendogenous regressor.\\nThe ability to control for covariates is important because instruments may require\\nconditioning on a set of covariates to be valid. Covariates can also be used to re7ect\\nobservable di(erences in the composition of populations, making extrapolation more\\ncredible. Another feature of the approach taken here, the ability to estimate nonlinear models, is important because in some cases, such as evaluation problems with\\nlimited dependent variables, the underlying response function of interest is inherently\\nnonlinear. As a by-product of the general framework introduced here, I develop an\\nIV estimator that provides a linear least squares approximation to an average treatment resp\"\n",

For personal use only.\\n\\nThe nature of empirical research in economics has profoundly changed since the emergence in the\\n1990s of a new way to understand identification in econometric models. This approach emphasizes\\nthe importance of heterogeneity across units in the parameters of interest and of the choice of the\\nsources of variation in the data that are used to estimate those parameters. Initial impetus came from\\nempirical research by Angrist, Ashenfelter, Card, Krueger and others, while Angrist, Heckman,\\nImbens, Manski, Rubin, and others provided many of the early methodological innovations (see, in\\nparticular, Angrist 1990, Angrist & Krueger 1991, Angrist et al. 1996, Card 1990, Card & Krueger\\n1994, Heckman 1990, Manski 1990; for earlier contributions, see Ashenfelter 1978, Ashenfelter\\n& Card 1985, Heckman & Robb 1985).\\nWhile this greater emphasis on identification has permeated all brands of econometrics and\\nquantitative social science, nowhere have the effects been felt more profoundly than in the field\\nof program evaluation—a domain expanding the social, biomedical, and behavioral sciences that\\nstudies the effects of policy interventions. The policies of interest are often governmental programs, like active labor market interventions or antipoverty programs. In other instances, the term\\npolicy is more generally understood to include any intervention of interest by public or private\\nagents or by nature.\\nIn this article, we offer an overview of classical tools and recent developments in the econometrics of program evaluation and discuss potential avenues for future research. Our focus is on ex\\npost evaluation exercises, where the effects of a policy intervention are evaluated after some form\\nof the intervention (such as a regular implementation of the policy, an experimental study, or a\\npilot study) is deployed and the relevant outcomes under the intervention are measured. Many\\nstudies in economics and the social sciences aim to evaluate existing or experimentally deployed\\ninterventions, and the methods surveyed in this article have been shown to have broad applicability\\nin these settings. In many other cases, however, economists and social scientists are interested in\\nex ante evaluation exercises, that is, in estimating the effect of a policy before such policy is implemented on the population of interest (e.g., Todd & Wolpin 2010). In the absence of measures\\nof the outcomes under the intervention of interest, ex ante evaluations aim to extrapolate outside\\nthe support of the data. Often, economic models that precisely describe the behavior of economic\\nagents serve as useful extrapolation devices for ex ante evaluations. Methods that are suitable for\\nex ante evaluation have been previously covered in the Annual Review of Economics (Arcidiacono &\\nEllickson 2011, Berry & Haile 2016).\\nThis distinction between ex ante and ex post program evaluations is closely related to oftendiscussed differences between the so-called structural and causal inference schools in econometrics.\\nThe use of economic models as devices to extrapolate outside the support of the data in ex ante\\nprogram evaluation is typically associated with the structural school, while ex post evaluations\\nthat do not explicitly extrapolate using economic models of behavior are often termed causal or\\nreduced form.1 Given that they serve related but quite distinct purposes, we find the perceived\\nconflict between these two schools to be \"\n"

       "(Goldberger, 1983). In addition, a number of researchers have noted that strong parametric assumptions are not necessary to identify treatment parameters of interest (see\n",

If in reality, they do not have to pay γ (q) and the demand for m has a nonzero income\\nelasticity, the observed choices of m will differ from those used in this derivation and, as a result,\\nthis derivation is not exact.

At q = 1, individuals are fully insured and the marginal insurance value is zero in any case.\\nThe only estimate for which this issue does arise is the specification check discussed in column VI\\nof Appendix Table 4, in which we do not assume that individuals are fully insured at q = 1 (i.e.,\\nwhere they have strictly positive out-of-pocket spending at q = 1).

Introduction\\nThis paper formulates and estimates an econometric model for evaluating social\\nprograms when outcomes are discrete and responses to treatment vary among\\nobservationally identical persons. The model can be used to generate a variety of\\nmean treatment effects (treatment on the treated, the average treatment effect and the\\nmarginal treatment effect) from a common set of parameters as well as distributions\\nof treatment effects deﬁned on various subpopulations. The latent variables that\\ngenerate our model can be used to capture the essential features of a variety of wellposed economic models and allow us to bridge the literatures on structural estimation\\nand program evaluation. Estimates produced from our model are economically\\ninterpretable and can be used to conduct out-of-sample forecasts and to pool\\nevidence across studies—the usual beneﬁts of a structural econometric approach.\\nDiscrete outcomes arise in analyses of employment, health and migration. Yet a\\nsubstantial amount of research in the evaluation literature assumes outcomes are\\ncontinuous or makes special assumptions for analysis of discrete data outcomes.\\n(see, e.g., Card and Sullivan, 1988; Gritz, 1993; Gay and Borus, 1980; Heckman and\\nRobb, 1985; Ham and Lalonde, 1996; Ridder, 1986). The methodology we propose\\nand implement in this paper and a companion technical paper (Aakvik et al., 1999) is\\nsufﬁciently ﬂexible to accommodate discrete, continuous and mixed discretecontinuous outcome (e.g. Tobit) variables and can be generalized to panel data\\nsettings. (see Carneiro et al., 2003). In this paper, we focus on single-period models\\nwith discrete outcomes.\\nWe apply our methods to estimate the impact of Norwegian Vocational\\nRehabilitation Programs (VR) on employment for female applicants. These\\nprograms offer income maintenance payments and training programs to individuals\\nwhose medical conditions result in reduced productivity in the labor market and\\nwhom program administrators believe will beneﬁt from these services. The primary\\ngoal of these programs is to allow recently disabled persons to reenter the labor force.\\nWe use this application to illustrate how our methodology can address four\\nquestions: (1) What is the overall effect of training on employment probabilities? (2)\\nWhich groups of individuals beneﬁt most from participation in training? (3) How\\nimportant is it to control for unobservables in understanding the selection and\\noutcome processes?

The main empirical challenge in studies of this type arises from the fact\\nthat selection for treatment is usually related to the potential outcomes that individuals\\nwould attain with and without the treatment. Therefore, systematic di(erences in the\\ndistribution of the outcome variable between treated and non-treated may re7ect not\\nonly the e(ect of the treatment, but also di(erences generated by the selection process.\\n∗\\n\\nTel.: +1-617-496-4547; fax: +1-617-496-5960.\\nE-mail address: alberto abadie@harvard.edu (A.

Abadie / Journal of Econometrics 113 (2003) 231 – 263\\n\\nA variety of methods have been proposed to overcome the selection problem (for\\na review see Heckman and Robb, 1985). The traditional approach relies on distributional assumptions and functional form restrictions to identify average treatment e(ects\\nand other treatment parameters of interest. Unfortunately, estimators based on this approach can be seriously biased by modest departures from the parametric assumptions\\n(Goldberger, 1983). In addition, a number of researchers have noted that strong parametric assumptions are not necessary to identify treatment parameters of interest (see\\ne.g., Heckman, 1990; Imbens and Angrist, 1994; Manski, 1997). Consequently, it is\\ndesirable to develop robust estimators of treatment parameters based on nonparametric\\nor semiparametric identi.cation procedures.\\nMotivated by these considerations, this article introduces a new class of instrumental\\nvariable (IV) estimators of linear and nonlinear average treatment response models with\\ncovariates. In the spirit of Roehrig (1988), identi.cation is attained nonparametrically\\nand does not depend on the choice of the parametric speci.cation for the response function of interest. The main advantage of this approach is that it allows the researcher to\\nconstruct estimators that can be interpreted as the parameters of a well-de.ned approximation to a treatment response function under functional form misspeci.cation. On the\\nother hand, if required, functional form restrictions and distributional assumptions can\\nbe accommodated in the analysis. As in the IV model of Imbens and Angrist (1994)\\nand Angrist et al. (1996), identi.cation comes from a binary instrument that induces\\nexogenous selection into treatment for some subset of the population. In contrast with\\nImbens and Angrist (1994) and Angrist et al. (1996), the approach taken here easily\\naccommodates covariates and can be used to estimate nonlinear models with a binary\\nendogenous regressor.\\nThe ability to control for covariates is important because instruments may require\\nconditioning on a set of covariates to be valid. Covariates can also be used to re7ect\\nobservable di(erences in the composition of populations, making extrapolation more\\ncredible. Another feature of the approach taken here, the ability to estimate nonlinear models, is important because in some cases, such as evaluation problems with\\nlimited dependent variables, the underlying response function of interest is inherently\\nnonlinear. As a by-product of the general framework introduced here, I develop an\\nIV estimator that provides a linear least squares approximation to an average treatment resp                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

For personal use only.\\n\\nThe nature of empirical research in economics has profoundly changed since the emergence in the\\n1990s of a new way to understand identification in econometric models. This approach emphasizes\\nthe importance of heterogeneity across units in the parameters of interest and of the choice of the\\nsources of variation in the data that are used to estimate those parameters. Initial impetus came from\\nempirical research by Angrist, Ashenfelter, Card, Krueger and others, while Angrist, Heckman,\\nImbens, Manski, Rubin, and others provided many of the early methodological innovations (see, in\\nparticular, Angrist 1990, Angrist & Krueger 1991, Angrist et al. 1996, Card 1990, Card & Krueger\\n1994, Heckman 1990, Manski 1990; for earlier contributions, see Ashenfelter 1978, Ashenfelter\\n& Card 1985, Heckman & Robb 1985).\\nWhile this greater emphasis on identification has permeated all brands of econometrics and\\nquantitative social science, nowhere have the effects been felt more profoundly than in the field\\nof program evaluation—a domain expanding the social, biomedical, and behavioral sciences that\\nstudies the effects of policy interventions. The policies of interest are often governmental programs, like active labor market interventions or antipoverty programs. In other instances, the term\\npolicy is more generally understood to include any intervention of interest by public or private\\nagents or by nature.\\nIn this article, we offer an overview of classical tools and recent developments in the econometrics of program evaluation and discuss potential avenues for future research. Our focus is on ex\\npost evaluation exercises, where the effects of a policy intervention are evaluated after some form\\nof the intervention (such as a regular implementation of the policy, an experimental study, or a\\npilot study) is deployed and the relevant outcomes under the intervention are measured. Many\\nstudies in economics and the social sciences aim to evaluate existing or experimentally deployed\\ninterventions, and the methods surveyed in this article have been shown to have broad applicability\\nin these settings. In many other cases, however, economists and social scientists are interested in\\nex ante evaluation exercises, that is, in estimating the effect of a policy before such policy is implemented on the population of interest (e.g., Todd & Wolpin 2010). In the absence of measures\\nof the outcomes under the intervention of interest, ex ante evaluations aim to extrapolate outside\\nthe support of the data. Often, economic models that precisely describe the behavior of economic\\nagents serve as useful extrapolation devices for ex ante evaluations. Methods that are suitable for\\nex ante evaluation have been previously covered in the Annual Review of Economics (Arcidiacono &\\nEllickson 2011, Berry & Haile 2016).\\nThis distinction between ex ante and ex post program evaluations is closely related to oftendiscussed differences between the so-called structural and causal inference schools in econometrics.\\nThe use of economic models as devices to extrapolate outside the support of the data in ex ante\\nprogram evaluation is typically associated with the structural school, while ex post evaluations\\nthat do not explicitly extrapolate using economic models of behavior are often termed causal or\\nreduced form.1 Given that they serve related but quite distinct purposes, we find the perceived\\nconflict between these two schools to be                                                                                                                                                               "

Introduction\\nThis paper formulates and estimates an econometric model for evaluating social\\nprograms when outcomes are discrete and responses to treatment vary among\\nobservationally identical persons. The model can be used to generate a variety of\\nmean treatment effects (treatment on the treated, the average treatment effect and the\\nmarginal treatment effect) from a common set of parameters as well as distributions\\nof treatment effects deﬁned on various subpopulations. The latent variables that\\ngenerate our model can be used to capture the essential features of a variety of wellposed economic models and allow us to bridge the literatures on structural estimation\\nand program evaluation. Estimates produced from our model are economically\\ninterpretable and can be used to conduct out-of-sample forecasts and to pool\\nevidence across studies—the usual beneﬁts of a structural econometric approach.\\nDiscrete outcomes arise in analyses of employment, health and migration. Yet a\\nsubstantial amount of research in the evaluation literature assumes outcomes are\\ncontinuous or makes special assumptions for analysis of discrete data outcomes.\\n(see, e.g., Card and Sullivan, 1988; Gritz, 1993; Gay and Borus, 1980; Heckman and\\nRobb, 1985; Ham and Lalonde, 1996; Ridder, 1986). The methodology we propose\\nand implement in this paper and a companion technical paper (Aakvik et al., 1999) is\\nsufﬁciently ﬂexible to accommodate discrete, continuous and mixed discretecontinuous outcome (e.g. Tobit) variables and can be generalized to panel data\\nsettings. (see Carneiro et al., 2003). In this paper, we focus on single-period models\\nwith discrete outcomes.\\nWe apply our methods to estimate the impact of Norwegian Vocational\\nRehabilitation Programs (VR) on employment for female applicants. These\\nprograms offer income maintenance payments and training programs to individuals\\nwhose medical conditions result in reduced productivity in the labor market and\\nwhom program administrators believe will beneﬁt from these services. The primary\\ngoal of these programs is to allow recently disabled persons to reenter the labor force.\\nWe use this application to illustrate how our methodology can address four\\nquestions: (1) What is the overall effect of training on employment probabilities? (2)\\nWhich groups of individuals beneﬁt most from participation in training? (3) How\\nimportant is it to control for unobservables in understanding the selection and\\noutcome processes?

Abadie / Journal of Econometrics 113 (2003) 231 – 263\\n\\nA variety of methods have been proposed to overcome the selection problem (for\\na review see Heckman and Robb, 1985). The traditional approach relies on distributional assumptions and functional form restrictions to identify average treatment e(ects\\nand other treatment parameters of interest. Unfortunately, estimators based on this approach can be seriously biased by modest departures from the parametric assumptions\\n(Goldberger, 1983). In addition, a number of researchers have noted that strong parametric assumptions are not necessary to identify treatment parameters of interest (see\\ne.g., Heckman, 1990; Imbens and Angrist, 1994; Manski, 1997). Consequently, it is\\ndesirable to develop robust estimators of treatment parameters based on nonparametric\\nor semiparametric identi.cation procedures.\\nMotivated by these considerations, this article introduces a new class of instrumental\\nvariable (IV) estimators of linear and nonlinear average treatment response models with\\ncovariates. In the spirit of Roehrig (1988), identi.cation is attained nonparametrically\\nand does not depend on the choice of the parametric speci.cation for the response function of interest. The main advantage of this approach is that it allows the researcher to\\nconstruct estimators that can be interpreted as the parameters of a well-de.ned approximation to a treatment response function under functional form misspeci.cation. On the\\nother hand, if required, functional form restrictions and distributional assumptions can\\nbe accommodated in the analysis. As in the IV model of Imbens and Angrist (1994)\\nand Angrist et al. (1996), identi.cation comes from a binary instrument that induces\\nexogenous selection into treatment for some subset of the population. In contrast with\\nImbens and Angrist (1994) and Angrist et al. (1996), the approach taken here easily\\naccommodates covariates and can be used to estimate nonlinear models with a binary\\nendogenous regressor.\\nThe ability to control for covariates is important because instruments may require\\nconditioning on a set of covariates to be valid. Covariates can also be used to re7ect\\nobservable di(erences in the composition of populations, making extrapolation more\\ncredible. Another feature of the approach taken here, the ability to estimate nonlinear models, is important because in some cases, such as evaluation problems with\\nlimited dependent variables, the underlying response function of interest is inherently\\nnonlinear. As a by-product of the general framework introduced here, I develop an\\nIV estimator that provides a linear least squares approximation to an average treatment resp                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

For personal use only.\\n\\nThe nature of empirical research in economics has profoundly changed since the emergence in the\\n1990s of a new way to understand identification in econometric models. This approach emphasizes\\nthe importance of heterogeneity across units in the parameters of interest and of the choice of the\\nsources of variation in the data that are used to estimate those parameters. Initial impetus came from\\nempirical research by Angrist, Ashenfelter, Card, Krueger and others, while Angrist, Heckman,\\nImbens, Manski, Rubin, and others provided many of the early methodological innovations (see, in\\nparticular, Angrist 1990, Angrist & Krueger 1991, Angrist et al. 1996, Card 1990, Card & Krueger\\n1994, Heckman 1990, Manski 1990; for earlier contributions, see Ashenfelter 1978, Ashenfelter\\n& Card 1985, Heckman & Robb 1985).\\nWhile this greater emphasis on identification has permeated all brands of econometrics and\\nquantitative social science, nowhere have the effects been felt more profoundly than in the field\\nof program evaluation—a domain expanding the social, biomedical, and behavioral sciences that\\nstudies the effects of policy interventions. The policies of interest are often governmental programs, like active labor market interventions or antipoverty programs. In other instances, the term\\npolicy is more generally understood to include any intervention of interest by public or private\\nagents or by nature.\\nIn this article, we offer an overview of classical tools and recent developments in the econometrics of program evaluation and discuss potential avenues for future research. Our focus is on ex\\npost evaluation exercises, where the effects of a policy intervention are evaluated after some form\\nof the intervention (such as a regular implementation of the policy, an experimental study, or a\\npilot study) is deployed and the relevant outcomes under the intervention are measured. Many\\nstudies in economics and the social sciences aim to evaluate existing or experimentally deployed\\ninterventions, and the methods surveyed in this article have been shown to have broad applicability\\nin these settings. In many other cases, however, economists and social scientists are interested in\\nex ante evaluation exercises, that is, in estimating the effect of a policy before such policy is implemented on the population of interest (e.g., Todd & Wolpin 2010). In the absence of measures\\nof the outcomes under the intervention of interest, ex ante evaluations aim to extrapolate outside\\nthe support of the data. Often, economic models that precisely describe the behavior of economic\\nagents serve as useful extrapolation devices for ex ante evaluations. Methods that are suitable for\\nex ante evaluation have been previously covered in the Annual Review of Economics (Arcidiacono &\\nEllickson 2011, Berry & Haile 2016).\\nThis distinction between ex ante and ex post program evaluations is closely related to oftendiscussed differences between the so-called structural and causal inference schools in econometrics.\\nThe use of economic models as devices to extrapolate outside the support of the data in ex ante\\nprogram evaluation is typically associated with the structural school, while ex post evaluations\\nthat do not explicitly extrapolate using economic models of behavior are often termed causal or\\nreduced form.1 Given that they serve related but quite distinct purposes, we find the perceived\\nconflict between these two schools to be                                                                                                                                                               \n",

Introduction\\nThis paper formulates and estimates an econometric model for evaluating social\\nprograms when outcomes are discrete and responses to treatment vary among\\nobservationally identical persons. The model can be used to generate a variety of\\nmean treatment effects (treatment on the treated, the average treatment effect and the\\nmarginal treatment effect) from a common set of parameters as well as distributions\\nof treatment effects deﬁned on various subpopulations. The latent variables that\\ngenerate our model can be used to capture the essential features of a variety of wellposed economic models and allow us to bridge the literatures on structural estimation\\nand program evaluation. Estimates produced from our model are economically\\ninterpretable and can be used to conduct out-of-sample forecasts and to pool\\nevidence across studies—the usual beneﬁts of a structural econometric approach.\\nDiscrete outcomes arise in analyses of employment, health and migration. Yet a\\nsubstantial amount of research in the evaluation literature assumes outcomes are\\ncontinuous or makes special assumptions for analysis of discrete data outcomes.\\n(see, e.g., Card and Sullivan, 1988; Gritz, 1993; Gay and Borus, 1980; Heckman and\\nRobb, 1985; Ham and Lalonde, 1996; Ridder, 1986). The methodology we propose\\nand implement in this paper and a companion technical paper (Aakvik et al., 1999) is\\nsufﬁciently ﬂexible to accommodate discrete, continuous and mixed discretecontinuous outcome (e.g. Tobit) variables and can be generalized to panel data\\nsettings. (see Carneiro et al., 2003). In this paper, we focus on single-period models\\nwith discrete outcomes.\\nWe apply our methods to estimate the impact of Norwegian Vocational\\nRehabilitation Programs (VR) on employment for female applicants. These\\nprograms offer income maintenance payments and training programs to individuals\\nwhose medical conditions result in reduced productivity in the labor market and\\nwhom program administrators believe will beneﬁt from these services. The primary\\ngoal of these programs is to allow recently disabled persons to reenter the labor force.\\nWe use this application to illustrate how our methodology can address four\\nquestions: (1) What is the overall effect of training on employment probabilities? (2)\\nWhich groups of individuals beneﬁt most from participation in training? (3) How\\nimportant is it to control for unobservables in understanding the selection and\\noutcome processes?

Abadie / Journal of Econometrics 113 (2003) 231 – 263\\n\\nA variety of methods have been proposed to overcome the selection problem (for\\na review see Heckman and Robb, 1985). The traditional approach relies on distributional assumptions and functional form restrictions to identify average treatment e(ects\\nand other treatment parameters of interest. Unfortunately, estimators based on this approach can be seriously biased by modest departures from the parametric assumptions\\n(Goldberger, 1983). In addition, a number of researchers have noted that strong parametric assumptions are not necessary to identify treatment parameters of interest (see\\ne.g., Heckman, 1990; Imbens and Angrist, 1994; Manski, 1997). Consequently, it is\\ndesirable to develop robust estimators of treatment parameters based on nonparametric\\nor semiparametric identi.cation procedures.\\nMotivated by these considerations, this article introduces a new class of instrumental\\nvariable (IV) estimators of linear and nonlinear average treatment response models with\\ncovariates. In the spirit of Roehrig (1988), identi.cation is attained nonparametrically\\nand does not depend on the choice of the parametric speci.cation for the response function of interest. The main advantage of this approach is that it allows the researcher to\\nconstruct estimators that can be interpreted as the parameters of a well-de.ned approximation to a treatment response function under functional form misspeci.cation. On the\\nother hand, if required, functional form restrictions and distributional assumptions can\\nbe accommodated in the analysis. As in the IV model of Imbens and Angrist (1994)\\nand Angrist et al. (1996), identi.cation comes from a binary instrument that induces\\nexogenous selection into treatment for some subset of the population. In contrast with\\nImbens and Angrist (1994) and Angrist et al. (1996), the approach taken here easily\\naccommodates covariates and can be used to estimate nonlinear models with a binary\\nendogenous regressor.\\nThe ability to control for covariates is important because instruments may require\\nconditioning on a set of covariates to be valid. Covariates can also be used to re7ect\\nobservable di(erences in the composition of populations, making extrapolation more\\ncredible. Another feature of the approach taken here, the ability to estimate nonlinear models, is important because in some cases, such as evaluation problems with\\nlimited dependent variables, the underlying response function of interest is inherently\\nnonlinear. As a by-product of the general framework introduced here, I develop an\\nIV estimator that provides a linear least squares approximation to an average treatment resp                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

For personal use only.\\n\\nThe nature of empirical research in economics has profoundly changed since the emergence in the\\n1990s of a new way to understand identification in econometric models. This approach emphasizes\\nthe importance of heterogeneity across units in the parameters of interest and of the choice of the\\nsources of variation in the data that are used to estimate those parameters. Initial impetus came from\\nempirical research by Angrist, Ashenfelter, Card, Krueger and others, while Angrist, Heckman,\\nImbens, Manski, Rubin, and others provided many of the early methodological innovations (see, in\\nparticular, Angrist 1990, Angrist & Krueger 1991, Angrist et al. 1996, Card 1990, Card & Krueger\\n1994, Heckman 1990, Manski 1990; for earlier contributions, see Ashenfelter 1978, Ashenfelter\\n& Card 1985, Heckman & Robb 1985).\\nWhile this greater emphasis on identification has permeated all brands of econometrics and\\nquantitative social science, nowhere have the effects been felt more profoundly than in the field\\nof program evaluation—a domain expanding the social, biomedical, and behavioral sciences that\\nstudies the effects of policy interventions. The policies of interest are often governmental programs, like active labor market interventions or antipoverty programs. In other instances, the term\\npolicy is more generally understood to include any intervention of interest by public or private\\nagents or by nature.\\nIn this article, we offer an overview of classical tools and recent developments in the econometrics of program evaluation and discuss potential avenues for future research. Our focus is on ex\\npost evaluation exercises, where the effects of a policy intervention are evaluated after some form\\nof the intervention (such as a regular implementation of the policy, an experimental study, or a\\npilot study) is deployed and the relevant outcomes under the intervention are measured. Many\\nstudies in economics and the social sciences aim to evaluate existing or experimentally deployed\\ninterventions, and the methods surveyed in this article have been shown to have broad applicability\\nin these settings. In many other cases, however, economists and social scientists are interested in\\nex ante evaluation exercises, that is, in estimating the effect of a policy before such policy is implemented on the population of interest (e.g., Todd & Wolpin 2010). In the absence of measures\\nof the outcomes under the intervention of interest, ex ante evaluations aim to extrapolate outside\\nthe support of the data. Often, economic models that precisely describe the behavior of economic\\nagents serve as useful extrapolation devices for ex ante evaluations. Methods that are suitable for\\nex ante evaluation have been previously covered in the Annual Review of Economics (Arcidiacono &\\nEllickson 2011, Berry & Haile 2016).\\nThis distinction between ex ante and ex post program evaluations is closely related to oftendiscussed differences between the so-called structural and causal inference schools in econometrics.\\nThe use of economic models as devices to extrapolate outside the support of the data in ex ante\\nprogram evaluation is typically associated with the structural school, while ex post evaluations\\nthat do not explicitly extrapolate using economic models of behavior are often termed causal or\\nreduced form.1 Given that they serve related but quite distinct purposes, we find the perceived\\nconflict between these two schools to be                                                                                                                                                               \n",

Introduction\\nThis paper formulates and estimates an econometric model for evaluating social\\nprograms when outcomes are discrete and responses to treatment vary among\\nobservationally identical persons. The model can be used to generate a variety of\\nmean treatment effects (treatment on the treated, the average treatment effect and the\\nmarginal treatment effect) from a common set of parameters as well as distributions\\nof treatment effects deﬁned on various subpopulations. The latent variables that\\ngenerate our model can be used to capture the essential features of a variety of wellposed economic models and allow us to bridge the literatures on structural estimation\\nand program evaluation. Estimates produced from our model are economically\\ninterpretable and can be used to conduct out-of-sample forecasts and to pool\\nevidence across studies—the usual beneﬁts of a structural econometric approach.\\nDiscrete outcomes arise in analyses of employment, health and migration. Yet a\\nsubstantial amount of research in the evaluation literature assumes outcomes are\\ncontinuous or makes special assumptions for analysis of discrete data outcomes.\\n(see, e.g., Card and Sullivan, 1988; Gritz, 1993; Gay and Borus, 1980; Heckman and\\nRobb, 1985; Ham and Lalonde, 1996; Ridder, 1986). The methodology we propose\\nand implement in this paper and a companion technical paper (Aakvik et al., 1999) is\\nsufﬁciently ﬂexible to accommodate discrete, continuous and mixed discretecontinuous outcome (e.g. Tobit) variables and can be generalized to panel data\\nsettings. (see Carneiro et al., 2003). In this paper, we focus on single-period models\\nwith discrete outcomes.\\nWe apply our methods to estimate the impact of Norwegian Vocational\\nRehabilitation Programs (VR) on employment for female applicants. These\\nprograms offer income maintenance payments and training programs to individuals\\nwhose medical conditions result in reduced productivity in the labor market and\\nwhom program administrators believe will beneﬁt from these services. The primary\\ngoal of these programs is to allow recently disabled persons to reenter the labor force.\\nWe use this application to illustrate how our methodology can address four\\nquestions: (1) What is the overall effect of training on employment probabilities? (2)\\nWhich groups of individuals beneﬁt most from participation in training? (3) How\\nimportant is it to control for unobservables in understanding the selection and\\noutcome processes?

Abadie / Journal of Econometrics 113 (2003) 231 – 263\\n\\nA variety of methods have been proposed to overcome the selection problem (for\\na review see Heckman and Robb, 1985). The traditional approach relies on distributional assumptions and functional form restrictions to identify average treatment e(ects\\nand other treatment parameters of interest. Unfortunately, estimators based on this approach can be seriously biased by modest departures from the parametric assumptions\\n(Goldberger, 1983). In addition, a number of researchers have noted that strong parametric assumptions are not necessary to identify treatment parameters of interest (see\\ne.g., Heckman, 1990; Imbens and Angrist, 1994; Manski, 1997). Consequently, it is\\ndesirable to develop robust estimators of treatment parameters based on nonparametric\\nor semiparametric identi.cation procedures.\\nMotivated by these considerations, this article introduces a new class of instrumental\\nvariable (IV) estimators of linear and nonlinear average treatment response models with\\ncovariates. In the spirit of Roehrig (1988), identi.cation is attained nonparametrically\\nand does not depend on the choice of the parametric speci.cation for the response function of interest. The main advantage of this approach is that it allows the researcher to\\nconstruct estimators that can be interpreted as the parameters of a well-de.ned approximation to a treatment response function under functional form misspeci.cation. On the\\nother hand, if required, functional form restrictions and distributional assumptions can\\nbe accommodated in the analysis. As in the IV model of Imbens and Angrist (1994)\\nand Angrist et al. (1996), identi.cation comes from a binary instrument that induces\\nexogenous selection into treatment for some subset of the population. In contrast with\\nImbens and Angrist (1994) and Angrist et al. (1996), the approach taken here easily\\naccommodates covariates and can be used to estimate nonlinear models with a binary\\nendogenous regressor.\\nThe ability to control for covariates is important because instruments may require\\nconditioning on a set of covariates to be valid. Covariates can also be used to re7ect\\nobservable di(erences in the composition of populations, making extrapolation more\\ncredible. Another feature of the approach taken here, the ability to estimate nonlinear models, is important because in some cases, such as evaluation problems with\\nlimited dependent variables, the underlying response function of interest is inherently\\nnonlinear. As a by-product of the general framework introduced here, I develop an\\nIV estimator that provides a linear least squares approximation to an average treatment resp                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

For personal use only.\\n\\nThe nature of empirical research in economics has profoundly changed since the emergence in the\\n1990s of a new way to understand identification in econometric models. This approach emphasizes\\nthe importance of heterogeneity across units in the parameters of interest and of the choice of the\\nsources of variation in the data that are used to estimate those parameters. Initial impetus came from\\nempirical research by Angrist, Ashenfelter, Card, Krueger and others, while Angrist, Heckman,\\nImbens, Manski, Rubin, and others provided many of the early methodological innovations (see, in\\nparticular, Angrist 1990, Angrist & Krueger 1991, Angrist et al. 1996, Card 1990, Card & Krueger\\n1994, Heckman 1990, Manski 1990; for earlier contributions, see Ashenfelter 1978, Ashenfelter\\n& Card 1985, Heckman & Robb 1985).\\nWhile this greater emphasis on identification has permeated all brands of econometrics and\\nquantitative social science, nowhere have the effects been felt more profoundly than in the field\\nof program evaluation—a domain expanding the social, biomedical, and behavioral sciences that\\nstudies the effects of policy interventions. The policies of interest are often governmental programs, like active labor market interventions or antipoverty programs. In other instances, the term\\npolicy is more generally understood to include any intervention of interest by public or private\\nagents or by nature.\\nIn this article, we offer an overview of classical tools and recent developments in the econometrics of program evaluation and discuss potential avenues for future research. Our focus is on ex\\npost evaluation exercises, where the effects of a policy intervention are evaluated after some form\\nof the intervention (such as a regular implementation of the policy, an experimental study, or a\\npilot study) is deployed and the relevant outcomes under the intervention are measured. Many\\nstudies in economics and the social sciences aim to evaluate existing or experimentally deployed\\ninterventions, and the methods surveyed in this article have been shown to have broad applicability\\nin these settings. In many other cases, however, economists and social scientists are interested in\\nex ante evaluation exercises, that is, in estimating the effect of a policy before such policy is implemented on the population of interest (e.g., Todd & Wolpin 2010). In the absence of measures\\nof the outcomes under the intervention of interest, ex ante evaluations aim to extrapolate outside\\nthe support of the data. Often, economic models that precisely describe the behavior of economic\\nagents serve as useful extrapolation devices for ex ante evaluations. Methods that are suitable for\\nex ante evaluation have been previously covered in the Annual Review of Economics (Arcidiacono &\\nEllickson 2011, Berry & Haile 2016).\\nThis distinction between ex ante and ex post program evaluations is closely related to oftendiscussed differences between the so-called structural and causal inference schools in econometrics.\\nThe use of economic models as devices to extrapolate outside the support of the data in ex ante\\nprogram evaluation is typically associated with the structural school, while ex post evaluations\\nthat do not explicitly extrapolate using economic models of behavior are often termed causal or\\nreduced form.1 Given that they serve related but quite distinct purposes, we find the perceived\\nconflict between these two schools to be                                                                                                                                                               \n",

Introduction\\nThis paper formulates and estimates an econometric model for evaluating social\\nprograms when outcomes are discrete and responses to treatment vary among\\nobservationally identical persons. The model can be used to generate a variety of\\nmean treatment effects (treatment on the treated, the average treatment effect and the\\nmarginal treatment effect) from a common set of parameters as well as distributions\\nof treatment effects deﬁned on various subpopulations. The latent variables that\\ngenerate our model can be used to capture the essential features of a variety of wellposed economic models and allow us to bridge the literatures on structural estimation\\nand program evaluation. Estimates produced from our model are economically\\ninterpretable and can be used to conduct out-of-sample forecasts and to pool\\nevidence across studies—the usual beneﬁts of a structural econometric approach.\\nDiscrete outcomes arise in analyses of employment, health and migration. Yet a\\nsubstantial amount of research in the evaluation literature assumes outcomes are\\ncontinuous or makes special assumptions for analysis of discrete data outcomes.\\n(see, e.g., Card and Sullivan, 1988; Gritz, 1993; Gay and Borus, 1980; Heckman and\\nRobb, 1985; Ham and Lalonde, 1996; Ridder, 1986). The methodology we propose\\nand implement in this paper and a companion technical paper (Aakvik et al., 1999) is\\nsufﬁciently ﬂexible to accommodate discrete, continuous and mixed discretecontinuous outcome (e.g. Tobit) variables and can be generalized to panel data\\nsettings. (see Carneiro et al., 2003). In this paper, we focus on single-period models\\nwith discrete outcomes.\\nWe apply our methods to estimate the impact of Norwegian Vocational\\nRehabilitation Programs (VR) on employment for female applicants. These\\nprograms offer income maintenance payments and training programs to individuals\\nwhose medical conditions result in reduced productivity in the labor market and\\nwhom program administrators believe will beneﬁt from these services. The primary\\ngoal of these programs is to allow recently disabled persons to reenter the labor force.\\nWe use this application to illustrate how our methodology can address four\\nquestions: (1) What is the overall effect of training on employment probabilities? (2)\\nWhich groups of individuals beneﬁt most from participation in training? (3) How\\nimportant is it to control for unobservables in understanding the selection and\\noutcome processes?

Abadie / Journal of Econometrics 113 (2003) 231 – 263\\n\\nA variety of methods have been proposed to overcome the selection problem (for\\na review see Heckman and Robb, 1985). The traditional approach relies on distributional assumptions and functional form restrictions to identify average treatment e(ects\\nand other treatment parameters of interest. Unfortunately, estimators based on this approach can be seriously biased by modest departures from the parametric assumptions\\n(Goldberger, 1983). In addition, a number of researchers have noted that strong parametric assumptions are not necessary to identify treatment parameters of interest (see\\ne.g., Heckman, 1990; Imbens and Angrist, 1994; Manski, 1997). Consequently, it is\\ndesirable to develop robust estimators of treatment parameters based on nonparametric\\nor semiparametric identi.cation procedures.\\nMotivated by these considerations, this article introduces a new class of instrumental\\nvariable (IV) estimators of linear and nonlinear average treatment response models with\\ncovariates. In the spirit of Roehrig (1988), identi.cation is attained nonparametrically\\nand does not depend on the choice of the parametric speci.cation for the response function of interest. The main advantage of this approach is that it allows the researcher to\\nconstruct estimators that can be interpreted as the parameters of a well-de.ned approximation to a treatment response function under functional form misspeci.cation. On the\\nother hand, if required, functional form restrictions and distributional assumptions can\\nbe accommodated in the analysis. As in the IV model of Imbens and Angrist (1994)\\nand Angrist et al. (1996), identi.cation comes from a binary instrument that induces\\nexogenous selection into treatment for some subset of the population. In contrast with\\nImbens and Angrist (1994) and Angrist et al. (1996), the approach taken here easily\\naccommodates covariates and can be used to estimate nonlinear models with a binary\\nendogenous regressor.\\nThe ability to control for covariates is important because instruments may require\\nconditioning on a set of covariates to be valid. Covariates can also be used to re7ect\\nobservable di(erences in the composition of populations, making extrapolation more\\ncredible. Another feature of the approach taken here, the ability to estimate nonlinear models, is important because in some cases, such as evaluation problems with\\nlimited dependent variables, the underlying response function of interest is inherently\\nnonlinear. As a by-product of the general framework introduced here, I develop an\\nIV estimator that provides a linear least squares approximation to an average treatment resp                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

For personal use only.\\n\\nThe nature of empirical research in economics has profoundly changed since the emergence in the\\n1990s of a new way to understand identification in econometric models. This approach emphasizes\\nthe importance of heterogeneity across units in the parameters of interest and of the choice of the\\nsources of variation in the data that are used to estimate those parameters. Initial impetus came from\\nempirical research by Angrist, Ashenfelter, Card, Krueger and others, while Angrist, Heckman,\\nImbens, Manski, Rubin, and others provided many of the early methodological innovations (see, in\\nparticular, Angrist 1990, Angrist & Krueger 1991, Angrist et al. 1996, Card 1990, Card & Krueger\\n1994, Heckman 1990, Manski 1990; for earlier contributions, see Ashenfelter 1978, Ashenfelter\\n& Card 1985, Heckman & Robb 1985).\\nWhile this greater emphasis on identification has permeated all brands of econometrics and\\nquantitative social science, nowhere have the effects been felt more profoundly than in the field\\nof program evaluation—a domain expanding the social, biomedical, and behavioral sciences that\\nstudies the effects of policy interventions. The policies of interest are often governmental programs, like active labor market interventions or antipoverty programs. In other instances, the term\\npolicy is more generally understood to include any intervention of interest by public or private\\nagents or by nature.\\nIn this article, we offer an overview of classical tools and recent developments in the econometrics of program evaluation and discuss potential avenues for future research. Our focus is on ex\\npost evaluation exercises, where the effects of a policy intervention are evaluated after some form\\nof the intervention (such as a regular implementation of the policy, an experimental study, or a\\npilot study) is deployed and the relevant outcomes under the intervention are measured. Many\\nstudies in economics and the social sciences aim to evaluate existing or experimentally deployed\\ninterventions, and the methods surveyed in this article have been shown to have broad applicability\\nin these settings. In many other cases, however, economists and social scientists are interested in\\nex ante evaluation exercises, that is, in estimating the effect of a policy before such policy is implemented on the population of interest (e.g., Todd & Wolpin 2010). In the absence of measures\\nof the outcomes under the intervention of interest, ex ante evaluations aim to extrapolate outside\\nthe support of the data. Often, economic models that precisely describe the behavior of economic\\nagents serve as useful extrapolation devices for ex ante evaluations. Methods that are suitable for\\nex ante evaluation have been previously covered in the Annual Review of Economics (Arcidiacono &\\nEllickson 2011, Berry & Haile 2016).\\nThis distinction between ex ante and ex post program evaluations is closely related to oftendiscussed differences between the so-called structural and causal inference schools in econometrics.\\nThe use of economic models as devices to extrapolate outside the support of the data in ex ante\\nprogram evaluation is typically associated with the structural school, while ex post evaluations\\nthat do not explicitly extrapolate using economic models of behavior are often termed causal or\\nreduced form.1 Given that they serve related but quite distinct purposes, we find the perceived\\nconflict between these two schools to be                                                                                                                                                               \n",

Introduction\\nThis paper formulates and estimates an econometric model for evaluating social\\nprograms when outcomes are discrete and responses to treatment vary among\\nobservationally identical persons. The model can be used to generate a variety of\\nmean treatment effects (treatment on the treated, the average treatment effect and the\\nmarginal treatment effect) from a common set of parameters as well as distributions\\nof treatment effects deﬁned on various subpopulations. The latent variables that\\ngenerate our model can be used to capture the essential features of a variety of wellposed economic models and allow us to bridge the literatures on structural estimation\\nand program evaluation. Estimates produced from our model are economically\\ninterpretable and can be used to conduct out-of-sample forecasts and to pool\\nevidence across studies—the usual beneﬁts of a structural econometric approach.\\nDiscrete outcomes arise in analyses of employment, health and migration. Yet a\\nsubstantial amount of research in the evaluation literature assumes outcomes are\\ncontinuous or makes special assumptions for analysis of discrete data outcomes.\\n(see, e.g., Card and Sullivan, 1988; Gritz, 1993; Gay and Borus, 1980; Heckman and\\nRobb, 1985; Ham and Lalonde, 1996; Ridder, 1986). The methodology we propose\\nand implement in this paper and a companion technical paper (Aakvik et al., 1999) is\\nsufﬁciently ﬂexible to accommodate discrete, continuous and mixed discretecontinuous outcome (e.g. Tobit) variables and can be generalized to panel data\\nsettings. (see Carneiro et al., 2003). In this paper, we focus on single-period models\\nwith discrete outcomes.\\nWe apply our methods to estimate the impact of Norwegian Vocational\\nRehabilitation Programs (VR) on employment for female applicants. These\\nprograms offer income maintenance payments and training programs to individuals\\nwhose medical conditions result in reduced productivity in the labor market and\\nwhom program administrators believe will beneﬁt from these services. The primary\\ngoal of these programs is to allow recently disabled persons to reenter the labor force.\\nWe use this application to illustrate how our methodology can address four\\nquestions: (1) What is the overall effect of training on employment probabilities? (2)\\nWhich groups of individuals beneﬁt most from participation in training? (3) How\\nimportant is it to control for unobservables in understanding the selection and\\noutcome processes?

Abadie / Journal of Econometrics 113 (2003) 231 – 263\\n\\nA variety of methods have been proposed to overcome the selection problem (for\\na review see Heckman and Robb, 1985). The traditional approach relies on distributional assumptions and functional form restrictions to identify average treatment e(ects\\nand other treatment parameters of interest. Unfortunately, estimators based on this approach can be seriously biased by modest departures from the parametric assumptions\\n(Goldberger, 1983). In addition, a number of researchers have noted that strong parametric assumptions are not necessary to identify treatment parameters of interest (see\\ne.g., Heckman, 1990; Imbens and Angrist, 1994; Manski, 1997). Consequently, it is\\ndesirable to develop robust estimators of treatment parameters based on nonparametric\\nor semiparametric identi.cation procedures.\\nMotivated by these considerations, this article introduces a new class of instrumental\\nvariable (IV) estimators of linear and nonlinear average treatment response models with\\ncovariates. In the spirit of Roehrig (1988), identi.cation is attained nonparametrically\\nand does not depend on the choice of the parametric speci.cation for the response function of interest. The main advantage of this approach is that it allows the researcher to\\nconstruct estimators that can be interpreted as the parameters of a well-de.ned approximation to a treatment response function under functional form misspeci.cation. On the\\nother hand, if required, functional form restrictions and distributional assumptions can\\nbe accommodated in the analysis. As in the IV model of Imbens and Angrist (1994)\\nand Angrist et al. (1996), identi.cation comes from a binary instrument that induces\\nexogenous selection into treatment for some subset of the population. In contrast with\\nImbens and Angrist (1994) and Angrist et al. (1996), the approach taken here easily\\naccommodates covariates and can be used to estimate nonlinear models with a binary\\nendogenous regressor.\\nThe ability to control for covariates is important because instruments may require\\nconditioning on a set of covariates to be valid. Covariates can also be used to re7ect\\nobservable di(erences in the composition of populations, making extrapolation more\\ncredible. Another feature of the approach taken here, the ability to estimate nonlinear models, is important because in some cases, such as evaluation problems with\\nlimited dependent variables, the underlying response function of interest is inherently\\nnonlinear. As a by-product of the general framework introduced here, I develop an\\nIV estimator that provides a linear least squares approximation to an average treatment resp                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

For personal use only.\\n\\nThe nature of empirical research in economics has profoundly changed since the emergence in the\\n1990s of a new way to understand identification in econometric models. This approach emphasizes\\nthe importance of heterogeneity across units in the parameters of interest and of the choice of the\\nsources of variation in the data that are used to estimate those parameters. Initial impetus came from\\nempirical research by Angrist, Ashenfelter, Card, Krueger and others, while Angrist, Heckman,\\nImbens, Manski, Rubin, and others provided many of the early methodological innovations (see, in\\nparticular, Angrist 1990, Angrist & Krueger 1991, Angrist et al. 1996, Card 1990, Card & Krueger\\n1994, Heckman 1990, Manski 1990; for earlier contributions, see Ashenfelter 1978, Ashenfelter\\n& Card 1985, Heckman & Robb 1985).\\nWhile this greater emphasis on identification has permeated all brands of econometrics and\\nquantitative social science, nowhere have the effects been felt more profoundly than in the field\\nof program evaluation—a domain expanding the social, biomedical, and behavioral sciences that\\nstudies the effects of policy interventions. The policies of interest are often governmental programs, like active labor market interventions or antipoverty programs. In other instances, the term\\npolicy is more generally understood to include any intervention of interest by public or private\\nagents or by nature.\\nIn this article, we offer an overview of classical tools and recent developments in the econometrics of program evaluation and discuss potential avenues for future research. Our focus is on ex\\npost evaluation exercises, where the effects of a policy intervention are evaluated after some form\\nof the intervention (such as a regular implementation of the policy, an experimental study, or a\\npilot study) is deployed and the relevant outcomes under the intervention are measured. Many\\nstudies in economics and the social sciences aim to evaluate existing or experimentally deployed\\ninterventions, and the methods surveyed in this article have been shown to have broad applicability\\nin these settings. In many other cases, however, economists and social scientists are interested in\\nex ante evaluation exercises, that is, in estimating the effect of a policy before such policy is implemented on the population of interest (e.g., Todd & Wolpin 2010). In the absence of measures\\nof the outcomes under the intervention of interest, ex ante evaluations aim to extrapolate outside\\nthe support of the data. Often, economic models that precisely describe the behavior of economic\\nagents serve as useful extrapolation devices for ex ante evaluations. Methods that are suitable for\\nex ante evaluation have been previously covered in the Annual Review of Economics (Arcidiacono &\\nEllickson 2011, Berry & Haile 2016).\\nThis distinction between ex ante and ex post program evaluations is closely related to oftendiscussed differences between the so-called structural and causal inference schools in econometrics.\\nThe use of economic models as devices to extrapolate outside the support of the data in ex ante\\nprogram evaluation is typically associated with the structural school, while ex post evaluations\\nthat do not explicitly extrapolate using economic models of behavior are often termed causal or\\nreduced form.1 Given that they serve related but quite distinct purposes, we find the perceived\\nconflict between these two schools to be                                                                                                                                                               \n",
